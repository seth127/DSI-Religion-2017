   South Korea, officially known as the Republic of Korea (ROK; Korean: 대한민국, ), ) is an East Asian country occupying the southern half of the Korean Peninsula. To the north, it is bordered by North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), with which it was united until 1945. To the west, across the Yellow Sea, lies China and to the southeast, across the Korea Strait, lies Japan. The Republic of Korea in Korean means "The Great Nation of the Korean People" and is sometimes referred to as the "Land of the Morning Calm", originating from the peaceful Joseon Dynasty. The capital and largest city of South Korea is Seoul, the world's 2nd largest metropolitan city. The official language of South Korea is Korean and is currently the 10th most spoken language in the world.http://www.le.ac.uk/eg/fss1/The%20most%20spoken%20languages%20in%20the%20world.htm The Korean people trace their nation's founding back to 2333 BCE by the legendary Dangun Wanggeom. Archaeological research shows that the first Korean settlers have occupied the peninsula since the Lower Paleolithic period with territories expanding as far as mainland China and eastern Russia during the Gojoseon period, the first nation established by Koreans. Following the era of the Three Korean Kingdoms and the Joseon Dynasty, Korea's history has been turbulent at times with the last emperor of Korea dating back to the age of the Korean Empire. Since the establishment of the modern republic in 1948, South Korea has struggled with the aftermath of Japanese exploitation (1910-1945), the Korean War (1950-1953), and decades of authoritarian regimes in favour of the strong pursuit on the industrialization and economic development of South Korea. However, as the standard of living and income of South Korean citizens rose considerably in the late 1980s, nationwide demonstrations lead to the collapse of the authoritarian government in 1987 and since then, direct and fair elections were held every 5 years in South Korea. Today, South Korea is an established pioneer of stable democracy in Asia, with South Korean citizens enjoying one of the highest level of poltical freedom and social rights in Asia. South Korea is a major global industrial power and had one of the fastest growing economies in the world since the 1960s. The South Korean economy is now developed and the 3rd largest  in Asia and the 12th largest  in the world. South Korea is one of the Top 10 exporters in the world, having the 6th largest foreign exchange reserves in the world. South Korea is also an international military power, having the 6th largest armed forces in the world and being one of the Top 10 highest military expenditure countries in the world. In the late 20th century, many people referred to South Korea as a Newly Industrialized Country and an Asian Tiger due to its reputation for exponential economic growth. To this date, South Korea is still among the world's fastest growing developed countrieshttp://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1018.html and at current pace, it will be the world's 3rd richest country by 2025 with a GNP per capita of $52,000.http://www.korea.net/news/news/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20051211008&part=104&SearchDay= South Korea was one of the founding members of APEC and in 1996, South Korea became a member of the OECD, a milestone in its development history. Today, South Korea forms the G20 industrial nations,  being the only developed Next Eleven state with many developing countries referring to its economic success as the "Miracle on the Han River," using South Korea's success story as a role model.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,361781,00.html South Korea has a "High" HDI of 0.921 and is part of both the CIA and IMF lists of advanced economies, being defined as a High Income Nation by the World Bank. International recognition of the country and its goods & services was enhanced by the hosting of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and further boosted by the co-hosting of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. South Korea is one of the world's most technologically and scientifically advanced countries, having the most intelligent population in the world with a National IQ of 106 along with a heated focus on education, being directly linked with its strong performance in mathematics and sciencehttp://www.rlynn.co.uk/pages/article_intelligence/6.asp &mdash; it is a major driving factor behind the South Korean economy and its high-tech industries. It is the only country in the world having state of the art nationwide DMB Digital Mobile TV, WiBro High-Speed Wireless Broadband, 100Mbit/s Fibre-Optic Cable Broadband, full HDTV Broadcasting and 3G HSDPA. It is currently the most wired nation in the world, with more than 95% of all homes connected to high speed broadband internet. South Korea is a global leader in electronics, computers, digital displays, semiconductor devices, mobile phones and hightech gadgets, lead by the two chaebols, Samsung and LG. South Korea also boasts the world's 3rd largest steel producer, POSCO and is the world's 5th largest automobile manufacturing nation, headed by Hyundai Kia Automotive Group. South Korea is the world's largest shipbuilder, lead by several multinational corporations such as Hyundai Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries. Other important industries of South Korea include robotics and biotechnology, with the world's first walking humanoid robot, HUBO, the world's second female android EveR-1, and the world's first cloned dog, Snuppy.   The government of South Korea is divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. Local governments are semi-autonomous, and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. The South Korean government's structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. This document has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 (see history of South Korea). However, it has retained many broad characteristics; with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea, the country has always had a presidential system with a relatively independent chief executive.  http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ks00000_.html The Constitution of Republic of Korea   Archeological findings indicate that the Korean peninsula was occupied by humans as early in the Lower Paleolithic period. Korea began with the legendary founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by Dangun.http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm Gojoseon expanded until it controlled much of the northern Korean peninsula and parts of Manchuria. After numerous wars with the Chinese Han Dynasty, Gojoseon disintegrated, leading to the Proto-Three Kingdoms of Korea period. In the early centuries of the Common Era, Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and the Samhan confederacy occupied the peninsula and southern Manchuria. Of the various small states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla grew to control the peninsula as rival kingdoms. Introduction of Buddhism and other influences from China had profound effects on Korea, which later passed on, combined with Korean advances, to Japan."Yayoi Period History Summary," BookRags.com; Jared Diamond, "Japanese Roots," Discover 19:6 (June 1998); Thayer Watkins, "The Genetic Origins of the Japanese"; "Shinto - History to 1900," Encyclopædia Britannica; "The Yayoi period (c. 250 BC–c.

ISBN 0-8047-0523-2From Paekche to Origin of Yamato The unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 CE led to the North-South States period, in which the much of the Korean peninsula was controlled by Unified Silla, while Balhae succeeded the northern parts of Goguryeo. In Unified Silla, poetry and art was encouraged, and Buddhist culture flourished. Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time. However, Unified Silla weakened under internal strife, and surrendered to Goryeo in 935. Balhae, Silla's neighbor to the north, was formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of Russia. It fell to the Khitan in 926 CE. After the North-South Period, successor states fought for control during the Later Three Kingdoms period. The peninsula was soon united by Wang Geon of Goryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state and  created the Jikji in 1377, using the world's oldest movable metal printing press. World's oldest printed Doc The Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened Goryeo. However, Goryeo continued to rule Korea as a tributary ally to the Mongols. After the fall of the Mognolian Empire, which by the time was known as the Yuan Dynasty, Goryeo continued its rule. After severe political strife and continued invasions, Goryeo was soon replaced by the Joseon Dynasty in 1388 CE following a rebellion by General Yi Seong-gye.  General Yi declared the new name of Korea as Joseon in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Seoul. The first 200 years of the Joseon Dynasty was marked by relative peace and saw the creation of hangul by King Sejong the Great in the 14 century CE and the rise and influence of Confucianism. In the latter of the 16th century CE, Joseon was invaded by a newly unfied Japan. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598), centuries of peace had left the dynasty unprepared, and the lack of technology and poor leadership from the government and generals led to the destruction of much of the Korean peninsula. However, continued Korean dominance at sea led by Admiral Yi, the rise of local militias, and the intervention of Ming China put Japan under great pressure to retreat in 1598 CE. Today, Admiral Yi is celebrated as one of Korea's foremost heroes and his turtle ships, used with great success against the Japanese, are considered the world's first ironclad warships, although lack of hard evidence of iron plating sparks much debate. During the last years of the Joseon Dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the name the "Hermit Kingdom," primarily for protection against Western imperialism. In 1910 CE, Korea was annexed by Japan and despite widespread resistance, remained under occupation until the end of World War II in 1945 CE.   In the aftermath of World War II, Soviet Union and United States troops controlled the northern and southern halves of the country respectively. The two Cold War rivals established governments sympathetic to their own ideologies, leading to Korea's division into two political entities: North Korea and South Korea. Despite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating Cold War antagonism eventually led to the establishment of two separate governments: the communist North and the capitalist South.  In the North, a former anti-Japanese guerilla and communist activist, Kim Il Sunghttp://www.bartleby.com/65/ki/KimIlSun.html and in the South, freshly shipped from America, Syngman Rhee were installed as presidents.http://www.bartleby.com/65/rh/Rhee-Syn.html On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded the South leading to the Korean War. The Soviet boycott of the United Nations at the time, and therefore, no veto, allowed the UN to intervene when it became apparent that the superior communist forces would easily take over the entire country.  The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the participation of millions of Chinese troops. After huge advances on both sides, the war eventually reached a stalemate.  The 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line.  No peace treaty was ever signed and the two countries are still technically at war. In 1960, a student uprising led to the resignation of the autocratic and corrupt President Syngman Rhee.   A period of profound civil unrest and general political instability followed, broken by General Park Chung-hee's military coup (the "5.16 coup d'etat") against the weak and ineffectual government the next year. Park took over as president until his assassination in 1979, overseeing rapid export-led economic growth as well as severe political repression. Park is heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, although the Korean economy developed significantly during his tenure. The years after Park's assassination were marked by, again, considerable political turmoil as the previously repressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void.  In 1980, there was a coup d'etat, by General Chun Doo-hwan against the transitional government of Choi Gyu Ha, the interim president and a former prime minister under Park.  Chun assumed the presidency.  His seizure of power triggered nationwide protest demanding democracy, in particular the city of Gwangju, in South Cholla province where Chun sent in special forces to violently suppress the city, in what is now known as the Gwangju Massacre. Until 1987, he and his government held Korea under despotic rule when Park Jong Chul- a student attending Seoul National University - was tortured to death.  http://www.yolsa.org/sub_plus_1.html Yolsa.org Information on Anti-Yushin protests   The Catholic Priests' Association for Justice revealed that Park was tortured, igniting huge demonstrations around the country. The demonstrations snowballed when another student from Yonsei University, Lee Han Yeol, was killed by a police-fired tear gas bomb while he was demonstrating against the military government.  The period of resistance is called the Resistance of June when all joined the national movment.  Eventually, Chun's party, the Democratic Justice Party, and its leader, Roh Tae Woo announced the June 29th Declaration, which included the direct election of the president.  http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?gs=ws&gd=&cd=&q=&p=&masterno=211762&contentno=211762 Encyber Encylopedia article on June 29th Declaration   In 1988, Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, a cause of both national and international celebration in contrast to great turmoil of the past. In 1996, South Korea became a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a testament to further economic growth. As with many of its Asian neighbors, South Korea uffered the Asian financial crisis in 1997, butthe country was able to re-emerge and continue its growth towards a major economic power after a swift recovery.  http://www.ecplaza.net/news/0/7299/imf_financial_crisis.html Ecplaza on East Asian Financial Crisis  In June 2000, as part of South Korean president Kim Dae Jung's Sunshine Policy of engagement, a North-South summit took place in Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea. That year, Former President Kim received the Nobel Peace Prize "for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular."  http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2000/index.html Nobel Peace Prize Recipient in 2000  In 2004, South Korea joined the "trillion dollar club" of world economies. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ks.html CIA World Factbook   In its foreign relations, South Korea has main strategic intersts in North Korea and the neighboring nations of China, Japan, and Russia, as well as its main ally, the United States. A Brief History of the US-Korea Relations Prior to 1945 [ ]   The United States of America was the primary driver in the establishment and initial sustainment of the South Korean government before and after the Korean War. The two nations have enjoyed both strong economic and diplomatic ties after the Korean War, although they have often been at odds with regard to their policies towards North Korea during former president Kim Dae Jung and Roh Moo-Hyun's terms. There was a spike of anti-American sentiment, although U.S-Korea relations have steadily improved since the election of current president Lee Myung Bak. freekorea.us - OFK Archive: Anti-Americanism in Korea–The Statistical Recordoften expressed toward members of the U.S. military,http://freekorea.us/2005/08/07/signs-of-the-times-so-this-is-why-i-spent-four-years-in-korea/ sometimes violently. In April 2007, Korea concluded a Free Trade Agreement agreement with the United States. Historically, Korea had relatively close relations with China. Before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters also worked with Chinese soldiers during the period of Japanese occupation. However, after World War II, the Chinese embraced communism while South Korea became a representative democracy with the help of the United Nations and the United States. The People's Republic of China assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and China almost completely ceased. Relations thawed gradually however, and South Korea and China established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992.  The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the fourty-year old trade embargo, and http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FI11Dg03.html Korea-China relations have improved steadily since 1992.http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FI11Dg03.html Although there were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan after the Korean War, South Korea and Japan signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties. There are still heavy Anti-Japanese sentiments in South Korea due to a number of unsettled Korean-Japanese disputes, many of which stems from the period of Japanese occupation. During World War II, more than 100,000 Koreans were forced to serve in the Imperial Japanese Army.  A Brief History of the US-Korea Relations Prior to 1945. [ ]　"While less than 100 Koreans in America enlisted in the US military during World War II, more than 100,000 Koreans served in the Japanese army as officers and soldiers.  There were two Korean Lt. Generals in the Japanese Army: a Chosun prince, whose rank was honorary and who commanded no troops; and Lt. Gen. Hong Sa-Ik, who was a professional military man from the old Chosun army."  Longstanding issues such as Korea under Japanese rule against Korean civilians, the visits by Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine honoring Japanese soldiers killed at war, including class A war criminals like Hideki Tojo, the re-writing of Japanese textbooks to overlook Japanese aggression during World War II, and the territorial disputes over Liancourt Rocks continue to trouble Korean-Japanese relations. In response to then-Prime Minister Jun'ichiro Koizumi's repeated visits to the Yasukuni shrine, the President of South Korea Roh Moo-hyun suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan.http://www.voanews.com/Korean/archive/2006-03/2006-03-17-voa12.cfm Presently, South Korea and Japan's political relations are unstable but thawing progressively, and the newly-elected President of Korea, Lee Myung-Bak, held a summit meeting with Yasuo Fukuda, the current Prime Minister of Japan. Both North and South Korea continue to officially claim sovereignty over the entire peninsula and any outlying islands. With longstanding animosity following the Korean War from 1950-1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an agreement to pursue peace on October 4, 2007. On October 4th, 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il signed an 8-point peace agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad. Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, and another in 2006. Recently, North Korea agreed to temporarily suspend its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program for economic and diplomatic support, although some Korean and American officials criticized the North for not being fully cooperative in its temporary suspension of a nuclear weapons program.  http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,251618,00.html  South Korea maintains diplomatic relations with approximately 170 countries.  The country has also been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea. On January 1, 2007, South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon assumed the post of UN Secretary-General. It has also developed links with Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of ASEAN Plus three, a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS). There is an ongoing efforts at negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union, the second largest importer of Korean goods. http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=5202   The South Korean military is composed of the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA), Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN), Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF), and Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC) together with reserve forces. GlobalSecurity on Militar of Republic of Korea http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/rok/index.html Many of these forces are concentrated near the border with North Korea, near and around the demilitarized zone. All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically for a period of two years. However, there has been debates about shortening the length of the military services, and even dismissing the mandatory service itself. The government recently allowed some male students who was in the process of earning a university bachelor's degree and master's degree to dismiss the military requirements to let them to further study and research on their fields. From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. It has participated in most major conflict the United States has been involved in the past 50 years.  South Korea dispatched 320,000 troops to fight alongside American, Australian and South Vietnamese soldiers in the Vietnam War, with a peak strength of 50,000. Most recently, South Korea sent 3,300 troops of the Zaytun Division to help re-building in northern Iraq, and is the largest contributor in the coalition forces after the U.S. and Britain.Zaytun Division official website The United States has stationed a substantial contingent of troops in South Korea since the Korean War to defend South Korea in case of a North Korean attack.  There are also approximately 29,000 US soldiers stationed in Korea,  America's Unsinkable Fleet  most of them serving one year of unaccompanied tours. The American Troops are stationed in bases, of which most are camps, which are considered camps not for their lack of buildings or support structure but in order to represent a lack of permanence. A still functioning UN Command controls all forces in South Korea, including the US forces and the entire Korean military. (See List of United States Army installations in South Korea and USFK for more information on these military bases.) Currently, the South Korean navy is working towards being a blue-water navy. It has recently required its first Aegis Combat System-enabled destroyer, the  King Sejong the Great class destroyer. South Korea is the fifth country to begin operating an Aegis Combat System-enabled surface ship.http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2007/12/180_3687.html See also Special cities of Korea and Provinces of Korea     South Korea occupies the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula, which extends some 680 miles (1,100&nbsp;km) from the Asian mainland.  This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the Yellow Sea to the west, and the Sea of Japan (East Sea)  to the east.  Its southern tip lies on the Korea Strait and the East China Sea.  The country's total area is .The estimated area rises steadily from year to year, possibly due to land reclamation. ; South Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow coastal plains; a western region of broad coastal plains, river basins, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the Nakdong River. South Korea's land is mostly mountainous, of which most is not arable. Lowlands, located primarily in the west and southeast, constitute only 30% of the total land area.  About three thousand islands, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea. Jeju Island is located about 100 kilometers (about 60&nbsp;mi) off the southern coast of South Korea. It is the country's largest island, with an area of 1,845 square kilometers (712&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Jeju is also the site of South Korea's highest point:  Halla-san, an extinct volcano, reaches 1,950 meters (6,398&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The most eastern islands of South Korea include Ulleungdo and Dokdo, while Marado and Ieodo are the southernmost islands of South Korea. The local climate is relatively temperate, with precipitation heavier in summer during a short rainy season called jangma, and winters that can be bitterly cold.   In Seoul, the average January temperature range is -7 °C to 1 °C (19 °F to 33 °F), and the average July temperature range is 22 °C to 29 °C (71 °F to 83 °F). Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late dfdfdfdfdfdfdfdfdfdfdfdfsummer typhoons that bring strong winds and heavy rains.  The average annual precipitation varies from  1,370 millimeters (54&nbsp;inches) in Seoul to 1,470 millimeters (58&nbsp;inches) in Busan.  There are occasional typhoons that bring high winds and floods. The government is concerned of the impact of global warming on the natural disasters. In urban areas there are problems associated with air pollution as well as water pollution from the discharge of sewage and industrial effluents. Cheonggyecheon is one of the recent attempts at restoring the flow of the clean water in South Korea. http://english.seoul.go.kr/gover/initiatives/inti_02cheon.htm South Korean is a member of numerous international environmental organizations with specific regards to Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, and Whaling.    South Korea is a major international economic power; it has the 12-14th economy    in the world and the 4th    in Asia, behind Japan, China and India. Its largest trading partner and export market today is China.Trade Policy Outlook for Second-term Bush Administration South Korea has achieved rapid economic growth through exports of manufactured goods, and is one of the Four Asian Tigers. Major industries in South Korea today are automobiles, semiconductors, electronics, shipbuilding, and steel. In the 1950s, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in Asia. This was partly due to the destruction of much of the country's infrastructure during the Korean War.  Following the military coup led by General Park Chung-hee in 1962, South Korea embarked on a series of ambitious five-year plans for economic development similar to the macro-economic schemes of the Soviet Union. http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/stalin/lectures/EconDev.html  Emphasis shifted to foreign trade with the normalization of relations with Japan in 1965, which resulted in a boom in trade and investment. Rapid expansion, first into light and then heavy industries, so in 1973 Korea became the 34th wealthiest country in the world. http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_197-economy-gdp-per-capita-1973  Park's government plans for economic development greatly boosted the Korean economy. This growth is often called the "Miracle on the Han River", the Han River being the main river that runs through the nation's capital and largest city, Seoul. In the 1980s and 1990s, growth continued as South Korea transformed itself from an exporter of mostly textiles and shoes into a major global producer of automobiles, electronics, shipbuilding, steel and, later, high-technology products such as digital monitors, mobile phones, and semiconductors. The South Korean model of encouraging the growth of large, internationally competitive companies through easy financing and tax incentives led to the dominance of the family-controlled conglomerates. These companies, known as chaebol, flourished under the support of the Park regime.See Cumings 1997, chapter 6. Some such as Hyundai, Samsung, LG and SK Company became global corporations.  Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997 the corporate landscape has changed considerably as a result of massive bankruptcies and government reforms. The crisis exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's economy, including high debt-to-equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing, and an undisciplined financial sector. This led to two rounds of financial and industrial restructuring; once in 1997 and again following the collapse of Daewoo in 1999.KOIS (2003), pp. 238-239. Daewoo's collapse has been recorded as one of the largest bankruptcies in world history.[ ] Paper: Economic Reform in South Korea: An Unfinished Legacy By 2003, just over one-half of the 30 largest chaebol from 1995 remained.18 out of 30, according to  Between 2003 and 2005, economic growth had slowed to about 4% per year. A downturn in consumer spending, attributed to massive personal credit card debt, was offset by rapid export growth, primarily to China. In 2005, the government proposed labor reform legislation and a corporate pension scheme to help make the labor market more flexible, and new real estate policies to cool property speculation. In 2006, South Korean economy has recovered its growth rate to 5.1%. The South Korean economy is characterized by moderate inflation, low unemployment, an export surplus, and fairly equal distribution of income.   Today, there are several strong South Korean industries. South Korea's largest automaker, Hyundai Motor Company and its subsidiary Kia Motors are the 5th largest car group in the world.[ ] Korean carmakers are planning to increase their exports even more when Korea finishes its FTA with the European Union.[ ] South Korea's shipbuilding industry is also the largest in the world. It became the largest after overtaking Japan in 2004.[ ] South Korean shipbuilding is efficient enough that a new $80 million vessel is produced every four working days. In 2006, approximately one in every three new vessels was constructed in Korea. Hyundai Heavy Industries built ships totaling 10.6 million compensated gross tons (CGTs), or 34.6 percent, becoming the first nation to breach the 10 million CGT mark.[ ] Other Korean shipbuilding companies are Samsung Heavy Industries and Daewoo Marine Engineering & Construction. Although South Korean shipmakers are leading in terms of ship orders and production, they are wary of Chinese shipmakers. China is planning to become the world's leader in shipbuilding by 2015. However, South Korean shipbuilders have advantage over Chinese counterparts in terms of advanced value-added shipbuilding technology.   Transportation in South Korea is provided by an extensive network of railways, highways, bus routes, ferry services, and air routes. Buses, taxis, subways, and trains provide comfortable and cheap methods of travel around South Korea. Major cities have subway systems, including the popular Seoul Subway. Korail commuter lines are already linked with Seoul's subway system and several commuter lines connected with Busan and Daegu subway systems are under construction. They have intercity and intracity bus systems. Metropolitan Cities have express bus terminals. Highways in South Korea are classified into highways (expressways/motorways), national highways, and various classifications below the national level. Korea Highway Corporation operates the toll highways and service amenities en route. South Korea has about 3,000 kilometers of national highways.  Korail provides frequent train service to all major South Korean cities. Two rail lines, Gyeongui and Donghae Bukbu Line, to North Korea are now being reconnected. The Korean high-speed railway system, KTX, provides  high-speed service along Gyeongbu and Honam Line. KTX had been built with France and Japan's technological cooperation, but government intentionally had made it non-public. The main international airport is Incheon International Airport. South Korea has eight international airports and seven domestic airports. South Korea's major international air carriers are Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. About 71 international passenger and cargo airlines operate frequent flight services between Korea and all over the world.  South Korea also leads the world in the shipbuilding industry, headed by chaebols such as the Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industry and POSCO.
