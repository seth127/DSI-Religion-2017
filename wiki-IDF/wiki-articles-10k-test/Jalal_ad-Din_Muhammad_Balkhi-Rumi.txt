   Mawlānā Jalāl-ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī (), also known as Mawlānā Jalāl-ad-Dīn Muhammad Balkhī (), but known to the English-speaking world simply as Rumi, (September 30, 1207–December 17, 1273), was a 13th century Persian (Tādjīk)C.E. Bosworth/B.G. Fragner, "Tādjīk", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Online Edition: "... In Islamic usage, [Tādjīk] eventually came to designate the Persians, as opposed to Turks [...] the oldest citation for it which Schaeder could find was in verses of Djalāl al-Dīn Rūmī ..."B.

Rumi is a descriptive name meaning "the Roman" since he lived most parts of his life in Anatolia which had been part of the Roman Empire until the Seljuq conquest two centuries earlier.Schwartz, Stephen (May 14, 2007) "The Balkin Front." Weekly Standard. While historical sources claim that he was born in Balkh, Afghanistan ( - Balḫ), the hometown of his father's family, modern scholars now believe that Rumi was probably born in 1207 CE in Wakhsh (Waḫš),Annemarie Schimmel, "I Am Wind, You Are Fire," p. 11. She  refers to an (1989) article by the German scholar, Fritz Meier: "Afghan and Persian admirers still prefer to call Jalaluddin 'Balkhi'  because his family lived in Balkh before migrating westward. However, their home was not in the actual city of Balkh, since the mid-eighth century a center of Muslim culture in Khorasan (now Afghanistan). Rather, as the Swiss scholar Fritz Meier has shown, it was in the small town of Wakhsh north of the Oxus that Baha'uddin Walad, Jalaluddin's father, lived and worked as a jurist  and preacher with mystical inclinations."  Franklin Lewis, "Rumi--Past and Present, East and West: The Life,  Teachings, and Poetry of Jalâl al-Din Rumi," 2000, paperback 2003, pp. 47-49. Professor Lewis has devoted two full pages of his book to the topic of Wakhsh, which he states has been identified with the medieval town of Lêwkand (or Lâvakand) or Sangtude, which is about 65 kilometers southeast of Dushanbe, the capital of present-day Tajikistan. He says it is on the east bank of the Vakhshâb river, a major tributary that joins the Amu Daryâ river (also called Jayhun, and named the Oxus by the Greeks). He further states: "Bahâ al-Din may have been born in Balkh, but at least between June 1204 and 1210 (Shavvâl 600 and 607), during which time Rumi was born, Bahâ al-Din resided in a house in Vaksh (Bah 2:143 [= Bahâ' uddîn Walad's] book, "Ma`ârif."). Vakhsh, rather than Balkh, was the permanent base of Bahâ al-Din and his family until Rumi was around five years old (mei 16-35) [= from a book in German by the scholar Fritz Meier--note inserted here]. At that time, in about the year 1212 (A.H. 608-9), the Valads moved to Samarqand (Fih 333; Mei 29-30, 36) [= reference to Rumi's "Discourses" and to Fritz Meier's book--note inserted here], leaving behind Baâ al-Din's mother, who must have been at least seventy-five years old." a small town located at the river Wakhsh in what is now Tajikistan and mentioned in Rumi's poetry. Wakhsh belonged to the larger province of Balkh, and in the year Rumi was born, his father was an appointed scholar there. Both these cities were at the time included in the Greater Persian cultural sphere of Khorāṣān, the easternmost province of historical Persia,Franklin Lewis, Rumi Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2000. “How is it that a Persian boy born almost eight hundred years ago in Khorasan, the northeastern province of greater Iran, in a region that we identify today as Central Asia, but was considered in those days as part of the greater Persian cultural sphere, wound up in Central Anatolia on the receding edge of the Byzantine cultural sphere, in which is now Turkey, some 1500 miles to the west?”(pg 9) and were part of the Khwarezmian Empire.

Chap1 or fear of the impending Mongol cataclysm,Encyclopedia Iranica, “Baha Al-Din Mohammad Walad” [ ], H. Algar. his father decided to migrate westwards. Rumi's family traveled west, first performing the Hajj and eventually settling in the Anatolian city Konya (capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, now located in Turkey), where he lived most of his life, composed one of the crowning glories of Persian literature and profoundly affected the culture of the area.C.E. Bosworth, "Turkish Expansion towards the west" in UNESCO HISTORY OF HUMANITY, Volume IV, titled "From the Seventh to the Sixteenth Century", UNESCO Publishing / Routledge, p. 391: "While the Arabic language retained its primacy in such spheres as law, theology and science, the culture of the Seljuk court and secular literature within the sultanate became largely Persianized; this is seen in the early adoption of Persian epic names by the Seljuq Rulers (Qubad, Kay Khusraw and so on) and in the use of Persian as a literary language (Turkish must have been essentially a vehicle for every days speech at this time). The process of Persianization accelerated in the thirteenth century with the presence in Konya of two of the most distinguished refugees fleeing before the Mongols, Baha al-din Walad and his son Mawlana Jalal al-din Rumi, whose Mathnawi, composed in Konya, constitutes one of the crowning glories of classical Persian literature. He lived most of his life under the Sultanate of Rum, where he produced his worksBank, Coleman, Rumi: The Book of Love: Poems of Ecstasy and Longing, p. xxv Harper Collins (2005), ISBN 0-06-075050-2 and died in 1273 CE. He was buried in Konya and his shrine became a place of pilgrimage.Note: Rumi's shrine is now known as the Mevlana Museum in Turkey Following his death, his followers and his son Sultan Walad founded the Mawlawīyah Sufi Order, also known as the order of the Whirling Dervishes, famous for its Sufi dance known as the samāʿ ceremony. Rumi's work are written in the new Persian Language.  New Persian (also called Dari-Persian or Dari), a widely understood vernacular of Middle Persian, has its linguistic origin in the Fars Province of modern Iran.(Lazard, Gilbert 1975, “The Rise of the New Persian Language” in Frye, R. N., The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 4, pp. 595-632, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.)"The language known as New Persian, which usually called at this period by the name of Dari or Parsi-Dari,can be classified linguistically as a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of Sassanian Iran, itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenids. Unlike the other languages and dialects, ancient and modern, of the Iranian group such as Avestan, Parthian, Soghdian, Kurdish, Pashto, etc., Old Middle and New Persian represent one and the same language at three states of its history. It had its origin in Fars (the true Persian country from the historical point of view and is differentiated by dialectical features, still easily recognizable from the dialect prevailing in north-western and eastern Iran".  A Dari-Persian literary renaissance (In the 8th/9th century) started in regions of Sistan, Khorasan and Transoxiana Lazard, Gilbert 1975, “The Rise of the New Persian Language” in Frye, R. N., The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 4, pp. 595-632, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.   (Lapidus, Ira, 2002, A Brief History of Islamic Societies, "Under Arab rule, Arabic became the principal language for administration and religion. The substitution of Arabic for Middle Persian was facilitated by the translation of Persian classics into Arabic. Arabic became the main vehicle of Persian high culture, and remained such will into the eleventh century. Parsi declined and was kept alive mainly by the Zoroastrian priesthood in western Iran. The Arab conquests however, helped make Dari rather than Arabic the most common spoken language in Khurasan and the lands beyond the Oxus River. Paradoxically, Arab and Islamic domination created a Persian cultural region in areas never before unified by Persian speech. A new Persian evolved out of this complex linguistic situation. In the ninth century the Tahirid governors of Khurasan began to have the old Persian language written in Arabic script rather than in pahlavi characters. At the same time, eastern lords in the small principalities began to patronize a local court poetry in an elevated form of Dari. The new poetry was inspired by Arabic verse forms, so that Iranian patrons who did not understand Arabic could comprehend and enjoy the presentation of an elevated and dignified poetry in the manner of Baghdad. This new poetry flourished in regions where the influence of  Abbasid Arabic culture was attenuated and where it had no competition from the surviving tradition of Middle Persian literary classics cultivated for religious purposes as in Western Iran." "In the western regions, including Iraq, Syria and Egypt, and the lands of the far Islamic west including North Africa and Spain, Arabic became the predominant language of both high literary culture and spoken discourse." pp.125-132, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.)and by the 10th/11th century, it overtook Arabic as the literary and cultural language in the Persian Islamic world.  Although Rumi's works were written in Persian, Rumi's importance is considered to transcend national and ethnic borders. His original works are widely read in the original language across the Persian-speaking world. Translations of his works are very popular in South Asian, Turkic, Arab and Western countries. His poetry has influenced Persian literature as well as Urdu, Bengali and Turkish literatures. His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages in various formats, and BBC News has described him as the "most popular poet in America". He was born in Balkh which is in Afghanistan today Rumi's life is described in Shams ud-Din Ahmad Aflāki's "Manāqib ul-Ārifīn" (written between 1318 and 1353). His father was Bahā ud-Dīn Wālad, a theologian, jurist and a mystic from Balkh, who was also known during his lifetime as "Sultan of the Scholars". His mother was Mu'mina Ḫātūn. When the Mongols invaded Central Asia sometime between 1215 and 1220, his father with his whole family and a group of disciples set out westwards. On the road to Anatolia, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, Attar, in Iran's city of Nishapur, located in the province of Khorāsān. 'Attar immediately recognized Rumi's spiritual eminence. He saw the father walking ahead of the son and said, "Here comes a sea followed by an ocean." He gave the boy his Asrārnāma, a book about the entanglement of the soul in the material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the eighteen-year-old Rumi's thoughts and later on became the inspiration for his works. From Nishapur, Walad and his entourage set out for Baghdad, meeting many of the scholars and Sufis of the city.Ahmed, Nazeer, Islam in Global History: From the Death of Prophet Muhammed to the First World War, p.58, Xlibris Corporation (200), ISBN 0-7388-5962-1 From there they went to Baghdad, and Hejaz and performed the pilgrimage at Mecca. The migrating caravan then passed through Damascus, Malatya, Erzincan, Sivas, Kayseri and Nigde. They finally settled in Karaman during seven years. His mother and his brother died in Karaman. In 1225 Rumi married Gawhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: Sultan Walad and Alaeddin Çelebi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son Emir Alim Çelebi and a daughter Melike Khatun. On 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of 'Alā' ud-Dīn Key-Qobād, ruler of Anatolia, Baha' ud-Din came and finally settled in Konya in Anatolia within the westernmost territories of Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm. Baha' ud-Din became the head of a madrassa (religious school) and when he died Rumi inherited his position and succeeded him at the age of twenty-five. One of Baha' ud-Din's students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din-e Muhaqqiq, continued to train Rumi in the religious and mystical doctrines of Rumi's father. For nine years, Rumi practiced Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240-1. From then on started Rumi's public life. He became the teacher who preached in the mosques of Konya and taught his adherents in the madrassah. During this period Rumi also travelled to Damascus and is said to have spent four years there. It was his meeting with the dervish Shams-e Tabrizi on 15 November 1244 that changed his life completely. Shams had traveled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could "endure my company". A voice came, "What will you give in return?" "My head!" "The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya." On the night of December 5, 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is believed that he was murdered with the connivance of Rumi's son, 'Ala' ud-Din; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the privilege of mystical friendship. Rumi's love and his bereavement for the death of Shams found their expression in an outpouring of music, dance and lyric poems, Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi. He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realized: : Why should I seek? I am the same as : He. His essence speaks through me.  : I have been looking for myself! The Essential Rumi. Translations by Coleman Barks. pp xx  For more than ten years after meeting Shams, Mawlana had been spontaneously composing ghazals, and these had been collected in the Divan-i Kabir. Rumi found another companion in Salaḥ ud-Din-e Zarkub, the goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din's death, Rumi's scribe and favorite student Hussam-e Chelebi assumed the role. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside of Konya when Hussam described an idea he had to Rumi: "If you were to write a book like the Ilāhīnāma of Sanai or the Mantiq ut-Tayr of 'Attar it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it." Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his Masnavi, beginning with: : Listen to the reed and the tale it tells,  : How it sings of separation...   Hussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the Masnavi to Hussam. In December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known ghazal, which begins with the verse: : How doest thou know what sort of king I have within me as companion?  : Do not cast thy glance upon my golden face, for I have iron legs.  He died on December 17, 1273 in Konya; Rumi was laid to rest beside his father, and a splendid shrine, the Yeşil Türbe "Green Tomb" (original name:قبه لخزراء), was erected over his tomb. His epitaph reads: "When we are dead, seek not our tomb in the earth, but find it in the hearts of men."Mevlana Jalal al-din Rumi The general theme of his thoughts, like that of the other mystic and Sufi poets of the Persian literature, is essentially about the concept of Tawhīd (unity) and union with his beloved (the primal root) from which/whom he has been cut and fallen aloof, and his longing and desire for reunity. The "Masnavi" weaves fables, scenes from everyday life, Qur’anic revelations and exegesis, and metaphysics, into a vast and intricate tapestry. Rumi is considered an example of "insan-e kamil" — the perfected or completed human being. In the East, it is said of him, that he was, "not a prophet — but surely, he has brought a scripture". Rumi believed passionately in the use of music, poetry and dancing as a path for reaching God. For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine, and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of Whirling Dervishes developed into a ritual form. He founded the order of the Mevlevi, the "whirling" dervishes, and created the "Sema", their "turning", sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, Sema represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to "Perfect." In this journey the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth, and arrives at the "Perfect". The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey with greater maturity, so as to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination against beliefs, races, classes and nations. According to Shahram Shiva, one reason for Rumi's popularity is that "Rumi is able to verbalize the highly personal and often confusing world of personal/spiritual growth and mysticism in a very forward and direct fashion. He does not offend anyone, and he includes everyone. The world of Rumi is neither exclusively the world of a Sufi, nor the world of a Hindu, nor a Jew, nor a Christian; it is the highest state of a human being — a fully evolved human. A complete human is not bound by cultural limitations; he touches every one of us. Today Rumi's poems can be heard in churches, synagogues, Zen monasteries, as well as in the downtown New York art/performance/music scene."  According to Professor Majid M. Naini [ ], Rumi's life and transformation provide true testimony and proof that people of all religions and backgrounds can live together in peace and harmony.  Rumi’s visions, words, and life teach us how to reach inner peace and happiness so we can finally stop the continual stream of hostility and hatred and achieve true global peace and harmony. In other verses in Masnavi, Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love: Love’s nationality is separate from all other religions, The lover’s religion and nationality is the Beloved (God). The lover’s cause is separate from all other causes Love is the astrolabe of God’s mysteries.  Rumi's poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (rubayāt) and odes (ğazal) of the Divan, the six books of the Masnavi, the discourses, the letters, and the almost unknown Six Sermons. Rumi's philosophical outlook which was put into Persian poetry has significantly influenced universal culture. Rumi believed in the continuous progression of the soul through the process of life and death. Original Persian: از جمادی مُردم و نامی شدم --- وز نما مُردم بحیوان سرزدم مُردم از حیوانی و آدم شدم --- پس چه ترسم کی ز مردم کم شدم حملهء دیگر بمیرم از بشر --- تا برآرم از ملایک بال و پر وز ملک هم بایدم جستن ز جو --- کل شییء هالک الاوجهه بار دیگر از ملک پران شوم --- آنچه اندر وهم ناید آن شوم پس عدم گردم عدم چو ارغنون --- گویدم کانا الیه راجعون     Rumi's Universality What can I do, Submitters to God? I do not know myself. I am neither Christian nor Jew, neither Zoroastrian nor Muslim, I am not from east or west, not from land or sea, not from the shafts of nature nor from the spheres of the firmament, not of the earth, not of water, not of air, not of fire. I am not from the highest heaven, not from this world, not from existence, not from being. I am not from India, not from China, not from Bulgar, not from Saqsin, not from the realm of the two Iraqs, not from the land of Khurasan I am not from the world, not from beyond, not from heaven and not from hell. I am not from Adam, not from Eve, not from paradise and not from Ridwan. My place is placeless, my trace is traceless, no body, no soul, I am from the soul of souls. I have chased out duality, lived the two worlds as one. One I seek, one I know, one I see, one I call. He is the first, he is the last, he is the outer, he is the inner. Beyond "He" and "He is" I know no other. I am drunk from the cup of love, the two worlds have escaped me. I have no concern but carouse and rapture. If one day in my life I spend a moment without you from that hour and that time I would repent my life. If one day I am given a moment in solitude with you I will trample the two worlds underfoot and dance forever. O Sun of Tabriz (Shams Tabrizi), I am so tipsy here in this world, I have no tale to tell but tipsiness and rapture Rumi's importance transcends national and ethnic borders.Rumi Yoga Speakers of the Persian languages in Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan see him as one of their most significant classical poets and an influence on many poets through history.Life of Rumi He has also had a great influence on Turkish literature throughout the centuries.

Whirling Dervish Contemporary classical interpretations of his poetry are made by Muhammad Reza Shajarian (Iran), Shahram Nazeri (Iran), Davood Azad (Iran) and Ustad Mohammad Hashem Cheshti (Afghanistan). To many modern Westerners, his teachings are one of the best introductions to the philosophy and practice of Sufism. Pakistan's National Poet, Muhammad Iqbal (November 9, 1877-April 21, 1938) was also inspired by Rumi's works and considered him to be his spiritual leader and addressed him as Pir Rumi in his poems (the honorific Pir literally means old man, but in the sufi/mystic context it means founder, master, or guide). Rumi's work has been translated into many of the world's languages including Russian, German, Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, French, Italian and Spanish, and is appearing in a growing number of formats including concerts, workshops, readings, dance performances and other artistic creations. The English interpretations of Rumi's poetry by Coleman Barks have sold more than a half million copies worldwide.The Diploma of Honorary Doctorate of the University of Tehran in the field of Persian Language and Literature will be granted to Professor Coleman Barks Recordings of Rumi poems have made it to Billboard's Top 20 list.

These cultural, historical and linguistic ties between Rumi and the Iranian world have made Rumi an iconic Persian and Iranian poet. Rumi's poetry is displayed on the walls of many cities across the Persian-speaking world, sung in Persian music, and read in school books. Literally, Persian-speakers live with Rumi's poetry.  The Mawlawī Sufi order (Mawlawīyah or Mevlevi, as it is known in Turkey) was founded in 1273 by Rumi's followers after his death.Sufism His first successor in the rectorship of the order was Husam Chelebi himself, after whose death in 1284 Rumi's younger and only surviving son, Sultan Walad († 1312), favorably known as author of the mystical Maṭnawī Rabābnāma, or the "Book of the Guitar", was installed as grand master of the order.ISCA - The Islamic Supreme Council of America The leadership of the order has been kept in Rumi's family in Konya uninterruptedly since then. The Mawlawī Sufis, also known as "Whirling Dervishes", believe in performing their dhikr in the form of samāʿ. During the time of Rumi (as attested in the "Manākib ul-Ārefīn" of Aflākī), his followers gathered for musical and "turning" practices. Rumi himself was a notable musician who played the robāb although his favorite instrument was the ney.About the Mevlevi Order of America The music accompanying the traditional ritual consists of settings of poems from the Maṭnawī and Dīwān-e Kabīr or of Sultan Walad's poems. The Mawlawīyah was a well-established Sufi Order in the Ottoman Empire, and many of the members of the order served in various official positions of the Caliphate. The center for the Mawlawīyah was in Konya. There is also a Mawlawī monastery ( - dargāh) in Istanbul, near the Galata Tower, where the samāʿ ceremony is performed and accessible to the public. The Mawlawī order issues an invitation to people of all backgrounds: During Ottoman times, the Mawlawīyah produced a number of notable poets and musicians such as Sheikh Ghalib, Ismail Rusuhi Dede of Ankara, Esrar Dede, Halet Efendi, and Gavsi Dede who are all buried at the Galata Mawlawī Ḫāna (Turkish: Mevlevi-Hane) in Istanbul.Web Page Under Construction Music, especially the ney, play an important part in the Mawlawīyah and thus much of the traditional oriental music that Westerners associate with Turkey originates with the Mawlawī order. With the foundation of the modern secular republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk removed religion from the sphere of public policy and restricted it exclusively to that of personal morals, behavior, and faith. On 13 December 1925, a law was passed closing all the tekkes (dervish lodges) and zāwīyas (chief dervish lodges) and also the centers of veneration to which pilgrimages (zīyārat) were made. Istanbul alone had more than 250 tekkes as well as small centers for the gatherings of various fraternities. This law dissolved the Orders, prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to these titles, impounded their assets, banned their ceremonies and meetings; the law also provided penalties for those who tried to re-establish them. Two years later, in 1927, the Mausoleum of Mevlana in Konya was allowed to reopen as a Museum.Mango, Andrew, Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey, (2002), ISBN 1585670111 In the 1950s, the Turkish government began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform annually in Konya on the Urs of Mawlānā, December 17, the anniversary of Rumi's death.Kloosterman Genealogy, Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi In 1974, they were allowed to come to the West. The Mawlānā annual festival is held every year in Konya in December. It lasts two weeks and its culminating point is the 17th December called Šabe Arūz (meaning nuptial night in Persian), the night of the union of Rumi with God. Upon a proposal by Culture and Tourism Ministry of Turkey & Ministry of Culture & Islamic Guidance Of Iran, the year 2007 was proposed as the "International Rumi Year" to UNESCO, but has not yet been confirmed. This is intended for the commemoration of Rumi's 800th birthday anniversary and will be celebrated all over the world.Today'S Zaman On this occasion Iranian musician Shahram Nazeri was awarded Légion d'honneur and Iran's House of Music Award for his renowned works on Rumi masterpieces.Iran Daily - Arts & Culture - 10/03/06 2006 was declared as the "International Mozart Year" by UNESCO.CHN | News.Podcast Interview with Coleman Barks on Rumi In honour of Jalal-ud-Din Balkhi-Rumi, one of the great humanists, philosophers and poets who belong to humanity in its entirety, UNESCO issued a UNESCO Medal in his name in association with the 800th anniversary of his birth in 2007 in the hope that this medal will prove an encouragement to those who are engaged in a deep and scholarly dissemination of his ideas and ideals, which in turn would in fact enhance the diffusion of the ideals of UNESCO.http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001473/147319e.pdfhttp://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2690/pdf/i12.pdf The idea that Rumi cared little for orthodox Islam has been put forward by translations of poems attributed to him which were actually not composed by him. Some writers have even claimed or suggested that Rumi was not really a Muslim, because they believed that the line, "na tarsâ na yahûd-am man na gabr-am na musalmân-am" ("I am not a Christian, a Jew, a Zoroastrian, or a Muslim") expressed Rumi's true attitude toward Islam. However, this poem is not in the earliest manuscripts and probably is not a genuine Rumi poem. R. A. Nicholson first published a translation of this line in 1898, but he admitted that, "The original text does not occur in any of the editions or MSS used by me" (p. 281) Furthermore, the line can also be translated as "do not fear, I am not Jewish, not Zoroastrian, not Muslim", therefore again alluding to the main central theme of all Rumi's poetry, which is the enlightened being that has transcended beyond religions into the complete man. Rumi's actual approach to Islam is clarified by the following quatrain composed by him: In an article entitled "Rumi and the Sufi Tradition," professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr states:  Mawlana Jalal-ud-Dine Balkhi-Rumi is one of the greatest spiritual masters and mystic poets of Islamic civilization. In Afghanistan, he is known as ‘Mawlana’, in Iran as ‘Mawlawi’ and in Turkey, he is known as ‘Mevlana’. To honour the greatness of Mawlana, his work, vision and philosophy that are in conformity with the objectives and mission of UNESCO “constructing in the minds of men the defences of peace”, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will be associated with the celebration of Mawlana’s eight hundred years of birth in 2007, as proposed by the Permanent Delegations of Afghanistan, Egypt and Turkey and approved by the Executive Board and the General Conference of UNESCO. The Afghan Ministry of Culture & Youth has recently established a national committee to organize an international seminar to celebrate the birth and life of the great ethical philosopher and world’s renowned poet.This grand gathering of the world’s intellectuals, diplomats and followers of Maulana will be held in Kabul and possibly in Balkh (the birth place of Mawlana Jalalud-Din Balkhi).Ministry of Foreign Affairs Afghanistan - Rumi's 800 Anniversary A day of commemoration is organized at UNESCO on 6 September 2007 to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the birth of Mawlana Jalal-ud-Din Balkhi-Rumi, one of the greatest poets, philosophers and scholars of the eastern civilization.800th Anniversary of the Birth of Mawlana Jalal-ud-Din Balkhi-Rumi On September 30, 2007, Iranian school bells were rung throughout the country in honor of Mowlana.همشهری آنلاینOn the occasion of Rumi's birthday, Iran hold Iran’s Rumi week from October 26 until November 2.

The painting took two months to complete in the U.S. and was unveiled at the Farshchian Art and Cultural Complex in Isfahan on August 2, 2007. Farshchian’s work “Shams and Rumi,” has been inspired by one of Rumi’s poems. Special colors have been used in the painting to feature the mystical and spiritual relationship that existed between Shams and Rumi.      On-line texts & translations of Rumi On Rumi       simple:Mowlana Rumi a. Transliteration of the Arabic alphabet into English varies. One common transliteration is Mowlana Jalaluddin Rumi. The usual brief reference to him is simply Rumi or Balkhi. His given name Jalāl-ad-Dīn Muhammad literally means "Majesty of Religion". The Turkish spelling is Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi. Rumi's major work is Maṭnawīye Ma'nawī ("Spiritual Couplets";  - Maṣnawīye Ma'nawī), a six-volume poem regarded by many Sufis as second in importance only to the Qur'an.  It is considered by many to be one of the greatest works of mystical poetry. Rumi's other major work is the  Dīwān-e Kabīr ("Great Work") or  Dīwān-e Šams-e Tabrīzī ("The Works of Shams of Tabriz";  - named in honor of Rumi's great friend and inspiration, the dervish Shams), comprising some 40,000 verses. Several reasons have been offered for Rumi's decision to name his masterpiece after Shams. Some argue that since Rumi would not have been a poet without Shams, it is apt that the collection be named after him. Fihi Ma Fihi ("In It What's in It") provides a record of seventy-one talks and lectures given by Rumi on various occasions to his disciple.  It was complied from the notes of his various disciples, so Rumi did not author the work directly.Franklin Lewis, Rumi Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2000. Chp7  The English translation from Persian was first provided by A.J. Arberry as Discourses of Rumi(New York: Samuel Weiser, 1972) and the second book by Wheeler Thackston, Sign of the Unseen(Putney, VT: Threshold Books, 1994). Majālese Sab'a ("Seven Sessions") contains seven Persian sermons (as the name implies) or lectures given in seven different assemblies.  The sermons themselves gives a commentary on the deeper meaning of Quran and Hadeeth.  The sermons include also quotations from poems of Sana'i, Attar and other poets, including Rumi himself.  As Aflakī relates, after Šams-e Tabrīzī, Rumi gave sermons at the request of notables, especially Salāh al-Dīn Zarqūbī.Franklin Lewis, "Rumi--Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings, and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi," 2000 Maktubāt ("The Letters") is the book containing Rumi's letter in Persian Language to his disciples, family members and the men of state and influence.  The letters testify that Rumi kept very busy helping family members and administering a community of disciples that had gown up around them.
