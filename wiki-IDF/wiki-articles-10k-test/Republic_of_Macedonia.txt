        The Republic of Macedonia (,  Britannica, Macedonia, Retrieved on 2007-06-18.) , often referred to as Macedonia, is a landlocked  country on the Balkan peninsula in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Serbia and its partially recognized breakaway province of Kosovo to the north, Albania to the west, Greece to the south, and Bulgaria to the east. It was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 under the provisional reference former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROMUN Resolutions #817 of April 7 and #845 of June 18 of 1993The term FYROM is officially used by international organizations, such as the EU, NATO and the WTO), pending resolution of a naming dispute with Greece.United Nations Resolution 225 (1993) Many other international institutions and countries have recognised the country under the same reference, although a large number of countries recognise it under its preferred name as the Republic of Macedonia.See lists at Macedonia naming dispute The Republic of Macedonia forms approximately 35.8% of  the land and 40.9% of the population of the wider geographical region of Macedonia. The capital is Skopje, with 500,000 inhabitants, and there are a number of smaller cities, notably Bitola, Kumanovo, Prilep, Tetovo, Ohrid, Veles, Štip, Kočani, Gostivar and Strumica. It has more than 50 natural and artificial lakes and sixteen mountains higher than 2,000 meters (6,550&nbsp;) above sea level. The country is a member of the UN  and the Council of Europe and a member of La Francophonie, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Since December 2005 it is also a candidate for joining the European Union and has applied for NATO membership. The lands governed by the Republic of Macedonia were previously the southernmost part of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. Its current borders were fixed shortly after World War II when the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia declared the People's Republic of Macedonia as a separate nation within Yugoslavia. Over the centuries the territory which today forms the Republic of Macedonia was ruled by a number of different states and former empires. The first recorded states on this territory was the Thraco-Illyrian kingdom of Paionia, originally including the whole Axius River valley and the surrounding areas.Encyclopaedia Britannica - Paeonia. [ ] The kingdom of Macedon took over Paionia in 336 BC and conquered the southern border regions, as well as Pelagonia under Philip II of Macedon.Macedonian Center for Archaeological Research. The Ancient Kingdom of Macedonia in the Republic of Macedonia. [ ] The kingdom of Paionia was reduced to a semi-autonomous, subordinated status.Encyclopaedia Britannica - 1911 Edition. Paeonia. [ ] Philip's son Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) managed to briefly extend Macedon's power over Paeonia but the native dynasty however, continued to be highly respected. In 280 BC the Gallic invaders  ravaged the land of the Paeonians, who, being further hard pressed by the Dardani, joined the Macedonians. Generally, however, the Paeonians continued to live autonomously until the coming of the Romans on the Balkans. Subsequently the territory became part of two Roman provinces. The greater part of it was within Macedonia Salutaris, but the northern border regions- inhabited by the Dardani- became a part of Moesia Superior. Encyclopaedia Britannica - Scopje. [ ] By 400 AD, however, the Paeonians had lost their identity, and Paionia was merely a geographic term. One of the most significant archeological remnant of Macedon are the ruins of Heraclea Lyncestis founded by Philip II of Macedon near what is now Bitola.  In the late 6th century AD, Byzantine control over the area disintegrated, and the region was invaded by a succession of Slavic tribes from the north, pushing out some existing populations, while many others were assimilated. These included Greek, Latin, Illyrian and Thracian-speaking inhabitants in the regions of today's Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria.  The Slavic invaders of Byzantine Macedonia organised themselves in autonomous rural societies called by the Greeks "Σκλαβινίαι" (Sklaviniai). They laid various sieges to Byzantine lands, conquering virtually all of Greece except for some major cities such as Thessaloniki and Athens. They continued to occupy the entire Balkans, including all of Macedonia, Thrace, Moesia, and even most of Greece proper.South-eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250 - Florin Curta The Byzantine emperors would aim to Hellenise and incorporate the Sklaviniai into the socio-economic rule of Byzantium. While Byzantine achieved this with the Slavs of the Thracian theme, the emperors had to resort to military expeditions to pacify the Sklaviniai of Macedonia, often repeatedly. These expeditions reached their peak with Justinian II, who is said to have removed as many as 200,000 from Macedonia to central Anatolia, forcing them to pay tribute and serve in the imperial army. Whilst many of the Slavs in Macedonia had to acknowledge Byzantine authority, the majority remained ethnically independent, and continued to form the demographic majority in the region as a whole. With the growth of the First Bulgarian Empire, all these regions and their people were incorporated into the empire, cementing the Slavic character of the entire region.   The Slavic tribes in today's region of Republic of Macedonia (then part of the medieval state of Bulgaria) accepted Christianity as their own religion around the 9th century, during the reign of prince Boris I of Bulgaria. The creators of the Glagolitic alphabet, the Byzantine Greek monks Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius, under the guidance of the Patriarchate at Constantinople, were promoters of Christianity and initiated Slavic literacy among the Slavic people. They were based in Thessaloniki, where Slavic was spoken universally as a second language after Greek. Their work was accepted in early medieval Bulgaria and continued by St. Clement of Ohrid, creator of Cyrillic alphabet and St. Naum of Ohrid as founders of the Ohrid Literary School. Emperor Basil II defeated the armies of Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria and by 1018 the region had been mostly subjugated by the Byzantines. The Byzantines resumed full control of the Balkans by the early 11th century, but by the late 12th century Byzantine decline brought about the birth of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The empire soon met with political difficulties, and in 13th century the wider geographical Macedonia region fell once again under Byzantine control. In the 14th century, it became part of the Serbian Empire, who saw themselves as liberators of Slavic kin from the despotism of Byzantine, and culture and Christianity flourished once again. Skopje became the capital of Czar Stefan Dusan's empire. However, with his death, his weak successor and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. This coincided with the entry of the Ottoman Empire into Europe. With no major Balkan power left to defend Christianity, the entire Balkans fell to Turkish rule, which would remain so for five centuries. Ottoman rule over the region was considered harsh. One of the earliest uprisings against Ottoman rule came in 1689 with Karposh's Rebellion. Several movements whose goals were the establishment of autonomous Macedonia, encompassing the entire region of Macedonia, began to arise in the late 1800s; the earliest of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, later transformed to SMORO. In 1905 it was renamed as IMORO and after World War I the organization separated into the IMRO and the ITRO. The early organization did not proclaim any ethnic identities; it was officially open to "...uniting all the disgruntled elements in Macedonia and the Adrianople region, regardless of their nationality...".M. Glenny, "The Balkans" The majority of its members were however Slavic/Bulgarian-speakers. In 1903, IMRO organised the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans, which after some initial successes, including the forming of the Krushevo Republic, was crushed with much loss of life. The uprising and the forming of the Krushevo Republic are considered the cornerstone and precursors to the eventual establishment of the Republic of Macedonia. Following the two Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, most of its European held territories were divided between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. The territory of the present-day Republic of Macedonia was then named , "Southern Serbia". After the First World War, Serbia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1929, the Kingdom was officially renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and divided into provinces called banovinas. So-called "Southern Serbia" (Vardar Macedonia), including all of what is now the Republic of Macedonia, became known as the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by the Axis Powers and the Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italian-occupied Albania. Local recruits and volunteers formed the Bulgarian 5th Army, based in Skopje, which was responsible for the round-up and deportation of over 7,000 Jews in Skopje and Bitola. Harsh rule by the occupying forces encouraged some to support the Communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito. After the end of the Second World War, when Tito became Yugoslavia's president, the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was established. The People's Republic of Macedonia became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation. Following the federation's renaming as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963, the People's Republic of Macedonia was likewise renamed, becoming the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. It dropped the "Socialist" from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia. The country officially celebrates September 8, 1991 as Independence day (Ден на независноста, Den na nezavisnosta), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia, albeit legalising participation in future union of the former states of Yugoslavia. The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising (St. Elijah's Day) on August 2 is also widely celebrated on an official level. Robert Badinter as a head of Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on the former Yugoslavia recommended EU recognition in January 1992 [ ]. The Republic of Macedonia remained at peace through the Yugoslav wars of the early 1990s. A few very minor changes to its border with Yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries. However, it was seriously destabilised by the Kosovo War in 1999, when an estimated 360,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country. Although they departed shortly after the war, soon after, Albanian radicals on both sides of the border took up arms in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Albanian-populated areas of the Republic. A short conflict was fought between government and ethnic Albanian rebels, mostly in the north and west of the country, between March and June 2001. This war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire monitoring force. In the Ohrid Agreement, the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority. The Albanian side agreed to surrender separatist demands and to fully recognise all Macedonian institutions. In addition, according to this accord, the NLA were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force. In 2005, the country was officially recognised as a European Union candidate state, under the reference "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".   The Republic of Macedonia is a parliamentary democracy with an executive government composed of a coalition of parties from the unicameral legislature () and an independent judicial branch with a constitutional court. The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the President of the Government.  The President is the commander-in-chief of the state armed forces and a president of the state Security Council. The President of the Republic is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most. The current President is Branko Crvenkovski. With the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities (; singular: ). The capital, Skopje, is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the "City of Skopje".  Municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia are units of local self-government.  Neighbouring municipalities may establish co-operative arrangements. Judiciary power is exercised by courts, with the court system being headed by the Judicial Supreme Court, Constitutional Court and the Republican Judicial Council. The assembly appoints the judges. The country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically-based political parties representing the country's ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001, following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, the Republic's parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate. After a troublesome pre-election campaign, the country saw a relatively calm and democratic change of government in the elections held on 5 July 2006. The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre-right party VMRO-DPMNE led by Nikola Gruevski. Gruevski's decision to include the Democratic Party of Albanians in the new government, instead of the Democratic Union for Integration - Party for Democratic Prosperity coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes, triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population (the coalition between these two parties is recently broken [ ]).  However, recently a dialogue was established between the Democratic Union for Integration and the ruling VMRO-DMPNE party as an effort to talk about the disputes between the two parties and to support European and NATO aspirations of the country. [ ].  Recently ranked as the fourth 'best reformatory state' out of 178 countries ranked by the World Bank, the Republic of Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence.http://www.worldbank.org  The country has developed an open economy with trade accounting for more than 90% of GDP in recent years. Since 1996, the country has witnessed steady, though slow, economic growth with GDP growing by 3.1% in 2005. This figure is projected to rise to an average of 5.2% in the 2006-2010 period.http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mkd_aag.pdf  The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation, with an inflation rate of only 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2007http://www.worldbank.org and has implemented policies focused on attracting foreign investment and promoting the development of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).  The current government introduced a flat tax system with the intention of making the country more attractive to foreign investment. The flat tax rate was 12% in 2007 and will be further lowered to 10% in 2008. http://www.vlada.mk/english/News/December2006/ei8-12-2006.htmhttp://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/macedonias-new-flat-tax-51002.aspx Despite these successes, as of 2005 Macedonia's unemployment rate was 37.2%http://www.worldbank.org.mkand as of 2006 its poverty rate was 22%.http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mkd_aag.pdf  Corruption and a relatively ineffective legal system also act as significant restraints on successful economic development. The Republic still has one of the lowest per capita GDPs in Europe. Furthermore, the country's grey market is estimated at close to 20% of GDP.The 2006 CIA Factbook [ ] In terms of structure, as of 2005 the service sector constituted by far the largest part of GDP at 57.1%, up from 54.2% in 2000.  The industrial sector represents 29.3% of GDP, down from 33.7% in 2000 while agriculture represents only 12.9%, up from 12%.http://devdata.worldbank.org  Textiles represent the most significant sector for trade, accounting for more than half of total exports.http://www.macedonianembassy.org.uk/economy.html  Other important exports include iron, steel, wine and vegetables.Republic of Macedonia.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [ ]. The Republic of Macedonia, together with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, belonged to the less developed region of the former Yugoslavia. It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav internal market collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended. In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist East European countries during the transition to a market economy. Its main land and rail exports route, through Serbia, remains unreliable with high transit costs, thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable, early vegetables market to Germany. The outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro caused great damage to the Republic's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets prior to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. When Greece imposed a trade embargo on the Republic in 1994–95, the economy was also affected. Some relief was afforded by the end of the Bosnian war in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation. Since the end of the Greek embargo, Greece has become the most important business partner of the Republic of Macedonia. Many Greek companies have bought former state companies in the country, such as the oil refinery Okta, the baking company Zhito Luks, a marble mine in Prilep, textile facilities in Bitola etc. Other key partners are Germany, Italy and Slovenia.    The Republic of Macedonia under the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.) is a member of a number of international organisations such as the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, associate member of La Francophonie, World Trade Organization (WTO) etc.  It is seeking to join NATO and the European Union, although its accession to either is unlikely to occur before 2008 and 2012, respectively. In December 2005, the leaders of the EU formally named it as a candidate country but did not set a date for starting entry talks. The Macedonia Connects project, funded by USAID, makes this country the first all broadband wireless country (its size or larger) in the world. Project begins October 1st, 2004 and closes on the 30th September 2007. During that period of time 460 schools (100 High Schools and 360 Primary Schools) are connected to the Internet. The price for Internet connectivity drops while the uptake of Internet access increases steadily from 4% to 34% in 3 years. The government of Macedonia agrees to purchase 180,000 computers in August, 2007.http://www.mkconnects.org.mk/new/dynamicpage.php?id=000049 The Republic of Macedonia is represented abroad by embassies in the following countries: Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, People's Republic of China, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, and the Vatican. The Republic of Macedonia also maintains consulates or representative offices in Pristina, Serbia; Thessaloniki, Greece; Toronto, Canada; Detroit, USA; Istanbul, Turkey and Podgorica, Montenegro. There are also permanent missions at the UN, NATO, EU, UNESCO, Council of Europe, and FAO headquarters. There is currently no representation in Taiwan (Republic of China) since 2001 when diplomatic relations were formally severed between the two countries and the Macedonian embassy in Beijing was reopened. The Republic of Macedonia generally has good relations with Greece and enjoys substantial inward investment from Greece. However, the naming dispute has inhibited the establishment of full diplomatic relations so far but has not prevented Greece and the Republic from engaging in military and security co-operation, cross-border investments, and cultural exchanges. The November 2005 European Commission report states that, "Relations with Greece have improved in the last few years. Greece is the most important investor in the country (57% of the total foreign investments) and trade has been constantly increasing." For the official position of the Hellenic Republic on its trade relations with the Republic, and on the name issue, see [ ] and [ ] The November 2006 European Commission report states that, [ ], "In December 2005 the two countries opened an Office for Consular, Economic and Trade Relations in Bitola and a Consulate in Thessaloniki respectively. Co-operation has developed in many areas, including transport, health, security, culture and customs. However, there has been no progress on the name issue which remains an open problem. Renewed efforts are needed, with a constructive approach, to find a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution on the name issue with Greece, under the auspices of the UN, within the framework of UN Security Council Resolutions (EEC) No 817/93 and (EEC) No 845/93, thereby contributing to regional co-operation and good neighbourly relations." Former Greek foreign minister, M. Papakonstandinou, clearly expressed Athens' position towards the republic, "Greek interests demand that this state survives. It must exist [...]  This is the  firm position of [both ND and PASOK]."  (ref: Interview with the minister. In, 'Andi' (weekly socio-political journal), Nr 588, 13 October 1995). According to the latest Greek census held in 2001, there are 962 holders of citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia in Greece [ ], although it should be noted that Greek census, like the censuses of some other EU member states (Italy, Spain, Denmark, France etc.), do not take into account the ethnicity of the inhabitants of the country and that immigration has significantly increased since then. According to a study conducted for the Hellenic Migration Policy Institute (ΙΜΕΠΟ, IMEPO), in 2003 90,651 visa applications were made by citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, out of which 90,549 were granted and 102 rejected [ ].   After the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Macedonia's name and history became the object of a dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia Floudas, Demetrius Andreas;    (see also Vergina Sun). From 1992 to 1995, the two countries also engaged in a dispute over the Republic's first flag, which incorporated the Vergina Sun symbol, a presumed symbol of the ancient Kingdom of Macedon. Its adoption by the Republic, on 3 July 1992, was seen as a reaction by Skopje to Athens' pressure to change the name. This aspect of the dispute was resolved when the flag was changed under the terms of an interim accord agreed between the two states in October 1995. Even when the European Union-nominated Arbitration Commission (consisting of the five presidents of constitutional courts - German, French, Italian, Spanish and Belgian) has handed down its opinion that "that the use of the name `Macedonia' cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State",[ ] Greece objected the use of the term Macedonia in the newly sovereign state and resorted to disputing its use. Floudas, Demetrius Andreas;    Due to the dispute over the name, the United Nations agreed to a provisional reference — "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" () — when it became a member state in 1993 [ ]. Most international organisations adopted the same convention, including the European Union, NATO, the International Monetary Fund, the European Broadcasting Union, and the International Olympic Committee, among others. The EU recognises the country as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the negotiations with the EU are held using this reference [ ], [ ]. The same reference is also used in any discussion to which Greece is a party [ ] but is inconsistently used by other countries. On the other hand, the government of the Republic of Macedonia never signs any documents with a name different than the constitutional name.[ ] However, an increasing number of countries have abandoned the United Nations provisional reference and have recognised the country as the Republic of Macedonia or simply Macedonia instead.  These include four of the five permanent UN Security Council members, the United States, Russia, United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, as well two of its immediate neighbours, Bulgaria and Serbia. Negotiations continue between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia but have yet to reach any settlement of the dispute. The Republic of Macedonia maintains uneven relations with the Republic of Bulgaria. Bulgaria was the first country to recognise Macedonian independence and the republic under its constitutional name. Many Macedonian students matriculate in Bulgarian universities. Bulgaria supports the Macedonian bid to enter the EU and NATO. It also donated a large amount of tanks, artillery and other materials to the Macedonian army. According to Bulgarian media and international minority rights NGOs, there have been repeated cases of anti-Bulgarian violence towards citizens with a Bulgarian national background and desecrations [ ]. A number of independent international organisations maintain that Macedonia is actively conducting propaganda against Bulgaria (the police being indifferent in this respect), and that Skopje maintains a harsh attitude towards its citizens with a Bulgarian background.[ ] Issues have also been raised over appropriation and falsification of Bulgarian history by authors with Macedonian nationalistic agenda, and the treatment in the Republic of Macedonia of people espousing a Bulgarian national identity. The organization of the Bulgarian minority in the Republic of Macedonia Radko for example (which was later banned by the Macedonian Constitutional Court in violation of International Treaties in this respect) had been publicly harassed after they claimed that there is no Macedonian ethnicity today, and the perpetrators were acclaimed as heroes by the media. [ ] In the Republic of Macedonia, there is a persistent intimidation and beating of people with a Bulgarian ethnic identity, as it is reported by minority rights NGOs [ ] Bulgaria is also concerned at repeated territorial claims against it, backed by the Skopje authorities; for instance, according to the new Macedonian encyclopaedia (funded by the Ministry of Culture), some parts of Bulgaria are represented in Macedonia. [ ] Another point of contention in the relationship between the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria is the latter's refusal to recognise the existence of a separate Macedonian ethnicity, instead considering Macedonians to be Bulgarians and their language as a regional "norm" based on local Bulgarian dialects [ ]. The so-called "language dispute", which started in 1993 and was effectively impeding diplomatic relations, was resolved in 1999 when the two governments adopted the formula "the official language in the Republic of Macedonia, and the official language in Bulgaria" in their bilateral agreements where they use the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages. Similarly, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court has banned the political party of the ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria UMO Ilinden-Pirin as separatist; this measure was found not to be "proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued" on October 20 2005 by the European Court of Human Rights.   The EU leaders on the meeting held in Thessaloniki in 2003 [ ] promised western Balkan countries that they will become an integral part of the EU, once they meet the established criteria.  As part of the ongoing efforts to expand its membership, the European Union (EU) granted the Republic of Macedonia candidate status on 17 December 2005, but with no promise of when such negotiations could start.  France had made a budget deal as a condition for granting  the Republic of Macedonia candidate status and Greece agreed not to veto the decision on the premise that the name dispute will be resolved.   The Republic of Macedonia  applied for full membership on 22 March 2004. Vlado Bučkovski, then minister of defence and later prime minister, hailed the decision as a "one-way ticket" to the EU for his country. The country is still included in the black visa list of the EU [ ]. According to the EU, namely in accordance with its Copenhagen criteria, the main obstacles towards eventual EU membership for Republic of Macedonia concern good relations with  neighbouring countries and reforms to its judicial and police systems. Also, growth rate lags behind that of most EU members, unemployment is high and foreign investment is relatively low.  The decentralisation process imposed after the six-month conflict in 2001 still requires full implementation. In principle, the relatively low population and European characteristics of the Republic promise few strains on the EU budget. At a press conference held in March 2006, German chancellor Angela Merkel suggested a privileged partnership for potential members. Following the rejection of the EU constitution by the French and Dutch voters, the EU is in a period of reflection (time to decide what to do next) that can last for several years. This decision seems to delay the prospect of EU membership for candidates like Croatia,  the Republic of Macedonia  and Turkey for some period. The French have warned that they want strict application of the notion of absorption capacity for the EU - a concept which has existed since 1993 but which has rarely been highlighted. Another problem in the relations between the EU and the Republic of Macedonia is the EU visa regime with the country, fostering resentment and inhibiting progress on trade, business, education etc., contributing negatively to regional stability. [ ]. In February 2006, the Republic became the fourth member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), joining Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. CEFTA acts as 'sandbox' to encourage joint efforts for the integration of participating countries in Western European institutions and look for opportunities for close economic and political co-operation. The naming dispute with Greece remains an unresolved issue in the country's accession to the EU. On August 29, 2006, the Greek foreign minister, Ms. Dora Bakoyannis, affirmed that "...the Hellenic Parliament, under any composition, will not ratify the accession of the neighbouring country to the EU and NATO if the name issue is not resolved beforehand." More recently, EU reports have confirmed that the Republic of Macedonia's hope of starting accession talks next year cannot succeed. The reasons outlined by a report of the European Commission call for progress on the rule of law and fighting organised crime and corruption before entry talks could start. EU officials also lament the absence of dialogue with the Albanian community, the politicisation of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms. It also called for a resolution over the name issue with Greece. Non-EU reports point the finger at prime minister Nikola Gruevski for having shut out the former Yugoslav republic's ethnic Albanian minority and for having politicised many state institutions.   In August 2004, the Republic of Macedonia was reorganised into 85 municipalities (; sing. ), 10 of which comprise Greater Skopje. This is reduced from the previous 123 municipalities established in September, 1996.  Prior to this, local government was organised into 34 administrative districts.   Macedonia's statistical regions exist solely for legal and statistical purposes. The regions are:   The Republic of Macedonia is a landlocked country that is geographically clearly defined by a central valley formed by the Vardar river and framed along its borders by mountain ranges. The Republic's terrain is mostly rugged, located between the Šara and Osogovo, which frame the valley of the Vardar river.  Three large lakes — Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa and Dojran Lake — lie on the southern borders of the Republic, bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece. Ohrid is considered to be one of the oldest lakes and biotopes in the world [ ]. The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past, most recently in 1963 when Skopje was heavily damaged by a major earthquake, killing over 1,000. The Republic of Macedonia also has scenic mountains. They belong to two different ranges: Dinarska and Rodopska. The Dinarska range is the oldest with subsequent erosion; the Rodopska range is younger offering rugged, alpine scenery. The ten highest mountains in the Republic of Macedonia are:  The Republic of Macedonia has transitional climate from Mediterranean to continental.  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are moderately cold.  Average annual precipitation varies from 1,700 mm (67 inches) in the western mountainous area to 500 mm (20 inches) in the eastern area.   There are three main climatic zones in the country: temperate Mediterranean, mountainous and mildly Continental.  Along the valleys of the Vardar and Strumica rivers, in the regions of Gevgelija, Valandovo, Dojran, Strumica and Radovish the climate is temperate Mediterranean. The warmest region is the Demir Kapija and Gevgelija region, where the temperature in July and August frequently exceeds 40 C.  The mountainous climate is present in the mountainous regions of the country and it is characterised by long and snowy winters and short and cold summers. The spring is colder than the fall.  The majority of the country has a moderate continental climate with warm and dry summers and relatively cold and wet winters.  There are 30 main and regular weather stations in the country. The Republic of Macedonia has an estimated population of 2,055,915[ ] citizens, according to the last population census in 2002 with 58% of the population living in urban areas. Following is a list of the largest Macedonian cities according to the 1994 census data as more recent census does not list city populations [ ] and municipalities according to the 2002 census data: [ ]  The largest ethnic group in the country are the ethnic Macedonians. According to the 2002 census,http://www.stat.gov.mk/pdf/kniga_13.pdf 1,297,981 inhabitants declared themselves to be Macedonians, representing 64.18% of the total population. Approximately 500,000 inhabitants are declared as Albanians, representing 25.2% of the population.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html Smaller ethnic minorities include Turks (77,959 or 3.85%), Roma (53,879 or 2.66%), Serbs (35,939 or 1.78%), Bosniaks (17,018 or 0.84%), Vlachs (9,695 or 0.48%), and other (20,993 or 1.04%). The Macedonian national census records most ethnic groups, but the smaller ones, such as Bulgarians and Greeks, are not enumerated separately in the final report. The demographic table, according to the 2002 population census. A wide variety of languages are spoken in the Republic of Macedonia, reflecting its ethnic diversity. The official and most widely spoken language is Macedonian, which belongs to the Eastern branch of the South Slavic language group. Structurally, it is closer to Bulgarian than any other Slavonic language. Its current form was codified after World War II and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition. Other languages including Albanian, Bulgarian, Romani, Turkish, Serbian, Vlach (Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian), Circassian, Greek and others are spoken roughly in proportion with their associated ethnic groups. Macedonian is the only language explicitly designated as an official national language in the constitution. It also provides however that languages spoken by over 20% of the total population are also official - at present, only Albanian fulfills this requirement. Additionally, in municipalities where at least 20% of the population is from other ethnic minorities, their individual languages are used for official purposes in local government. The majority (64.7%) of the population belongs to the Macedonian Orthodox Church (which declared autocephaly in 1968, that is still not recognised by the Serbian and other Eastern Orthodox Churches, although the Archbishop's Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church, with Decision No. 06/1959, has recognised the autonomy of the Macedonian Orthodox Church [ ] ). Muslims comprise 33.3% of the population and other Christian denominations comprise 0.37%. The remainder (1.63%) is recorded as "unspecified" in the 2002 national census [ ]. Most of the native Albanians, Turks and Bosniaks are Muslims, as are a minority of the country's ethnic Macedonian population, known as Macedonian Muslims. Altogether, there are more than 1200 churches and 400 mosques in the country.  The Orthodox and Islamic religious communities have secondary religion schools in Skopje.  There is an Orthodox theological college in the capital. Macedonia has the largest proportion of Muslims of any country in Europe after Turkey, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Macedonian Orthodox Church is the dominant church in the country.  It has 10 provinces (seven in the country and three abroad), 10 bishops, and about 350 priests. Macedonians, who are the majority of the population, are Christian Orthodox. A total of 30,000 people are baptised in all the provinces every year. The church has issues with the Serbian Orthodox Church after the separation and self-declaration of autocephaly (not recognised by any other Orthodox church) in 1967. However, the Archbishop's Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church, with Decision No. 06/1959, has recognised the autonomy (self-dependence) of the Macedonian Orthodox Church).  After the negotiations between the two churches were suspended, the Serbian Orthodox Church recognised a group led by Zoran Vranishkovski (also known as Archbishop Jovan of Ohrid, a former Macedonian church bishop, as the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric. The reaction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church was to cut off all relations with the clergy of the Ohrid Archbishopric and to prevent bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church from entering the Republic of Macedonia. Bishop Jovan was jailed for 18 months for "defaming the Macedonian Orthodox church and harming the religious feelings of local citizens" by distributing Serbian Orthodox church calendars and pamphlets. [ ]. The Macedonian State Religion Commission denies the group to be registered as a religious group saying that only one group may be registered for each confession and that the name was not sufficiently distinct from that of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.  The Macedonian church had acquired documents confirming direct involvement of the Serbian government in financing the activities of the group, seen as interference in the internal affairs of another sovereign state by the Macedonian President Crvenkovski. [ ]. The Macedonian President also rejected the request of the Head of the Serbian Orthodox Church for abolition of Zoran Vranishkovski (set as a main condition for resumption of negotiations between two churches by the Serbian Patriarch).  Vranishkovski is convicted of misappropriate usage of a large sum of money donated to the Macedonian Orthodox Church. [ ] The Macedonian Byzantine Catholic Church (also known as the  Macedonian Greek Catholic Church) has approximately 11,000 adherents in the Republic. The Church was established in 1918, and is made up mostly of converts to Catholicism and their descendants. The Church is of the Byzantine Rite and is in communion with the Roman and Eastern Catholic Churches.  Its liturgical worship is performed in Macedonian.  The Jewish community of the Republic of Macedonia, which numbered some 7,200 people on the eve of World War II, was almost entirely destroyed during the War, with only 2%http://www.balkanalysis.com/2007/03/14/macedonia%E2%80%99s-jewish-community-commemorates-the-holocaust-and-embraces-the-future/ of Macedonian Jews surviving the Holocaust. After their liberation and the end of the War, most opted to emigrate to Israel. Today, the country's Jewish community numbers approximately 200 persons, almost all of whom live in Skopje. Most Macedonian Jews are Sephardic - the descendants of 15th century refugees who had fled the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. There is a small Protestant community. The most famous Protestant in the country is the former president Boris Trajkovski.  He was from the Methodist Community, which is the largest and oldest Protestant Church in the Republic, dating back to the late nineteenth century.  Since the 1980s the small Protestant community has grown, partly through new confidence and partly with outside missionary help. The Macedonian education system consists of: The higher levels of education can be obtained at one of the four state universities: Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola, State University of Tetovo and Goce Delchev University of Shtip. There is a number of private university institutions, such as the European University [ ], Slavic University in Sveti Nikole, the South East European University and others. The United States Agency for International Development has underwritten a project called "Macedonia Connects" which has made the Republic of Macedonia the first all-broadband wireless country in the world [ ]. The Ministry of Education and Sciences reports that 461 schools (primary and secondary) are now connected to the internet. In addition, an Internet Service Provider (On.net), has created a MESH Network to provide WIFI services in the 11 largest cities/towns in the country.    The Republic of Macedonia has a rich cultural heritage in art, architecture, poetry, and music. It has many ancient, protected religious sites. Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held annually. Macedonian music styles developed under the strong influence of Byzantine church music. The Republic of Macedonia is amongst one of the countries with the most beautiful preserved Byzantine fresco paintings, mainly from the period between the 11th and 16th centuries. There are several thousands square metres of fresco painting preserved, the major part of which is in very good condition and represent masterworks of the Macedonian School of ecclesiastical painting. In the Republic of Macedonia the past meets the present. Its age-old architecture and monasteries and churches of exquisite beauty make an interesting contrast to the super modern new architecture. Most of the Macedonian monasteries, built in various periods, and particularly those built between the 11th and 15th–16th centuries, have been completely preserved until today. The Macedonian collection of icons, and in particular the Ohrid ones, are among the most valuable collections in the world today. After the Sinai and the Moscow collection of icons, it is third in importance in Orthodoxy. From a Byzantological aspect, it is unique. The most important cultural events in the country are the Ohrid Summer festival of classical music and drama, the Struga Poetry Evenings which gather poets from more than 50 countries in the world, Skopje May Opera Evenings, International Camera Festival in Bitola, Open Youth Theatre and Skopje Jazz Festival in Skopje etc. Lake Ohrid viewed from the Church of St. John at Kaneo Saint Bogorodica Precista Monastery near Kičevo National park Pelister The city of Bitola Mount Korab – The highest mountain in the country Šar mountain St. Panteleimon church near Skopje The city of Bitola The city of Ohrid located on the shores of Lake Ohrid Ancient aqueduct near Skopje  Morodvis (Crkvište - Morobisdon) archaeological site near Kocani        als:Republik Makedonien arc:ܩܘܛܢܝܘܬܐ ܕܡܩܕܘܢܝܐ roa-rup:Machedonia frp:Rèpublica de Macèdonie ast:República de Macedonia zh-min-nan:Makedonija Kiōng-hô-kok be-x-old:Рэспубліка Македонія ceb:Republika sa Macedonia dsb:Makedońska hak:Mâ-khì-tun hsb:Republika Makedonska pam:Republic of Macedonia pms:Macedònia crh:Makedoniya Cumhuriyeti rmy:Republika Makedoniya sco:Republic o Macedonie scn:Ripùbblica di Macidonia simple:Republic of Macedonia sh:Republika Makedonija udm:Респyблика Македония vec:Republica de Macedonia fiu-vro:Makõdoonia Vabariik war:Republika han Masedonya zh-yue:馬其頓共和國 bat-smg:Makedonėjė Mount Korab 2,764 m 9,396 ft Šar Mountain 2,747 m 9,012 ft Baba Mountain 2,601 m 8,533 ft Jakupica 2,540 m 8,333 ft Nidže 2,521 m 8,271 ft Deshat 2,373 m 7,785 ft Galičica 2,288 m 7,507 ft Stogovo 2,273 m 7,457 ft Jablanica 2,257 m 7,405 ft Osogovo 2,251 m 7,383 ft Mount Bistra 2,163 m 7,096 ft Plačkovica 1,754 m 5,754 ft  SKOPJE Bitola Veles Štip Strumica Tetovo Kumanovo Prilep Gostivar Ohrid Struga Kočani Radoviš SERBIA BULGARIA GREECE Largest cities in the Republic of Macedonia   Largest Macedonian cities and municipalities City Population Coatof arms Administrative division Population Skopje 444,000 Greater Skopje 506,926 Bitola 80,000 Bitola municipality 95,385 Kumanovo 71,000 Kumanovo municipality 105,484 Prilep 68,000 Prilep municipality 76,768 Tetovo 60,000 Tetovo municipality 86,580 Ohrid 51,000 Ohrid municipality 55,749 Veles 48,000 Veles municipality 55,108 Gostivar 46,000 Gostivar municipality 81,042 Štip 42,000 Štip municipality 47,796 Strumica 40,000 Strumica municipality 54,676 Kočani 27,000 Kočani municipality 38,092 Radoviš 16,223 Radoviš municipality 28,244 Number % TOTAL 2,022,547 100 Macedonians 1,297,981 64.18 Albanians 509,083 25.17 Turks 77,959 3.85 Roma people 53,879 2.66 Serbs 35,939 1.78 Vlachs 9,695 0.48 others 38,011 1.88 Skopje Pelagonia Polog Eastern Southeastern Northeastern Southwestern Vardar See also: Mountains of the Republic of Macedonia See also: List of cities in the Republic of Macedonia See also: Human rights in the Republic of Macedonia pre-school education primary education secondary education higher education A list of famous ethnic Macedonians Music of the Republic of Macedonia Macedonian language Public holidays in the Republic of Macedonia Macedonia (terminology) Ethnic Macedonians Communications in the Republic of Macedonia Foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia Military of the Republic of Macedonia Transportation in the Republic of Macedonia Socialist Republic of Macedonia Public holidays in the Republic of Macedonia Panoramas of Macedonia Macedonian Photo Gallery with over 1000 images from Republic of Macedonia Official Government website ExploringMacedonia - National Tourism Portal Business climate, researches, news and investment opportunities Macedonia In Your Pocket city guides Congressional Research Service (CRS) Reports regarding the Republic of Macedonia  :LINKNUM:497
