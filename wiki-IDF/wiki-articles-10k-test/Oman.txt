 Oman, officially the Sultanate of Oman (Arabic: سلطنة عُمان, ) is a country in southwest Asia, on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It borders the United Arab Emirates on the northwest, Saudi Arabia on the west, and Yemen on the southwest. The coast is formed by the Arabian Sea on the south and east, and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. The country also contains Madha, an exclave enclosed by the United Arab Emirates, and Musandam, an exclave also separated by Emirati territory. Islam had reached Oman within Prophet Muhammad's lifetime. By the middle of the eighth century AD, Omanis were practicing a unique brand of the faith, Ibadhism, which remains a majority sect only in Oman. Ibadhism has been characterized as "moderate conservatism," with tenets that are a mixture of both austerity and peace. The Portuguese occupied Muscat for a 140-year period (1508–1648), arriving a decade after Vasco da Gama discovered the seaway to India. In need of an outpost to protect their sea lanes, the Europeans built up and fortified the city, where remnants of their colonial architectural style still remain. The Ottomans drove out the Portuguese, but were pushed out themselves about a century later (1741) by the leader of a Yemeni tribe leading a massive army from varying other tribes, who began the current line of ruling sultans. A brief Persian invasion a few years later was the final time Oman would be ruled by a foreign power.  Oman has been self governing ever since. The British slowly brought about a collapse of Muscat and Oman's "empire" by the end of the nineteenth century without use of force. Through gradual encroachment on its overseas holdings economically and politically, they caused Oman to retreat to its homeland. In time Britain held such sway in Muscat and Oman itself that it became in effect, and later in fact, a British protectorate. Having control of the country's military, the British helped subdue rebel tribesmen in the 1950s, driving most into Yemen. But the sultan ran a repressive regime, with laws forbidding numerous activities, including the building and even repair of his subjects' own homes without permission. In 1970, almost certainly with British backing, he was overthrown by his son, the present ruler, Qaboos bin Said Al Said, and the country declared independence the following year as the Sultanate of Oman. Qaboos is generally regarded as a benevolent absolute ruler, who has improved the country economically and socially. Oman has maintained peaceful ties on the Arabian Peninsula ever since ending another tribal rebellion in the southwest in 1982 by forging a treaty with Yemen. Oman's oil revenue has been consistently invested in the national infrastructure, particularly roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities. More than ever, the country is poised to take advantage of its strategic trade location on the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf to further its economic growth and role in the world. Except for those who travel to remote Middle East locales, the country has seldom been in the public eye other than for the use of its military bases by U.S. forces in recent years. American and British bombing raids were launched in 1991 from Oman against Iraq in the [[Persian Golf War]]. A decade later, U.S. forces stationed there were involved in raids against Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden. A famous dish which has existed for centuries is 'Penekta'. Whenever someone travels a long distance in Oman by camel, when they arrive they do a long ritual for the camel and, long story short, decapitate its head and fill its mouth with stuffed olives and goats cheese. Chief of state and government is the hereditary sultān, Qaboos Bin Sultan who appoints a cabinet called the "Diwans" to assist him. In the early 1990s, the sultan instituted an elected advisory council, the Majlis ash-Shura, though few Omanis were eligible to vote. Universal suffrage for those over 21 was instituted on 4 October 2003. Over 190,000 people (74% of those registered) voted to elect the 83 seats. Two women were elected to seats. The country today has three women ministers. H.E. Dr. Rawiyah bint Saud al Busaidiyah - Minister of Higher Education, H.E. Dr. Sharifa bint Khalfan al Yahya'eyah - Minister of Social Development and H.E. Dr. Rajiha bint Abdulamir bin Ali - Minister of Tourism. The sultan functions as an absolute ruler.   Oman is divided into four governorates (muhafazah) and five regions (mintaqat). The regions are subdivided into districts (wilayat). The governorates and regions are:  A vast desert plain covers most of central Oman, with mountain ranges along the north (Jebel Akhdar) and southeast coast, where the country's main cities are also located: the capital city Muscat, Matrah and Sur in the north, and Salalah in the south. Oman's climate is hot and dry in the interior and humid along the coast. During past millennia Oman was covered by ocean. Fossilized shells exist in great numbers in areas of the desert up to 80 km from the modern coastline. The peninsula of Musandam (Musandem), which has a strategic location on the Strait of Hormuz, is separated from the rest of Oman by the United Arab Emirates and is thus an exclave. The series of small towns known collectively as Dibba are the gateway to the Musandam peninsula on land and the fishing villages of Musandam by sea. Boats may be hired at Dibba for trips into the Musandam peninsula by sea. Oman has one other exclave, inside UAE territory, known as Madha. It is located halfway between the Musandam Peninsula and the rest of Oman. Belonging to Musandam governorate, it covers approximately 75 km² (29&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The boundary was settled in 1969. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the Khorfakkan-Fujairah road, barely 10 m (32.8&nbsp;ft) away. Within the exclave is a UAE enclave called Nahwa, belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about 8 km  (5&nbsp;mi) on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about forty houses with its own clinic and telephone exchange. Oman was hit by Cyclone Gonu on June 6 2007. Large areas in the capital area region in the Governorate of Muscat  Amerat and Quriyat were severely affected. Gonu first hit the southern city of Sur late on June 5, 2007. Oman is one of the few countries with no National Red Crescent or Red Cross Society.  Despite that, the government managed to keep everyone alert and safe using the media and the areas that were affected have recovered. The Omani economy has been radically transformed over a series of development plans beginning with the First Five­-year Plan (1976-1980). At Sultan Qaboos's instruction, a vision of Oman's economic future up to the year 2020 was set out at the end of the first phase of the country's develop­ment 1970-1995. Vision 2020, outlined the country's economic and social goals over the 25 years of the second phase of the development process (1996­-2020). The direct rule of the sultan gives Oman a largely stable economic and social system free of party politics. Sultan Qaboos, encourages market-oriented policies and private sector development as the mechanism for prosperity and growth. Commercial export of oil began in 1967 and since Sultan Qaboos' accession to the throne in 1970, many more oil fields have been found and developed. In June 1999, PDO discovered a new oil field in southern Oman after drilling and testing three wells which demonstrated the commercial viability of the reservoir. This is the most significant find in five years. Work is continuing on the RO 503.876 million ( US$1,300 million ) oil refinery project in Sohar, which was due to go into operation in 2006 with a 116,400 barrels a day refining capacity. In 2004 Oman Oil Refinery was supplied with about 78,200 barrels a day for refining, while PDO began using steam injection technology in several wells to increase their productivity. Since the slump in oil prices in 1998 , Oman has made active plans to diversify its economy and is placing a greater emphasis on other areas of industry, such as tourism and natural gas. Oman's Basic Statute of the State expresses in Article 11, that, "The National Economy is based on justice and the principles of a free economy." The Vision Conference: Oman 2020, held in June 1995, has developed the following aims with regard to securing Oman's future prosperity and growth: In 2006, employees' salaries were increased by an average of fifteen percent, placing Oman in the category of high-medium income countries of the world. In Oman, about 50% of the population lives in Muscat and the Batinah coastal plain northwest of the capital; about 200,000 live in the Dhofar (southern) region, and about 30,000 live in the remote Musandam Peninsula on the Strait of Hormuz. Some 600,000 expatriates live in Oman, most of whom are guest workers from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, India and the Philippines. Of total population, about 55% are Ibadi Muslims who are related to the early Kharajites. Sunnis account for 38% of the population while Shia Jaffaris are 4%. The remaining 3% of the population are Hindus, Christians and other minorities, most of whom are expatriates. Since 1970, the government has given high priority to education to develop a domestic work force, which the government considers a vital factor in the country's economic and social progress. In 1986, Oman's first university, Sultan Qaboos University, opened. Other post secondary institutions include a law school, technical college, banking institute, teachers training college, and health sciences institute. Some 200 scholarships are awarded each year for study abroad. Nine private colleges exist, providing 2-year post secondary diplomas. Since 1999, the government has embarked on reforms in higher education designed to meet the needs of a growing population, only a small percentage of which are currently admitted to higher education institutions. Under the reformed system, four public regional universities will be created, and incentives are provided by the government to promote the upgrading of the existing nine private colleges and the creation of other degree-granting private colleges.   Oman is known for its popular tourist attractions. Wadis, deserts, beaches, and mountains are areas which make Oman unique to its neighboring GCC nations (Wadis in particular). Jebel Shams is Oman's tallest mountain, highest point, and is a popular destination for camping. Most of the major malls are located in Muscat, the capital. The largest mall in the country is the Muscat City Centre which was built by Majid hFuttaim, an Emirati business man. Other popular tourist activities include sand skiing in the desert, mountain-climbing, camel racing, and camping. The Muscat Festival is usually held at the beginning of every year. During this event, traditional dances are held, temporary theme parks open, and concerts take place. Another popular event is the Khareef Festival, which is similar to Muscat Festival; however it is held in August in Salalah, Dhofar. During this latter event, mountains are packed as a result of the cool breeze weather during that period of time which rarely occurs in Muscat.   Even though Oman is a modern country, western influences are quite restricted. The Ibādī form of Islam is also conservative like Sunni Islam and Shi'a Islam. About 83% of Oman is Muslim. As is the case with most Middle Eastern countries, alcohol is only available in some hotels and few restaurants. Although Arabic is Oman's official language, there are native speakers of different dialects, as well as Balochi (the language of the Baloch from Pakistan), or offshoots of Southern Arabian, a Semitic language only distantly related to Arabic, but closely related to Semitic languages in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Swahili is also widely spoken in the country due to the historical relations between Oman and Zanzibar. The dominant indigenous language is a dialect of Arabic and the country has also adopted English as a second language. Almost all signs and writings appear in both Arabic and English. A significant number also speak Hindi, due to the influx of Indian migrants during the late 1980's and the 1990's. Oman is famous for its khanjar knives, which are curved daggers worn during holidays as part of ceremonial dress.  Today traditional clothing is worn by most Omani men.  They wear an ankle-length, collarless robe called a dishdasha that buttons at the neck with a tassel hanging down. Traditionally this tassel would be dipped in perfume. Today the tassel is merely a traditional part of the dishdasha. Women wear hijabs and abayas. Some women cover their faces and hands, but most do not. The abaya is a traditional dress and it is currently having different styles.  The Sultan has forbidden the covering of faces in public office.  On holidays, such as Eid, the women wear traditional dress, which is often very brightly colored and consists of a mid-calf length tunic over pants. A very important part of Omani culture is hospitality.  If invited into an Omani house, a visitor is likely to be greeted with a bowl of dates, qahwa (coffee with cardamom - standard Arabic قهوة) and fruit. The coffee is served fairly weak in a small cup, which should be shaken after three servings to show that you have finished.  The dates are in lieu of sugar. Halwa and other sweets are often given at celebrations such as Eids.  The Cuisine of Oman is fairly simple and often utilizes marinades and the impregnating of meats with spices. Chicken, fish, and mutton are regularly used in dishes. A favorite drink is laban, a salty, buttermilk yogurt drink, flavored with cardamom. Dates, dry fruits and pistachio nuts are also very popular.   The national dress for Omani men is a simple, ankle-length, collarless gown with long sleeves called the dishdasha. The colour most frequently worn is white, although a variety of other colours such as black, blue, brown and lilac can also be seen. Its main adornment is a tassel (furakha) sewn into the neckline, which can be impregnated with perfume. Underneath the dishdasha, a plain piece of cloth covering the body is worn from the waist down. Omani men may wear a variety of head dresses. The mussar is a square of finely woven woollen or cotton fabric, wrapped and folded into a turban. Underneath this, the kummah, an intricately embroidered cap, is sometimes worn. The shal, a long strip of cloth acting as a holder for the khanjar (a silver, hand-crafted knife or dagger) may be made from the same material as the mussar. Alternatively, the holder may be fashioned in the former of a belt made from leather and silver, which is called a sapta. On formal occasions, the dishdasha may be covered by a black or beige cloak, called a bisht. The embroidery edging the cloak is often in silver or gold thread and it is intricate in detail. Some men carry the assa, a stick, which can have practical uses or is simply used as an accessory during formal events. Omani men, on the whole, wear sandals on their feet.  Omani women have very colourful costumes which vary from region to region. The main components of a woman's outfit comprise a dress which is worn over trousers (haaf) and the headdress, called the lihaf or hijab. There are numerous traditional styles of Omani costume seen in Muscat. However, there are three main types which show vibrant colours, embroidery and decorations. One style of costume is rather flowing and resembles that worn by the women of the Interior, while another is decorated with distinctive silver bands. The embroidery on these dresses can take around two months to complete. In the Dhofar region, the dress (or thob) is known as the Abu Dhail, which means 'one with a tail'. This dress is shorter at the front than at the rear and is made from luxurious velvet or cotton, shot with gold and silver embroidery, beads and sequins. It has a square neckline and is generally worn with a lightweight, cotton or silk sh'ela (head dress) which may also be sewn with pearls, sequins and sometimes small gold coins for special celebrations. Elaborate jewellery is often worn with this dress, around the head, neck, wrists, ankles, fingers and toes. The Dhofari women rarely wear a birka (mask), but the older ladies, originating from the Nejd (the desert area) and the mountains may do so. The birka is often dyed gold or indigo. Some women pierce their noses on both sides and can be seen wearing a carnelian stone, which is a dull red, and a gold flower stud. Indigo is often used as a skin preparation which is rubbed into the face and then washed off using the leaves of the becium dhofarense imparting a bluish tinge which is enhanced by the dresses and robes. However, more and more western dress is being seen, just as in all other Middle-eastern states. The most popular sport in Oman is association football. Almost every Omani is a big fan of this sport and the Omani team. The government aims to give young people a fully rounded education by providing activities and experience in the sporting, cultural, intellectual, social and scientific spheres, and to excel internationally in these areas and for this reason, in October 2004, the government created a Ministry of Sports Affairs to replace the General Organisation for Youth, Sports and Cultural Affairs. The International Olympic Committee awarded the former GOYSCA its prestigious prize for sporting excellence in recognition of its contributions to youth and sports and its efforts to promote the Olympic spirit and goals. The Oman Olympic Committee played a major part in organizing the highly successful 2003 Olympic Days, which were of great benefit to the sports associations, clubs and young participants. The Football Association took part, along with the Handball, Basketball, Hockey, Volleyball, Athletics, Swimming, and Tennis Associations. In 2010 Muscat will host the 2010 Asian Beach Games for the first time.   ang:Oman arc:ܥܘܡܢ frp:Oman ast:Omán zh-min-nan:Oman be-x-old:Аман ceb:Oman dsb:Oman hsb:Oman ilo:Oman bpy:ওমান pam:Oman csb:Òman lij:Òman nah:Omān nov:Oman pms:Oman crh:Oman sco:Oman scn:Uman simple:Oman sh:Oman udm:Оман diq:Umman bat-smg:Omans Geography of Oman Coastline 2,092 km Bordering countries Saudi Arabia, UAE and Yemen Economy of Oman Currency Omani Riyal (R$, OMR) Fiscal year Calendar year Central Bank Central Bank of Oman Stock Market Muscat Stock Market Demographics of Oman Languages Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Balochi, Urdu, English Religions Islam Ethnic groups Arab, South Asian , African Life expectancy 73.13 years Sports of Oman Popular Sport Football National Team Sports 5 National Clubs 48 Colors Red , White 4.
