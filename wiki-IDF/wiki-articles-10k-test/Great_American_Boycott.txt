 The Great American Boycott (known in Spanish as El Gran Paro Estadounidense, "the Great American Strike") was a one-day boycott of United States schools and businesses by immigrants, both legal and illegal, of mostly Latin American origin that took place on May 1, 2006. This date was consciously chosen by boycott organizers to coincide with May Day, the International Workers Day observed as a national holiday in Asia, most of Europe, and Mexico, but not officially recognized in the United States (despite the fact that it began there). As a continuation of the 2006 U.S. immigration reform protests, the organizers called for supporters to abstain from buying, selling, working, and attending school, in order to demonstrate through direct action the extent to which the labor obtained of unauthorized immigrants is needed for the economy of the United States. Supporters of the boycott rallied in major cities across the U.S. to demand general amnesty and legalization programs for such non-citizens. For this reason, the day is referred to as A Day Without an Immigrant in reference to the 2004 political satire film A Day Without a Mexican. An early ABC News article dated May 1, estimated that over one million people participated in the demonstrations. High rates of absenteeism were reported in the Los Angeles Unified School District and in Chicago, as well as in schools throughout the country with high Hispanic populations. Across the U.S., hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and supporters of a liberalized immigration policy, many dressed in white to signify peace, attended protests and demonstrations, the largest of which were in Los Angeles and Chicago, Illinois. Many who participated in the marches waved American flags, although some waved flags of Mexico and other Central and South American countries, while others waved flags bearing the likeness of slain Marxist revolutionary leader Che Guevara, and/or the red flag. In Chicago, Irish and Polish flags were also waved. The majority of demonstrations were peaceful, although a Vista, California rally took a violent turn at day's end when crowds began throwing rocks and bottles at sheriff's deputies. There were also two arrests made at a demonstration in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park. A stabbing that occurred near the location of the march in San Jose, California, may or may not have been related to the day's events. While the economic effects are unknown, some initial reports indicated that, while the boycott failed to halt "business as usual", commerce slowed significantly in certain areas. According to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, the boycott cost the Los Angeles economy $52 million, 4.3 percent of the normal $1.2 billion daily activity. In a show of solidarity, internationally, labor unions and other groups engaged in a one-day boycott of American products called the "Nothing Gringo Boycott", particularly in Mexico and Central American countries. It was later reported that this boycott had little effect on the American economy. Demonstrations were also held in major cities across Mexico. The boycott was announced on April 10, 2006 in Los Angeles, California by the March 25 Coalition of Catholic groups, immigration advocacy organizations, and labor unions. Hermandad Mexicana, an affiliate of the Mexican American Political Association, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), Amigos de Orange, and local MEChA chapters all promptly joined.Pacific News "Groups Call for ‘A Day Without an Immigrant’" The coalition arose out of protests against H.R. 4437, a legislative proposal that was passed by the United States House of Representatives on December 16, 2005 by a vote of 239 to 182, only to die in the United States Senate by not being brought to the floor before the 109th Congress ended. This bill would have made residing in the U.S. illegally a felony and imposed stiffer penalties on those who knowingly employ and harbour noncitizens illegally.  It also called for the construction of new border security fences along portions of the 2,000-mile United States–Mexico border. The coalition takes its name from the date of the first mass protest against the bill, a day which saw upwards of 500,000 demonstrators on the streets of Los Angeles, as well as hundreds of thousands in other major U.S. cities. The March 25, 2006 protests were noted for their peaceful nature, despite the controversy surrounding the immigration issue. LA Times"500,000 Pack Streets to Protest Immigration Bills" According to the New York Times,  The boycott and strike provoked controversy as soon as they were proposed. National organizations and prominent figures split over whether to support the boycott, with many moderates endorsing demonstrations but withholding support for the boycott. Many of the "moderate" demonstrations were scheduled for three o'clock in the afternoon, after working-hours for the many unskilled professions where illegal immigrant labor tends to be concentrated. President George W. Bush urged immigrants not to boycott, and instead to protest after work and on the weekend.Los Angeles Times "Bush Asks Immigrants to Reject Work Boycotts" California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said a boycott would "hurt everyone".Coos Bay Sun "Immigrants flex economic muscle with boycott"  On April 27, the California State Senate approved a measure to endorse a statewide economic and educational boycott. However, California's top education official opposed the boycott and called for students to stay in school on Monday. California Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell also encouraged students interested in the immigration issue to voice their opinions after school.San Jose Mercury News "State Senate endorses Monday's immigrant boycott; schools chief opposes it" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the city's first Mexican-American mayor since the 19th century, called for children to attend school and for a late afternoon rally.Los Angeles Daily News "City's students absent in droves" He also urged protesters to carry American flags, and not the flags of their home countries.Coos Bay Sun "Immigrants flex economic muscle with boycott" The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops offered Mass as an alternative to boycotting, and suggested that churches toll their bells in memory of immigrants  who died trying to come to the U.S. The bishops, too, urged students to stay in school.Fox News "'A Day Without Immigrants'" National Hispanic and immigration-advocacy groups were also split, with some fearing that the actions would provoke a backlash. The League of United Latin American Citizens, normally a moderate organization, was one of the few to fully support both the boycott and the strike.League of United Latin American Citizens LULAC press release The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) took a cautious stand of discouraging truancy from school, and encouraging participants in the strike to "get pre-approval of a holiday or 'leave without pay' from […] work".Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund MALDEF press release The Washington, D.C.-based National Capital Immigration Coalition denounced the Boycott, while the National Council of La Raza took no position whatsoever. Numerous anti-war, left-wing, socialist and communist groups also endorsed the Boycott. The Act Now to Stop War and End Racism coalition, in particular, provided signs and mobilized supporters to attend demonstrations, and while the American Civil Liberties Union took no official stance, it offered advice and information for protesters on its website.American Civil Liberties Union "Immigrant Marches / Marchas de los Inmigrantes" The AFL-CIO also endorsed the protests, saying that the H.R. 4437 "isn't the answer" to immigration issues.Why We Fight for Immigrant Rights The AFL-CIO's executive vice president, Linda Chavez-Thompson, stated: "We believe that there is absolutely no good reason why any immigrant who comes to this country prepared to work, to pay taxes, and to abide by our laws and rules should be relegated to this repressive, second-class guest worker status."Remarks by AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson at Immigration Press Briefing Organization of events fell to local groups. In some cases, the split that occurred on the national level was evident on the local level as well in that separate events were planned by the various organizers. Major events were held in:  Opposition to the boycott was expressed by members of the media such as Fox New's Sean Hannity who asked "Why is it that so many people who didn't respect our laws and our sovereignty are demanding for the right to stay here, demanding for the right to jump in front of other people who are going through the process properly, and those that disagree are being called racist and bigoted?" http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15086136_ITM Some members of congress also expressed opposition to the boycott including then republican congressmen Tom Tancredo who stated that "The iron triangle of illegal employers, foreign governments and (interest) groups ... puts tremendous pressure on our elected officials to violate the desires of law-abiding Americans. As nearly every recent poll shows, Americans want secure borders -- not amnesty -- and sooner or later they'll elect representatives who will listen to their constituents." http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=118567 Counter-demonstrations took place in various cities to coincide with the day's events, although they were mostly small in size. Some encouraged their members to buy from American businesses to offset the economic impact of the boycott. Among them are the Southern California talk radio hosts John and Ken, who called for "The Great American Spend-a-Lot", a contest with prizes for listeners who spent the most money.John and Ken Show "The Great American Spend-a-lot" The volunteer border security Minuteman Project, which has organized citizens' patrols along the Mexican border to monitor and deter illegal immigration, hosted rallies across the country, starting on Wednesday, May 3rd in Los Angeles.Grand Forks Herald "Groups rally in Minneapolis for tighter immigration controls" They also began constructing a six-foot high barbed wire fence along the border in Arizona.Columbia Missourian "Walkout by Latino immigrants set for today" According to Minuteman Project founder Jim Gilchrist, "It's intimidation when a million people march down main streets in our major cities under the Mexican flag. This will backfire." A new group, the 'You Don't Speak For Me' coalition, was formed in response to the boycott to challenge the notion that May 1 protesters speak on behalf of all Latinos. According to former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Pete Nunez, who is the group's spokesperson, "Millions of Hispanic-Americans -- including many who have gone through the immigration process the right way -- are offended by the demands being made by people who have broken our nation's laws."Yahoo Business News "Illegal Aliens on the Streets 'Don't Speak for Us,' Says New Hispanic-American Coalition" Some political commentators, such as CNN's Lou Dobbs, criticized the boycott for its promotion by groups such as the radical protest organization ANSWER, (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism). Dobbs also suggested that the choice of May Day betrays a communist affiliation on the part of the organizers, although May Day is part of the whole of the socialist tradition and not only of the later communist movement.CNN "Radical groups taking control of immigrant movement" The Washington Post suggested that the May 2 ouster of the mayor and two councilmembers in the town of Herndon, Virginia who had suffered criticism for their support of a day-labor center was a negative reaction to the Boycott.Washington Post "Labor Site Backlash Felt at Polls In Herndon" Some Southern and Western states drew up new tougher anti-immigration laws.Washington Post "After Protests, Backlash Grows"  The Post also credited backlash from the Boycott support in the Arizona legislature for the passage of laws penalizing businesses who hire illegal immigrants and on other crimes associated with illegal immigration.Washington Post "Hill Impasse Spurs States to Tackle Illegal Immigration" Georgia has also since passed a law, which will take effect in 2007, that prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving many social services and requires police and employers to report undocumented workers to the Immigration Service.BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4921000.stm "Mexico slams Georgia migrant law "]   According to an editorial by conservative commentator, Cinnamon Stillwell of the San Francisco Chronicle, "The one thing the boycott did achieve was to expose the lie that the country cannot function without the labor of illegal immigrants. While some may have been inconvenienced by the experience, the economy hardly came to a grinding halt. It seems there are still some jobs Americans are willing to do."SFGate.com "The Day Without Immigrants Backfires" The Great American Boycott of 2006 galvanized the sentiments of millions of people living in the United States both legally and illegally and highlighted the extremely emotional issue of illegal immigration in America, motivating thousands to join demonstrations in protest of a new stricter immigration policy as well as invoking intense debate on all sides of the political spectrum.US: Millions of immigrant workers join May 1st "boycott" On May 15, 2006, President Bush announced plans for the Pentagon to deploy up to 6,000 National Guard troops to help secure the Southern U.S. border.[CNN http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/15/sr.mon/index.html "The Situation: Monday, May 15"] H.R. 4437 was passed by the House of Representatives on December 16, 2005 by a vote of 239 to 182.

Madison - Between 3,000 (police estimate) and 5,000 (organizer estimate) people rallied at the Wisconsin State Capitol.  The turnout was smaller than at a similar rally that brought at least 10,000 to the Capitol on April 10.  Organizers believe forecasts of rain, along with false rumors of Immigration and Customs Enforcement roundups that had caused panic in many Wisconsin communities the week before, may have contributed to the diminished attendance.  Hundreds of students did not show up for school and at least twelve businesses remained closed.  Some of those at the Capitol rally carried posters bearing a photo of Republican Congressman James Sensenbrenner, the author of H.R. 4437 and a Menomonee Falls resident, with red "X"-es drawn across his face.Wisconsin State Journal "Thousands at Capitol support immigrants" Massachusetts - Across Massachusetts, the boycott did not result in the widespread work stoppages that some organizers had hoped for. Its impact was felt most powerfully in Latino neighborhoods and among young people, with an estimated 8,000 students staying away from school and marching in the streets. Thousands of workers and their supporters joined rallies and demonstrations across the state. There was a teach-in at Harvard, prayer vigils at Catholic churches, and rallies in the Boston area.

Mayor Tom Barrett addressed the ralliers, saying "Thank all of you for the fight you're fighting for peace and dignity.  You're showing Milwaukee and Wisconsin and the U.S. that the fight for justice can be done peacefully."  Wisconsin Restaurant Association president Ed Lump also spoke, emphasizing the importance of immigrants to the restaurant industry as workers, customers, managers, and entrepreneurs.
