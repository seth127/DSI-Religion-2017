   Kylie Ann Minogue, OBE (,See Pronunciation of Kylie. PronounceNames.commɪnoʊg;See Pronunciation of Minogue. PronounceNames.com born 28 May 1968) is an Australian Grammy and BRIT award-winning pop singer, songwriter and actress. Minogue rose to prominence in the late 1980s through her role in the Australian television soap opera Neighbours, before she commenced her career as a pop artist in 1987. Signed to a contract by British songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1988, she achieved a string of hit records throughout the world. Her popularity began to decline during the early 1990s, leading her to part company from Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992. During the mid to late 90s, Minogue distanced herself from her earlier work and attempted to establish herself as a credible and independent performer and songwriter. Her projects were widely publicised, but her albums failed to attract a substantial audience and resulted in the lowest sales of her career to date. She returned to popularity as a pop artist in 2000, and became well-known for her elaborate music videos and expensively mounted stage shows. In Australia and Europe, Minogue has become one of her generation's most recognisable celebrities and sex symbols. In Australia, after being dismissed early in her career by some critics, she has been widely acclaimed for her many achievements. Minogue released her tenth studio album, X, on 27 November, 2007, was awarded with an OBE on 29 December, 2007 for services to music, and then won the International Female Solo Artist award at the Brit Awards on 20 February 2008. Kylie Minogue was born in Melbourne, Australia, the first child of Ron Minogue, an accountant, and Carol Jones, a former dancer from Maesteg, Wales.   Her sister, Dannii, is also a pop singer, and her brother, Brendan, works as a news cameraman in Australia. Minogue attended Camberwell High in Melbourne. The Minogue sisters began their careers as children on Australian television, and from the age of twelve, Kylie appeared in small roles in soap operas such as Skyways and The Sullivans, before being cast in one of the lead roles in The Henderson Kids.   She gave her first singing performance in 1983, at the age of 15, on the weekly music programme Young Talent Time, a show on which Dannii was a regular performer.   Dannii's success in this program, overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements, until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986. In Neighbours Minogue played the character of Charlene Mitchell, a female garage mechanic. As stated in The Guardian,  "Her appeal at first lay in her unapologetic ordinariness... she played an oil-smudged mechanic with no desire to better herself. Charlene was happy to spend her life grappling with the intestines of greasy cars."  A story arc that created a romance and eventual marriage between her character and that played by Jason Donovan culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted a large audience.  Her popularity in Australia was demonstrated when she became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one event, including the "Gold Logie" as the country's "Most Popular Television Performer", with the result determined by public vote.  Neighbours began screening in the United Kingdom in 1986, and achieved high ratings.  During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed "The Loco-Motion" and was signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987.    Released as a single, and retitled "Locomotion", the Australian recording spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian music charts, and was the highest selling single in Australia for the 1980s.  Its success resulted in Minogue traveling to London with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote "I Should Be So Lucky" while she waited outside the studio.   The song reached number one in the UK and Australia and was a hit in many parts of the world. Her debut album Kylie, a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes, reached number one on the British albums chart and became the year's highest-selling album.  It sold over seven million copies worldwide, with most sales occurring in Europe and Asia, and it contained six successful singles. In the United States and Canada the album did not sell strongly, however the re-recorded version of “The Loco-Motion” reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. “It's No Secret”, released only in the U.S., peaked at number thirty-seven in early 1990. In late 1988 Minogue left Neighbours in order to concentrate fully on her music career.        A duet with Jason Donovan, titled “Especially for You” was a major success in the United Kingdom in early 1989. “Especially for You” was also the first Kylie Minogue single to sell over 1 million copies in the UK (The second was “Can't Get You Out of My Head”). The critic Kevin Killian wrote that it was “majestically awful… makes the Diana Ross, Lionel Richie ‘Endless Love’ sound like Mahler”.   She was sometimes referred to as “the Singing Budgie” by her detractors over the coming years.   Chris True's comment about the album Kylie for All Music Guide suggests that Minogue's appeal transcended the limitations of her music, by noting that “her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable”.   Her follow up album Enjoy Yourself (1989) was a success in the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia, and contained several successful singles, but it failed throughout North America, and Minogue was dropped by her American record label Geffen Records.  She embarked on her first concert run, the Enjoy Yourself Tour, in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Australia, where Melbourne's The Herald Sun wrote that it was “time to ditch the snobbery and face facts &mdash; the kid's a star”.   Minogue had become Stock, Aitken and Waterman's highest selling act, so in the face of widespread comment that the second album was a poor imitation of the first, it was decided to adjust the overall style of her music.  Rhythm of Love (1990) presented a more sophisticated and adult style of dance music and also marked the first signs of rebellion against her production team and the “girl-next-door” image.  Determined to be accepted by a more mature audience, Minogue took control of her music videos, starting with “Better the Devil You Know”,  and presented herself as a sexually aware adult. The singles from Rhythm of Love sold well in Europe and Australia and were popular in British nightclubs where Minogue started to be regarded as fashionable by the older audience she had targeted.  When “Shocked” reached the British Top 10 in 1991, she became the first recording artist to place their first thirteen single releases in the Top 10. In May 1990, 22-year-old Minogue performed her band's arrangement of The Beatles's “Help!” before a crowd of 25,000 at the John Lennon: The Tribute Concert on the banks of the River Mersey in Liverpool.  Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon offered Minogue their thanks for her support of “the John Lennon Fund”, while the media commented positively on her performance.  The Sun wrote “The soap star wows the Scousers — Kylie Minogue deserved her applause”.   Minogue's contract had been for three albums, but she was persuaded to record a fourth. Let's Get to It (1991) was designed to broaden her appeal by presenting a diverse range of ballads and slower dance songs. Despite generally positive reviews it failed to make the British Top 10, although the album spawned two UK Top 5 singles: “If You Were with Me Now” and a cover of “Give Me Just a Little More Time”. By this time Minogue had fulfilled the requirements of her contract and elected not to renew it. She had often expressed the viewpoint that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, and later compared the experience to her time with Neighbours, saying all they wanted her to do was “learn your lines… perform your lines, no time for questions, promote the product”.   Realising that her fans were growing apathetic towards the Stock, Aitken and Waterman formula, and that she could only develop as an artist if she broke away from them, she decided to leave.  She agreed to record three new songs to be included on the Greatest Hits album, which was released to coincide with her departure from them in 1992. Minogue's subsequent signing with Deconstruction Records was highly touted in the music media as the beginning of a new phase in her career, but the eponymous Kylie Minogue (1994) received mixed reviews. It sold well in Europe and Australia (where the single "Confide in Me" spent five weeks at number one.) Subsequent singles,  "Put Yourself in My Place" and "Where Is the Feeling?" were top twenty hits in the UK. Australian artist Nick Cave had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing "Better the Devil You Know", saying it contained "one of pop music's most violent and distressing lyrics" and "when Kylie Minogue sings these words, there is an innocence to her that makes the horror of this chilling lyric all the more compelling".   "Where the Wild Roses Grow" (1995), was a brooding ballad whose lyrics narrated a murder from the points of view of both the murderer (Cave), and his victim (Minogue), and its success demonstrated that Minogue could be accepted outside of her established genre as a pop artist.  It received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and acclaim in Australia where it reached number two, and won ARIA Awards for "Song of the Year" and "Best Pop Release".  She performed it with Cave at the Australian summer rock festival, "The Big Day Out" before a crowd of alternative music fans, and was well received.  She also appeared with Cave during several of his concerts in small venues throughout Europe, as well as the T in the Park festival in Scotland which gave her more experience performing outside of the dance/pop genre and before audiences that were not necessarily her fans.  She recited the lyrics to  "I Should Be So Lucky" as poetry in London's Royal Albert Hall "Poetry Jam", at the suggestion of Cave, and later credited him with giving her the confidence to express herself artistically, saying: "He taught me to never veer too far from who I am, but to go further, try different things, and never lose sight of myself at the core. For me, the hard part was unleashing the core of myself and being totally truthful in my music".   Impossible Princess (named after a poetry collection by artist Billy Childish) featured collaborations with musicians such as James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore of the Manic Street Preachers, and Minogue contributed the majority of the lyrics. Largely a dance album, its style was not represented by its first single "Some Kind of Bliss", and Minogue countered questions that she was trying to become an indie artist.  She told Music Week, "I have to keep telling people that this isn't an indie-guitar album. I'm not about to pick up a guitar and rock."   Billboard magazine described the album as "stunning" and concluded that "it's a golden commercial opportunity for a major [record company] with vision and energy [to release it in the United States]. A sharp ear will detect a kinship between Impossible Princess and Madonna's hugely successful album, Ray of Light".  In the UK, Music Week gave a negative assessment,  "Kylie's vocals take on a stroppy edge ... but not strong enough to do much".   It became the lowest-selling album of her career in the UK, but was her highest-selling album in Australia since her debut album, with sales boosted by a highly successful live tour. In reviewing her show, The Times wrote of her ability to "mask her thin, often nondescript voice with musical diversity and brittle charisma and genuinely great pop songs by any standard", and a live album recorded during her tour, titled Intimate and Live, was successful in Australia. She maintained her high profile in Australia with live performances, including the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the opening of Fox Studios in Sydney in 1999, where she performed Marilyn Monroe's "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend", and a Christmas concert in Dili, East Timor in association with the United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces. Minogue and Deconstruction Records parted company and following a duet with the Pet Shop Boys' on their Nightlife album, she signed with Parlophone in April 1999. Her album Light Years (2000) was strongly influenced by 1970s disco artists, such as Donna Summer and Village People and included several songs written by Guy Chambers and Robbie Williams who imbued their lyrics with humour. New Musical Express wrote: "Kylie's capacity for reinvention is staggering" and summarised the album as "sheer joy" and "what she does best".   It generated career-best reviews for Minogue and quickly became a success throughout Asia, Australia and Europe and sold over two million copies worldwide. The single "Spinning Around" became her first UK number-one in ten years, and its accompanying video, which featured Minogue in revealing gold hot pants, received widespread television airplay. The subsequent single releases were hits, including "Kids", a duet with Robbie Williams.          In 2000 Minogue performed a cover version of ABBA's "Dancing Queen" and her single "On a Night like This" at the 2000 Sydney Olympics closing ceremony, an event watched by an estimated 2.1 billion people in 220 countries. Afterwards, she embarked upon a concert tour, On A Night like This Tour, which played to sell-out crowds in Australia and the United Kingdom, where she sold over 200,000 tickets and set an Australian record for a female artist.   Her six initial planned shows were increased to twenty-two due to public demand. Minogue was inspired by the style of Broadway shows such as 42nd Street and films such as Anchors Aweigh, South Pacific and the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals of the 1930s. Describing Bette Midler as a "heroine", she also incorporated some of the "camp and burlesque" elements of Midler's live performances.   The show directed and choreographed by Luca Tommassini featured elaborate sets such as the deck of an ocean liner, an Art Deco New York City skyline, and the interior of a space ship, and Minogue was praised for her new material and her reinterpretations of some of her greatest successes, turning "I Should Be So Lucky" into a torch song and "Better the Devil You Know" into a 1940s big band number.  She won a "Mo Award" for Australian live entertainment as "Performer of the Year".  Following the tour she was asked by a Seattle Post-Intelligencer journalist what she thought was her greatest strength, and replied, "That I am an all-rounder. If I was to choose any one element of what I do, I don't know if I would excel at any one of them. But put all of them together, and I know what I'm doing."   In 2001 Parlophone released Fever, which retained some disco elements and combined them with 1980s electropop. Its lead single "Can't Get You out of My Head" became the biggest success of her career and reached number one in over twenty countries, which sold more than four million copies worldwide.Kylie: Music &mdash; Singles. Official Web Site. Retrieved July 21, 2007. The album's success was equally widespread, and following extensive airplay by North American radio, Capitol Records released it in the United States in 2002. It attracted favourable comment, with Rolling Stone calling it "campy as a tent full of Boy Scouts and yet easy on the cheese", while Popmatters described it as "a perfect album of gorgeous dance music".   Minogue attracted some negative commentary, such as from Launch's Bob Gulla, who wrote: "she'll do virtually anything to get our attention.  Not since Pia Zadora have we seen a more vacant talent grab... an astoundingly bland helping of hollow dance pop grooves and nauseating pleas for sex... it's so desperately lightweight it's in imminent danger of disintegrating altogether".    The album debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart at number three, and the single reached number seven on the Hot 100. Fever peaked at number ten on the Canadian albums chart and the single reached the BDS airplay top three. Following singles "In Your Eyes", "Love at First Sight" and "Come into My World" were substantial successes throughout the world, and Minogue established a presence in the mainstream North American market, achieving particular success on the club scene.  In 2003 she received a Grammy Award nomination for "Best Dance Recording" for "Love at First Sight", and the following year won the same award for "Come into My World". Minogue's former stylist and creative director William Baker explained that the music videos for the Fever album were inspired by science fiction films&mdash;specifically those by Stanley Kubrick&mdash;and accentuated the electropop elements of the music by using dancers in the style of Kraftwerk.  Alan MacDonald, the designer of the 2002 KylieFever tour, brought those elements into the stage show which was based around a framework of seven iconic female images, drawing from Minogue's past incarnations.  The show opened with Minogue as a space age vamp, which she described as "Queen of Metropolis with her drones", through to scenes inspired by Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, followed by the various personas of Minogue's career.  Minogue said that she was finally able to express herself the way she wanted, and that she had always been "a showgirl at heart".   Her next album, Body Language (2003), was released following an invitation-only concert, titled Money Can't Buy, at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. The event marked the presentation of a new visual style, designed by Minogue and Baker, inspired in part by 1960s icon Brigitte Bardot, about whom Minogue commented: "I just tended to think of BB as, well, she's a sexpot, isn't she? She's one of the greatest pinups. But she was fairly radical in her own way at that time. And we chose to reference the period, which was ... a perfect blend of coquette and rock and roll."  Body Language Live documentary, album launch press conference.   The show attracted mixed reviews, with the main criticisms being that nothing substantially new was presented, and that the new songs did not match the appeal of her previous hits.  Despite this, the concert was made into a successful television special that drew high ratings. The album downplayed the disco style and Minogue said she was inspired by 1980s artists such as Scritti Politti, Human League, Adam and the Ants and Prince, blending their styles with elements of hip hop.    It received some of the most positive reviews of her career with Billboard Magazine writing of "Minogue's knack for picking great songs and producers".   All Music described it as "a near perfect pop record... Body Language is what happens when a dance-pop diva takes the high road and focuses on what's important instead of trying to shock herself into continued relevance"   Sales in the United Kingdom and Australia were good but paled in comparison to "Fever", despite the large success of its first single, "Slow" and in the United States the album made little impression, although the singles became major club hits. In November 2004, "Slow" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of "Best Dance Recording". Minogue released her second official greatest hits album in November 2004, entitled Ultimate Kylie, along with her music videos on a DVD compilation of the same title. The album introduced her singles "I Believe in You", co-written with Jake Shears and Babydaddy from the Scissor Sisters, and "Giving You Up". Both songs reached the British top ten, and with a tally of twenty-nine top ten singles, Minogue became the second most successful woman on the British singles charts, behind Madonna.   "I Believe in You" reached the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play top three and attained dance and rhythmic radio airplay nationwide. Minogue was nominated for a Grammy Award for the fourth consecutive year when "I Believe in You" was nominated in the category of "Best Dance Recording". Early in 2005, "Kylie : the Exhibition" opened in Melbourne. The free exhibition featured costumes and photographs spanning Minogue's career and went on to tour Australian capital cities receiving over 500,000 visitors.    It was then exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in January 2007,  where the show set a new attendance record with 8000 visitors in one week.  Minogue released her Ultimate Kylie greatest hits album, and commenced a tour, Showgirl - The Greatest Hits Tour, which  was intended to be the most extensive of her career, and anticipated a total audience of more than 700,000.The show was a success in the United Kingdom, however shortly after Minogue arrived in Melbourne to begin her Australian shows, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. On 11 November 2006, Minogue resumed her Showgirl - Homecoming Tour with a performance in Sydney, joking with the crowd that she was, after an 18 month delay, "fashionably late". She had told journalists prior to the concert that she would be highly emotional, and she cried before dedicating the song "Especially for You" to her father, a survivor of prostate cancer.   Although her dance routines had been reworked to accommodate her medical condition, and longer breaks were introduced between sections of the show to conserve her strength, the media reported that Minogue performed energetically, with the Sydney Morning Herald describing the show as an "extravaganza" and "nothing less than a triumph".   The following night, Minogue was joined by Bono, who was in Australia as part of U2's Vertigo tour, for the duet "Kids", but Minogue was forced to cancel a subsequent planned appearance at U2's show, because of exhaustion.   During her last two shows, she was joined on stage by sister Dannii Minogue for the duet, their first performance together since the late 1980s. Minogue's shows throughout Australia continued to draw positive reviews, and after spending Christmas with her family, she resumed the European leg of her tour with six sold-out shows in Wembley Arena, before taking her tour to Manchester for a further six shows. On 31 December 2006 she saw in the new year with an extra sell-out show at London's Wembley Arena, where she was supported by ABBA tribute band Bjorn Again.   Her sister Dannii joined her onstage once more for the final Wembley show, on  9 January 2007 for a surprise duet on "Kids" and more sibling banter at the close of the show. On 21 September 2007 Minogues's official website announced: "The wait is finally over! On 26 November Minogue releases X, her first studio album in four years." The album, her tenth, features thirteen new tracks and was recorded in London, Stockholm and Ibiza. Producers include previous collaborators such as Guy Chambers, Cathy Dennis, and Richard Stannard, as well as newcomers like Bloodshy & Avant, Calvin Harris & EMI hit songwriter Edwin "Lil' Eddie" Serrano."Britney Spears, Blackout and Kylie Minogue, X".

She won the Best International Female Solo Artist award, telling fans: "I'm all overcome. This is so incredible." "All I See" will be the lead single in the US releasing in March. Fans are keen on Kylie shooting a video to accompany the release. In 1990 she was in a relationship with INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence, which furthered her attempts to gain acceptance as a mature performer, with Hutchence saying his favourite hobby was “corrupting Kylie”, and writing the INXS hit song “Suicide Blonde” in reference to her.   By 1997 Minogue was in a relationship with the French photographer Stephane Sednaoui, who described her as a combination "geisha and manga superheroine".  He began taking photographs of her that downplayed her glamour, with the aim of attracting a more 'rocky' and discerning audience, and she drew inspiration from artists such as Shirley Manson and Garbage, Björk, Tricky and U2, and Japanese pop musicians such as Pizzicato Five and Towa Tei   (with whom she would later collaborate on the singles "GBI: German Bold Italic" and "Sometime Samurai"). MInogue has gained credibility by her association with people such as fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier, photographer Stephane Sednaoui, and designer John Galliano, who described her as a "blend of Lolita and Barbarella". Her relationships, including her recently ended relationship with French actor Olivier Martinez, have been extensively reported.      In February 2008, the Hollywood rumour mill went into overdrive after Minogue and Martinez were spotted having dinner together in Paris. The couple reportedly talked about reuniting and starting a family but the singer later dismissed the reports. Britain's Press Association quoted Minogue as saying: "I had dinner with my ex-boyfriend and next thing I know there's a debate about whether we're having a family. We didn't even talk about that.".Kylie denies Olivier baby plans. NEWS.com.au. Retrieved on Feb 6, 2008.  Minogue's breast cancer diagnosis led to the postponement of the remainder of the tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival.   Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where the Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement supporting Minogue.   As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, the Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated.   His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.     Minogue underwent surgery on 21 May 2005 at the private Catholic Cabrini Hospital in Malvern. Friends such as Olivia Newton-John (who had overcome her own battle against the illness several years earlier) urged the media and fans to respect Minogue's privacy. Soon after, Minogue commenced chemotherapy as part of her treatment regimen. Minogue issued a public statement, thanking her fans for their support and urging them not to worry. On 8 July 2005, she made her first public appearance after her surgery, when she visited a children's cancer ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. She returned to France where she completed her chemotherapy treatment at the Institut Gustave-Roussy in Villejuif, near Paris.   In December 2005, Minogue released a digital-only single, "Over the Rainbow", a live recording from her Showgirl tour.  During the early months of 2006, media began reporting Minogue's upcoming projects and the general improvement in her health. In June 2006, she was reported to be recording material for a new album,   collaborating with Scissor Sisters, Steve Anderson, Richard Stannard, Johnny Douglas, Ash Thomas, and Teddy Riley while also making preparations to continue her newly renamed Showgirl Homecoming tour. Her children's book, The Showgirl Princess, written during her period of convalescence, was published in October 2006, and her perfume, "Darling", was launched in November. On her return to Australia for her concert tour, she likened her cancer battle and chemotherapy to experiencing a nuclear bomb, and expressed her determination to resume her career.     In 1989, Minogue starred in The Delinquents, which told the story of a young girl growing up in Australia during the late 1950s.  Its release coincided with her popularity in Neighbours, and while both the film and Minogue's performance received poor reviews,   it was a commercial success.      She appeared as Cammy in the action film Street Fighter (1994), based on the fighting game series of the same name. The film received poor reviews by critics, with The Washington Post's Richard Harrington calling her "the worst actress in the English-speaking world."   Subsequent films such as Bio-Dome (1996), Sample People and Cut (both 2000) failed to attract significant audiences. Australian film director Baz Luhrmann, cast Minogue in Moulin Rouge! (2001) where she played the part of Absinthe, the Green Fairy, singing a line from The Sound of Music.  In 2002, Minogue provided the voice of a young girl named Florence in the animated film The Magic Roundabout, released in 2006. She also sang the title song in the movie and was one of the two starring actors not replaced when the film was released in North America. In April 2007, News of the World reported that Minogue had been cast as a 'sexy Cyberwoman' in the 2007 Doctor Who Christmas special episode entitled "Voyage of the Damned".

The DVD will feature two discs, with Showgirl Homecoming Live (recorded in Melbourne, Australia December 2006) as the second disc.  Throughout her professional life, Minogue has been the subject of intense media interest in both the United Kingdom and Australia, which remained constant even while her success as a recording artist had temporarily fluctuated. Her efforts to be taken seriously as a musician have sometimes been hindered by her high profile as noted by The Australian, who wrote in 1997, "When you have to lug around an image the size of Kylie's, it's difficult for any music you produce to match the hype&mdash;especially in a country that gives scant credibility to pop".   Minogue is regarded as a gay icon, which she encourages with comments such as "I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits." While part of her appeal lies in her flamboyant costumes and her confident sexual posturing, she acknowledges the gay community throughout the world by performing at gay venues and events, and by openly supporting AIDS charities and gay rights causes. Her male dancers have often displayed overt homosexual attires and attitudes, like wearing high-heeled women's shoes, heavy makeup, dancing with other males, etc. She has said that she believes gay fans responded to her apparent distress when the news media began heavily criticising her in 1989, and that those fans have remained loyal, explaining, "My gay audience has been with me from the beginning... they kind of adopted me".  After playing the "girl next door" in her early music videos, Minogue began to touch on adult themes: a mature relationship in "Better the Devil You Know", lesbian posturing and drag queens in "What Do I Have to Do", telephone sex in "Confide in Me", and prostitution in "On a Night like This". She performed a slow strip tease in the Barbarella-inspired "Put Yourself in My Place" and wore revealing costumes in many of her videos, most notably "Spinning Around" and "Can't Get You Out of My Head". She satirised her image in the video for "Did It Again", in which the four major incarnations of her career, "Indie Kylie", "Dance Kylie", "Sex Kylie", and "Cute Kylie" battled for supremacy. Her evolving image and often overt sexuality led to some critical comparisons to Madonna.   Minogue has admitted her admiration for Madonna and has cited her as a significant influence. Minogue's status has led to her being referenced in several songs by other artists including The KLF's "Kylie Said to Jason" (1989), BMX Bandits', Soho's "Radio Soul Groove" (1992), "Kylie's Got a Crush on Us" (1993), KMFDM's "Sucks"  (1993), The Pretenders' "Popstar" (1999), Planetakis' "Dancing Pogo in the shoes of Kylie Minogue" and The Androids' "Do It with Madonna" (2003). In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to the photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that she had a "similar vulnerability and awareness of the camera". During her career she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new "look" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad group of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she has entered in the mainstream pop culture of Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate simply on selling records. She has appeared in guest roles in television series such as The Vicar of Dibley   and Men Behaving Badly in the UK, and Kath & Kim in Australia, which capitalised on her celebrity status and image for comedic effect. In the latter she played a Melbourne teenager on her wedding day, referencing her role as Charlene in Neighbours. Despite her commercial success, and her acceptance by a large audience as a contemporary sex symbol, her critics describe her willingness to display her body as an attempt to disguise a lack of talent. Her detractors, such as those discussed in the book La La La, have described her as a "one dimensional performer" and "pretty, but mindless and talentless". Miki Berenyi of the group Lush said "I have a massive problem with her because she epitomises the acceptable role ... it's a shame she gets so much credibility when there are so many women worth a hundred times that. It's war&mdash;you shouldn't stick up for Kylie, she should be fought at every turn". At the 2007 Q Music Awards, at which Minogue won the Q Idol Award, Ian Brown, former lead singer of the Stone Roses savaged Minogue, saying "I don't know what Kylie's doing at a music awards to be honest.  I don't think she's cute. I don't think she's good looking. Her music's rubbish - she makes music for little kids. I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm putting her down, but there's a lot of great minds out there making music and she's not one of them.""Ian Brown in Kylie outburst". Mancester Evening News. Retrieved on 2007-12-09. Minogue has often spoken of the stability of the team she works with. Her parents, Ron and Carol Minogue, are actively involved in her career; her father, an accountant, is her financial advisor and her mother has joined her on each of her tours. She has been managed by Terry Blamey since 1987 and the close network, along with her Stock, Aitken and Waterman origins, have led to comments that she is "manufactured", an assessment which Minogue has admitted is partly accurate, saying, "if you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go... Ultimately, yes, it's my name and I have to deliver the goods. But it doesn't happen without a team. So I try and work with the best people I can and take from them what I can. Hopefully I enhance what they do as well" William Baker has described her status as a sex symbol as a "double edged sword" observing that "we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record.  But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer".  In 1998, Minogue appeared as an underwear model for fashion retailer H&M. More recently, she inspired a limited edition beachwear range for the company and appeared in advertisements promoting it. The range went on sale in May 2007, and includes bikinis, scarves and swimsuits.   In 2000 Kylie Minogue performed at the Sydney Olympic Games closing ceremony. Designed by Michael Wilkinson, Minogue's costume featured a pink silk beaded corset and diamante headdress. It is housed at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney.   It has been confirmed that Minogue will be the image for the Spanish luxury brand TOUS, and she will be image for the company until 2010.Tous confirms Kylie's image. tous.com. Retrieved 2007-10-20.
