      James Tiberius Kirk is a fictional character in the Star Trek universe.  He was the lead character in the original Star Trek television series and the films based on the series. The character was played by Canadian-born actor William Shatner. Producer J. J. Abrams announced that Kirk would be a character in his upcoming 2009 Star Trek film  and actor Chris Pine will play the role. This will mark the first time in 40 years that the famous pop culture character will be played by an actor other than William Shatner. Series creator Gene Roddenberry is said to have based the character on C. S. Forester's fictional hero Horatio Hornblower. The character commanded the iconic Starship Enterprise in two of its incarnations. The town of Riverside, Iowa made a petition to Gene Roddenberry and Paramount Pictures in 1985, to "adopt" Kirk as their town's "Future Son". This promotion was similar to the town of Metropolis, Illinois, adopting Superman as their mascot.  Though reportedly Paramount pictures never officially replied, Roddenberry sent an "official" response, on his Norway Productions stationary, giving his blessing to their endeavor. The Riverside Area Community Club holds an annual "Trek Fest" in anticipation of Kirk's birth [ ], and the Starfleet International Star Trek Fan Association has commissioned a chapter of its group in the town's name [ ]. All materials associated with this "hometown" status, is of course, non-canon in CBS/Paramount terms. The non-canon Star Trek novel Final Frontier, not to be confused with Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, establishes that Kirk's father is named George Samuel Kirk. Several other novels, published by Pocket Books, list Kirk's mother's name as Winona. George Samuel, Jr. and Aurelan Kirk, Kirk's older brother and sister-in-law, died during the invasion of neural parasites on Deneva in 2267. Kirk's nephew, Peter Kirk, survived. According to dialog in the episode "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", Samuel "Sam" Kirk, Jr. has two other children. Although not considered canon, at least two Star Trek novels had material based in the real town of Riverside. "Best Destiny," an immediate sequel to the events shown in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, depicted Kirk's childhood in Riverside. The novel's opening chapter had a preteen Kirk playing with friends in fields near the English River. The novel Final Frontier, was written as a "prequel" novel to the Original Series. Telling about the space adventures of James Kirk's father, Commander George Samuel Kirk, Sr., the opening and closing passages of the novel show Captain Kirk mulling over his Starfleet career options shortly after his first five-year mission. The younger Kirk was shown walking around the farmhouse owned by his family in Riverside. Its wrap-around veranda had views of both the English River and the Iowa River to the east. In the world of official canon, Kirk is known to have fathered at least one child: David Marcus. He also fathered a child by the native woman Miramanee during a mission in which he lost his memory in the episode "The Paradise Syndrome," but Miramanee suffered injuries from her own people, resulting in feticide and her own death. Also, this episode established that Kirk's marital status as widower, since he was married to Miramanee during the episode. In Star Trek IV, he confirmed his birth place ("Let me guess: you're from outer space!" "No, I'm from Iowa, I only work in outer space.") His birth date has never been officially established, but the official web site suggests March 22, 2233, based upon the real-life birth date and age of actor William Shatner. Although born on Earth, Kirk apparently lived, at least for a time, on Tarsus IV, where he was one of only nine surviving witnesses to the massacre of 4,000 colonists because of utilitarian extermination by Kodos the Executioner. Kirk had a distinguished career in Starfleet Academy, becoming the first person to defeat the Kobayashi Maru test that stymied cadets for many decades. Whereas any situation would be met by the simulator's overriding dictate that the cadet lose, Kirk won by rewriting the program to allow him to rescue the Kobayashi Maru's crew. For this, he received a commendation for original thinking. He finished the Academy in the top five percent. Kirk began his Starfleet career as a cadet in 2250. He received help getting into the Academy by a man named Mallory, whose son later served under Kirk during his first command of the Enterprise and unfortunately died in the line of duty. While still a student at the Academy, he was granted a field commission as an Ensign and posted to advanced training aboard the USS Republic in 2251. While there, young Ensign Kirk accused Ensign Ben Finney of carelessly leaving a switch to the atomic matter piles open which would have blown up the ship in a matter of minutes. This later would come back to haunt Kirk in the episode "Court Martial." Kirk was promoted to Lieutenant junior grade in 2253 and returned to Starfleet Academy as a student instructor. Once he graduated from Starfleet Academy in 2254, Kirk was promoted to a full Lieutenant and served aboard the USS Farragut. He gained a tremendous amount of experience aboard the Farragut, commanding his first planet survey and also surviving a deadly attack by a gas cloud alien, in which a large portion of the Farragut's crew, including Captain Garrovick, were killed. According to the episode "Obsession," Kirk later felt that he had been negligent by hesitating when firing on the hostile alien life-form, which later killed Garrovick. Eventually Kirk learned that phaser fire had no effect on the creature and his guilt feelings eased somewhat, however he still felt great sadness over the death of the Captain (whom Kirk had always regarded as one of the finest men he'd ever known). Having risen rapidly through the ranks after leaving the Academy, he went on to receive his first command (the equivalent of a destroyer-class spaceship) while still quite young. [Source: "The Making of Star Trek" by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry] Kirk became the youngest captain in Starfleet to date at 31. According to the official Star Trek website, Kirk, at the age of 32, was the third captain of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), following in the footsteps of Robert April, who predated Christopher Pike as captain of the vessel. Kirk commanded the Enterprise's historic five-year mission from 2265 until 2270. Alongside Kirk was his equally legendary first officer, the Human/Vulcan Spock, who also doubled as the Enterprise's science officer. Filling out the crew were chief medical officer Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy, chief engineer Montgomery Scott, communications officer Uhura, helmsman Hikaru Sulu, and later navigator Pavel Chekov. The crew's dedication to Kirk mirrored his own relentless loyalty to his ship. Upon completion of the Enterprise's mission, Kirk achieved the rank of Rear Admiral, and was assigned as Chief of Starfleet Operations. In the Star Trek novel Star Trek: The Lost Years by J.M. Dillard, it is stated that during this time period, Kirk was a diplomatic trouble-shooter for Starfleet who was sent on various missions, including a counter-terrorism mission on the planet Djana. However, Kirk was unfulfilled in this administrative role. Spock later told his friend, "Commanding a starship is your first, best destiny...anything else is a waste of material."  In 2272, to combat V'Ger, Admiral Kirk took temporary command of the Enterprise over Captain Willard Decker, who oversaw the ship's refit while in dry dock. He retired from Starfleet sometime around 2282, but returned to active duty in 2284, where he was in command of Starfleet Academy training.  During his "retirement" - he had a romance with a woman named "Antionia" and almost asked her to marry him.  He also had a Great Dane named Butler. In Star Trek II, in 2285, Admiral Kirk briefly took command of the Enterprise in order to pursue his old enemy, Khan Noonien Singh. He was later demoted to Captain after stealing and scuttling the Enterprise, and sabotaging the USS Excelsior that same year in order to revive Spock, who died in the mission to stop Khan. Kirk was given command of the USS Enterprise-A, and commanded the ship for several years until the vessel was decommissioned in 2293. With Dr. Carol Marcus, Kirk had a son, David, who was killed by Klingons in 2285. The death of his son enraged Kirk for years to come. While he had always been distrustful and wary of the Klingons, after David's death, he held them collectively responsible for the death of his son. When Spock, on behalf of his father Sarek, opened negotiations with the Klingon Empire after the Praxis incident and 'volunteered' Kirk to lead the mission, Kirk was furious. When Spock pointed out that they were dying, his sharp response was "Let them die!" It was only when the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon, on his deathbed, pleaded, "Don't let it end this way," that Kirk started to realize not all Klingons were responsible for his son's death, and finally started to let go of his hate of the Klingon people. In Star Trek VI, a Klingon court convicted him of murdering Gorkon in 2293; he was sentenced to a life term in the prison mines of Rura Penthe, but was subsequently rescued and cleared of guilt. In the film Star Trek Generations, Kirk was lost and presumed dead when the USS Enterprise-B was damaged by The Nexus, which he entered. In this alternate existence, he was persuaded by Jean-Luc Picard from the year 2371 to return to Veridian III and stop Tolian Soran from sacrificing 230 million lives in order for him to re-enter the Nexus. During the climax, Kirk was able to retrieve and de-activate a cloaking control device from a damaged construction span, enabling Picard to sabotage Soran's plans. However, the span collapsed, causing Kirk to fall. Picard managed to get to Kirk as he lay dying underneath the wreckage, and subsequently buried his predecessor on the plateau. "Generations" conflicts with the TNG episode "Relics," where it is seemingly implied that Kirk was alive when the Scotty character became trapped in a transporter buffer until the TNG timeframe. The line uttered by Scotty just after his rematerializing, the source of the conflict, where he mentions Kirk by name, is attributed to his being disoriented however according to the Official Star Trek Web Site, StarTrek.com.  In the original script of Generations, Soran killed Kirk by shooting him in the back. This filmed ending was changed after negative reactions from test audiences. In books co-written by William Shatner, beginning with Star Trek: The Return, Kirk is returned to life by the Romulans and the Borg and goes on to have further adventures in the modern Trek universe. Pocket Books does not acknowledge the events of the "Shatnerverse" storylines in their canon, and thus Kirk has not appeared outside of the books written by Shatner. All of the Trek novels however, have an uncertain canonicity. In the Mirror Universe, Kirk was a loyal officer in the Starfleet of the Terran Empire. He commanded the ISS Enterprise after assassinating the ship's previous captain, Christopher Pike. Kirk's first action for the Empire was the execution of 5,000 colonists on Vega IX. His second action was the suppression of an alien uprising by simply destroying the rebels' homeworld. After briefly exchanging places with the regular universe's Kirk ("Mirror, Mirror"), the mirror Kirk was quickly locked up in the brig by Spock. He attempts to bribe Spock with money and his own command, but Spock refuses. Kirk is once again returned to the Mirror Universe at the end of the episode; it is unknown what happens to him afterward. The regular universe's Kirk would later be revealed as having convinced the mirror Spock to make the Empire more peaceful in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "Crossover." Unfortunately, Spock's reforms led to the Empire being attacked and defeated by the Klingons and the Cardassians. With the advent of Star Trek: The Next Generation, many Trekkers often compare the leadership styles of Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard: Kirk is deemed to very able to find ways "through unanticipated problems to reach [his] goals" and his leadership style is most "appropriate in a tight, geographically identical team with a culture of strong leadership."Paul Kimmerly & David R. Webb, "Leadership, The Final Frontier: Lessons From the Captains of Star Trek" CrossTalk: The Journal of Defense Software Engineering Oct. 2006 Both Kirk and Picard are considered to be attentive to the needs of their respective crews.John D.

Kirk becomes the most brutal dictator in history as the Emperor Tiberius. His Empire is eventually overthrown by Spock, as Deep Space Nine had confirmed with their Mirror Universe episodes, set many years after the events, starting with Crossover. Mirror Kirk found a way to form a joint Klingon/Cardassian alliance to invade and take over Earth and Vulcan, while he was put into cryo-sleep for the next 80 years, biding his time to return as Emperor in Spectre. In most other print sequels, such as The Sorrows of Empire by David Mack (part of the Glass Empires trade paperback), the mirror Kirk and Spock quickly become bitter enemies; eventually Kirk is assassinated by Spock, who takes sole control of the Empire. Kirk appears in the archive footage of the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "Trials and Tribble-ations," where Benjamin Sisko takes the chance to meet him after saving him from being killed by Arne Darvin. Kirk also meets Miles O'Brien and Julian Bashir after they get involved in the bar fight and Kirk interrogates the crew who took part in it. Aside from his above appearance in DS9 and his mention in "Crossover", Kirk is mentioned by Worf to Kor in the DS9 fourth season episode "The Sword of Kahless", where Worf asks Kor about the events of "Errand of Mercy." In the TNG episode "The Naked Now", when the crew are afflicted by a strange sickness which causes them to act drunk, Riker and Data are searching for a similar condition in the Starfleet database when they come across a log entry of the original Enterprise, commanded "by a Captain James T. Kirk." This is a reference to the TOS episode "The Naked Time", and implies (the unlikely fact) that Kirk is not well-known by the time of TNG, despite Riker referring to Kirk in the Generations film as someone whose death was notable in Starfleet history. In the Voyager episode "Q2", Icheb writes an essay about Kirk and performs a speech about Kirk in front of Captain Janeway. Q would later say that his speech wasn't very interesting. The character of Kirk is portrayed by fan James Cawley in his unofficial Internet-distributed fan-produced episodes of Star Trek: New Voyages. Captain Kirk also appears in The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny. Kirk was mentioned in Amelia Rules! by Reggie, who thought he and the others were in a parallel reality like Kirk did when other characters started being nice to Amelia and telling her to say hi for them to her Aunt Tanner.
