 Niue ( in English) is an island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean. It is commonly known as the "Rock of Polynesia." Natives of the island call it "the Rock."  Although self-governing, Niue is in free association with New Zealand, meaning that the Sovereign in Right of New Zealand is also Niue's head of state. Most diplomatic relations are conducted by New Zealand on Niue's behalf. Niue is located 2,400 kilometres northeast of New Zealand in a triangle between Tonga, Samoa, and the Cook Islands.  The Niuean language and the English language are both taught in schools and used in day-to-day business and communications. The people are predominantly Polynesian.  The first European to sight Niue was Captain James Cook in 1774. Cook made three attempts to land on the island but was refused permission to do so by the Polynesian inhabitants. He named the island "Savage Island" because, legend has it, the natives that "greeted" him were painted in what appeared to Cook and his crew to be blood.  However, the substance on their teeth was that of the red banana and not blood. For the next couple of centuries the island remained known as Savage Island, until its original name Niu ē (coconut behold) regained use. Yet its official name is still Niuē fekai (wild Niuē). The next notable European visitors were from the London Missionary Society and arrived in 1846 on the "Messenger of Peace". After many years of trying to land a European missionary on Niue, a Niuean named Nukai Peniamina was taken away and trained as a Pastor at the Malua Theological College in Samoa.  Peniamina returned as a missionary with the help of Toimata Fakafitifonua. He was finally allowed to land in Uluvehi Mutalau after a number of attempts in other villages had failed. The Chiefs of Mutalau village allowed Peniamina to land and assigned over 60 warriors to protect him day and night at the fort in Fupiu.  Christianity was first taught to the Mutalau people before it was spread to all the villages on Niue; originally, other major villages opposed the introduction of Christianity and had sought to kill Peniamina.  The people from the village of Hakupu, although the last village to receive Christianity, came and asked for a "word of god"; hence their village was renamed "Ha Kupu Atua" meaning "any word of god", or "Hakupu" for short. Niue was a British protectorate for a time, but the UK's involvement ended in 1901 when New Zealand annexed the island. Independence in the form of self-government was granted by the New Zealand parliament with the 1974 constitution. Robert Rex, CMG OBE (who was ethnically part European, part native) was appointed the country's first Premier, a position he continued to hold through re-election until his death 18 years later. Rex became the first Niuean to receive knighthood in 1984. In January 2004, Niue was hit by Cyclone Heta, which killed two people and caused extensive damage to the entire island, as well as wiping out most of the south of the capital, Alofi.   The Niue Constitution Act vests executive authority in Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand and the Governor-General of New Zealand. The Niue Constitution specifies that in everyday practice, sovereignty is exercised by the Cabinet of the Premier of Niue and three other ministers. The premier and ministers are members of the Niue Legislative Assembly, the nation's parliament. The assembly consists of twenty democratically elected members, fourteen of whom are elected by the electors of each village constituency. The remaining six are elected by all registered voters in all constituencies. Electors must be New Zealand citizens, resident for at least three months, and candidates must have been electors, and resident for twelve months. The Speaker is elected by the assembly and is the first official to be elected in the first sitting of the Legislative Assembly following an election. The new Speaker calls for nominations for the Premier; the candidate with the most votes from the twenty members is elected. The Premier then selects three other members to form the Cabinet of Ministers, the executive arm of government. The other two organs of government, following the Westminster model, are the Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary. Terms before new elections last three years. All Members of Parliament, past or present, are entitled to State Funerals. State Funerals may also be given as well to any distinguished individual offered the honour by the Premier and his Cabinet.     Niue is a 269&nbsp;km² island located in the southern Pacific Ocean, east of Tonga. The geographic coordinates of Niue are . There are three geographically outlying coral reefs within the Exclusive Economic Zone that do not have any land area: Niue is one of the world's largest coral islands. The terrain of Niue consists of steep limestone cliffs along the coast with a central plateau rising to about 60 metres above sea level. A coral reef surrounds the island, with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast, close to the capital, Alofi. A notable feature of the island is the number of limestone caves found close to the coast. The island is roughly oval in shape (with a diameter of about 18 kilometres), with two large bays indenting the western coast (Alofi Bay in the centre and Avatele Bay in the south). Between these is the promontory of Halagigie Point. A small peninsula, TePā Point (or Blowhole Point), is located close to the settlement of Avatele in the southwest. Most of the island's population resides close to the west coast, around the capital, and in the northwest. The island has a tropical climate, with most rainfall occurring between November and April. Some of the soils on the island are geochemically very unusual. They are extremely highly weathered tropical soils, with high levels of iron and aluminium oxides (oxisol), but as established by the research of New Zealand scientists starting with Sir Ernest Marsden, they contain surprisingly high levels of natural radioactivity. There is almost no uranium, but the radionucleides Th-230 and Pa-231 head the decay chains. This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds, but the geochemical evidence suggests that in the case of Niue the origin is extreme weathering of coral and brief sea submergence 120,000 years ago. A process, "endothermal upwelling" in which mild natural volcanic heat entrains deep seawater up through the porous coral may also contribute.   No adverse health effects from the radioactivity have been demonstrated and calculations show that level of radioactivity would probably be much too low to be detected in the population. These unusual soils are very rich in phosphate, but it is not accessible to plants, being in the very insoluble form of iron phosphate, or crandallite. It is thought that rather similar radioactive soils may exist on Lifou and Mare (island) near New Caledonia, and Rennell in the Solomon Islands, but no other locations are known. Niue has been self-governing, in free association with New Zealand, since 1974. Niue is fully responsible for its internal affairs. Having no military or the resources to maintain a global diplomatic network, New Zealand retains responsibility for the foreign affairs and defence of Niue, but these obligations are only exercised at the request of the government of Niue. The island mainly interacts with the world through its diplomatic mission in Wellington, New Zealand. Niue is also a member of the South Pacific Forum and a number of regional and international agencies.  It is not a member of the United Nations, but is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Ottawa Treaty. Niue established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on December 12, 2007.   Niue's economy is rather small, with a GDP of around $7.6 million estimated in 2000. Most economic activity revolves around the Government, as the Government was traditionally in charge of organising and managing the affairs of the new country since 1974.  However, since the economy of Niue has reached a stage where state regulation may now give way to the private sector in Niue's development, there is an ongoing effort to develop the private sector.  The Niue Chamber of Commerce is the body representing some of the private businesses on Niue. Following Cyclone Heta the Government made a major commitment towards rehabilitating and developing the private sector in Niue.  The Government allocated $1 million for the private sector, which was spent on helping businesses devastated by the cyclone, and on the construction of the Fonuakula Industrial Park.  This industrial park is now completed and some businesses are already operating from it.  The Fonuakula Industrial Park is managed by the Niue Business Centre, a quasi-governmental organisation providing advisory services to the businesses on Niue. Most Niuean families grow their own food crops for subsistence and some are sold at the Niue Makete in Alofi while some are exported to their families in New Zealand.  The Niuean taro is known in Samoa as Niue taro and in international markets as pink taro.  Niue also exports taro to the New Zealand market.  The Niue taro is a natural variety and is very resistant to pests.  The Niue Government and the Reef Group from New Zealand started two joint ventures in 2003 and 2004 involving the development of the fisheries and noni (Morinda citrifolia, a small tree with edible fruit) in Niue.  The Niue Fish Processors, Ltd. (NFP) is a joint venture company processing fresh fish, mainly tuna (yellow fin, big eye and albacore), for export to the overseas markets.  NFP operates out of their state-of-the-art fish plant in Amanau Alofi South which was completed and opened in October 2004, where they have facilities for freezing fish, blast freezers and ice towers for producing ice.  The fish plant is self-sufficient: they have their own power generators. Currently NFP use desalinated water for their operations. At the moment there are four fishing boats catching fish with more boats expected to join the fleet soon.  Niue is greatly concerned with the sustainability of the industry, limiting the number of boats fishing in Niue waters to less than ten at any time.  The Niue noni joint venture operates out of the Vaiea farm, which used to be a Government livestock farm and was later used as a quarantine station for alpacas airlifted from Peru to Australia, a scheme which has now ceased.  The company planted the biggest noni plantation in the southern hemisphere, consisting of over thirty thousand plants.  This may be the first time noni has been commercially cultivated in an open field, because noni usually grows in the wild on Niue.  There is also a factory at the farm for extracting the juice of the noni which is exported to New Zealand for bottling. In August 2005, an Australian mining company, Yamarna Goldfields, suggested that Niue might have the world's largest deposit of uranium. By early September, these hopes were seen as overoptimisticYamarna loses passion for Niue's uranium, The Age, 2005-09-06. Accessed 2007-12-24., and in late October the company cancelled its plans to mine, announcing that exploration drilling had identified nothing of commercial value.NIUE: No Mineable Uranium, Says Exploration Company, Pacific Magazine, 2005-11-03. Accessed 2007-12-24. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission filed charges in January 2007 against two directors of the company, now called Mining Projects Group Ltd, alleging that their conduct was deceptive and they engaged in insider trading. There is an Australian company that had been issued a mineral prospecting license in the early 1970s which is still very active in doing research and collecting data on potential mineral deposits on Niue. Remittances from Niuean expatriates used to be one of the major sources of foreign exchange in the 1970s and early 1980s. The continuous migration of Niueans to New Zealand, however, has shifted most members of nuclear and extended families to New Zealand, removing the need to send remittances back home.  In the late 1990s PFTAC conducted studies on the Niue balance of payments, which confirms that Niueans are receiving little remittances but are sending more monies overseas, mainly for paying for imported goods and for the education of Niuean students sent to study in New Zealand. Foreign aid, principally from New Zealand, has been the island's principal source of income. Tourism has been identified as one of the three priority economic sectors (the other two are Fisheries and Agriculture) for economic development in Niue. In 2006 estimated visitor expenditure reached $1.6million making Tourism a major export industry for Niue.  Niue will continue to receive direct support from the Government and overseas donor agencies. Air New Zealand is the sole airline serving Niue, flying to Niue once a week. It took over after Polynesian Airlines stopped flying in November 2005. There is currently a tourism development strategy to increase the number of rooms available to overseas tourists at a sustainable level.  Niue is also trying to attract foreign investors to invest in the tourism industry of Niue by offering import and company tax concessions as incentives. The number of tourists visiting Niue is increasing, climbing from 1939 in 2000 to 1446 in 2001, 2084 in 2002, 2706 in 2003, 2550 in 2004, and 2793 in 2005.  The main purpose of their visits in 2005 were: holiday (1236), business (664), visiting friends and relatives (591) and other reasons (302).  In 2005 tourists came from the following countries: Australia (304), New Zealand (1529), the South Pacific (296), Other Pacific (99), USA (136), Canada (45), UK (99), Germany (31), France (37), Other European countries (128), Japan (8) and other Asian countries (36). Government expenses consistently exceed revenue to a substantial degree, with aid from New Zealand subsidizing public service payrolls. The government also generates some revenue, mainly from income tax, import tax and the lease of phone lines. The government briefly flirted with the creation of "offshore banking", but, under pressure from the US Treasury, agreed to end its support for schemes designed to minimize tax in countries like New Zealand. Niue now provides an automated Companies Registration (www.companies.gov.nu), which is administered by the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development. Niue has licensed the .nu top-level domain on the Internet to a private company .NU Domain, but the company and the Government of Niue now dispute the amount and type of compensation that Niue receives from the licensor.[ ] Niue's economy suffered from the devastating tropical Cyclone Heta of 2004. Niue uses the New Zealand dollar.
