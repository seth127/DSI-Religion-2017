The first single released from the album "Thought I'd Seen Everything" was released in February 2008 to radio. Adams was born in Kingston, Ontariohttp://www.cityofkingston.ca/cityhall/press/release.asp?mode=show&id=161 to English parents, but also has Maltese ancestry, his grandmother being from Maltahttp://www.di-ve.com/dive/portal/portal.jhtml?id=281372. During the 1960s, Adams' diplomat father brought his family to various countries. Bryan passed part of his adolescence in Portugal, he lived in Birre, Cascais, 25km from Lisbon. As an adolescent, he pursued his musical goals with a singlemindedness. He explained to Carlo D'Agostino from Rolling Stone magazine, "In high school, I was too far into my music to even pay attention to girls." At the age of 16 Adams quit school and played in nightclubs in bands like Shock and Sweeney Todd, which released an album called If Wishes Were Horses with the very young Adams as lead singer.

A serendipitous meeting with drummer Jim Vallance in a Vancouver music store led to a song-writing partnership that continues to this day. As O'Hara from Macleans magazine phrased it, "Vallance was looking for a singer, Adams was looking for a route to musical respectability, and the two hit it off immediately." The pair began writing songs together and recording demonstration tapes. In 1978, at the age of 18, Adams sent a few demo recordings to A&M Records in Toronto, and was signed to them not long afterwards for the sum of one dollar. Saidman, page 47  He has released 14 albums since then. Some of the first demos written in 1978 have surfaced over the years, most notably "I'm Ready" (recorded for both the album Cuts Like a Knife and later his release for MTV Unplugged) and "Remember", which went on his first album. Both songs were covered by other artists before his first album was even released. Also recorded during this time was a demo of the song "Let Me Take You Dancing". It was remixed and sped up beyond recognition by his record company, and therefore doesn't appear on any of Adams' albums.  The self-titled debut album was released in February of 1980, and marked the beginning of what was to become a long songwriting partnership between Adams and co-writer Jim Vallance. With the exception of "Remember" and "Wastin' Time" most of the album was recorded from October 29 - November 29 1979 at Manta Studios in Toronto, and co-produced by Adams and Vallance. The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986. During the early 1980s Adams and Vallance also co-wrote a number of songs for Vallance's band Prism. Among these was "Don't Let Him Know", which turned out to be Prism's only Billboard Top 40 hit (#39 in 1982), but the first of many for Adams as a songwriter. (See Songs written for and/or performed by other artists in the Discography). Adams' second album, You Want It You Got It was recorded in New York City in two weeks and it marked Adams' first album co-produced by Bob Clearmountain.  It was released in 1981 and contained the FM radio hit "Lonely Nights", but it was not until his third album, Cuts Like A Knife February 1983, that he broke through with four hits in 1983, most notably with the title track. The album achieved much commercial success, rising to #8 on the Billboard Album Chart. Several of the songs on the album, including the title track, remain concert favourites with Adams to this day. Reckless was released on Adams' 25th birthday, 5 November 1984. It reached #1 on the Billboard Album Chart and gave rise to no fewer than six hit singles, including Run to You, Summer of '69 and Adams' first #1 single, "Heaven".Athough remixed Bryan Adams was the orginal song writer. All six singles charted in the top 20 in Canada.  Reckless has since been certified five times platinum in the US. In 1984, Tina Turner recorded a duet with Adams entitled "It's Only Love".  In addition to being a radio and MTV staple, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. In 1986 a live performance won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance Adams' 1987 album, Into the Fire was also certified platinum. This was the last album completely written by Adams and Vallance, but many of the fragments of their other songs ended up on the forthcoming blockbuster Waking up the Neighbours. Live! Live! Live! is the complete recording of a concert in Werchter, Belgium on 3 July 1988, which was broadcast by the CBC in Canada and on MTV around the world. One of Adams' most successful albums is Waking up the Neighbours co-produced by Adams and Robert Lange. The album was released in September 1991 and featured the single "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", which was also used in the film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves", starring Kevin Costner and Alan Rickman.

Canadian content regulations were revised in 1991 to allow radio stations to credit airplay of this album towards their legal requirements to play Canadian music. Adams has won a 1991 Grammy Award in the Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television category for co-writing it. The next album was the hits collection So Far So Good lead by the new song "Please Forgive Me", a slow rock ballad, both released in 1993. The single reached #1 in Canada, Australia and other countries and the album has since been certified five times platinum in the US.

The current lineup is as follows: Scott and Curry have been working with Adams consistently since the early 1980s, while Fisher and Breit have only been part of the band since the early 2000s.  Before them, Tommy Mandel regularly played keyboards in the band and Dave Taylor played bass guitar (1980s-1997) while Pat Steward of the Odds played drums in the early 80's, and is heard in the original Summer of 69. Since the 1980s, Bryan Adams has been a noted social activist, to this day participating in concerts and other activities to help raise money and/or awareness for a variety of different causes. His first high profile charity appearance came in 1985 when he opened the US transmission of Live Aid from Philadelphia.  In June of the next year, Adams participated in the two-week Amnesty International "A Conspiracy of Hope" tour alongside Sting, U2 and Peter Gabriel.  His next appearance for amnesty was in February 1987 on Rock For Amnesty with Paul McCartney, Sting and Dire Straits, among others. Playing in the U.S. section of Live Aid, Adams did not get the chance to play at Wembley Stadium, however another chance came in June 1987 when Adams played there at the 5th Annual Prince's Trust Rock Gala along Elton John, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and others.  Adams was to return to Wembley Stadium the following year when he played at the Nelson Mandela birthday party concert. Adams helped commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall when, in 1990, he joined many other guests (including his songwriting partner Michael Kamen) for Roger Waters' massive performance of The Wall in Berlin, Germany. Recently January 29, 2005, Adams joined the CBC benefit concert in Toronto for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.  20 years after performing at Live Aid in the USA, Adams played at Canada's Live 8 show in Barrie, Ontario.  Later that year, he played in Qatar and raised an astonishing £1.5M ($2,617,000) from the performance and the auction of a guitar he purposely had signed by many of the world's most prominent guitarists. The money went to Qatar's "Reach Out to Asia" campaign to help the underprivileged across the continent. Money raised also went to some of his own projects like rebuilding a school in Thailand and building a new sports center in Sri Lanka, both of which had been devastated by the aforementioned Indian Ocean tsunami.  On January 29, 2006, Adams became the first western artist to perform in Karachi, Pakistan, in conjunction with a benefit concert to raise money for underprivileged children to go to school.  Some of the proceeds of that concert also went to victims of the 2005 Pakistan earthquake. on October 18 2007, Adams was billed to perform in Tel Aviv and Jericho as part of the  OneVoice Movement concerts, aiming to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The peace concert for supporters of a two-state solution to the conflict with Israel was called off because of security concerns. Adams has also been involved in the production of records that have raised money for charity.  In 1985, Adams and songwriting partner Jim Vallance along with David Foster co-wrote the Canadian benefit record for Ethiopia called Tears Are Not Enough.  In March 1989, Rainbow Warriors, an album supporting Greenpeace and featuring Bryan Adams with other artists, is released in the Soviet Union on the Melodiya label.

In 1992, Adams became the centre of a dispute on Canadian Content regulations which were changed as a result. In the mid 1990s, Adams successfully campaigned for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary with Greenpeace Chairman David McTaggart (the two distributed over 500,000 postcards at concerts around the world encouraging politicians to vote yes for the creation of the sanctuary). After a performance in Amman, Jordan Adams pleased his Arab fans when they heard (during an interview with a local TV channel) that he was not a supporter of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Adams wrote a letter on behalf of the animal rights group PETA to protest KFC's treatment of chickens. He wrote to KFC Canadian CEO in November 2007 http://blog.peta.org/archives/2007/12/bryan_adams_tak_1.php asking them become leaders to use more modern and more humane methods of killing.

On May 15 of the next year, Adams returned to London to attend the Hope Foundation's event (hosted by designer Bella Freud), helping to raise a portion of the £250,000 to support the Palestinian refugee children.  On the same day, he was made an ambassador to the Prince's Trust, an honorary appointment made by Prince Charles' charity in London to raise awareness for young people looking for work.  The following June, he offered individuals from the public the chance to bid to sing with him live in concert at three different charity auctions in London. Over £50,000 was raised with money going to the NSPCC, Children in Need, and the University College Hospital.

He released a similar book of photos called Made in Canada in December 1999, and another one in 2000 called Haven. All of his books have been dedicated to his friend Donna, who died of breast cancer. As a photographer, Adams has worked with many of his musical peers, including Robert Plant, Joss Stone, Placido Domingo, Celine Dion, Moby, Amy Winehouse and Morrissey. On November 27th, 2000 Bryan played onstage with "The Who" at the "Royal Albert Hall."  A DVD of the concert was issued.  Bryan photographed the band and his photos appear in the DVD booklet.
