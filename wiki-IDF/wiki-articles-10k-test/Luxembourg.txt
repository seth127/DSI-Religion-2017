      Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (, , ), also spelled Luxemburg, is a small landlocked country in western Europe, bordered by Belgium, France, and Germany. Luxembourg has a population of under half a million people in an area of approximately 2,586 square kilometres (999&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Luxembourg is a parliamentary representative democracy with a constitutional monarchy, ruled by a Grand Duke. It is the world's only remaining sovereign Grand Duchy. The country has a highly developed economy, with the highest Gross Domestic Product per capita in the world. Its historic and strategic importance dates back to its founding as a Roman era fortress site and Frankish count's castle site in the Early Middle Ages. It was an important bastion along the Spanish road when Spain was the principal European power influencing the whole western hemisphere and beyond in the 14th&ndash;17th centuries. Luxembourg is a founding member of the European Union, NATO, the United Nations, Benelux, and the Western European Union, reflecting the political consensus in favour of economic, political, and military integration.  The city of Luxembourg, the capital and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the European Union. Luxembourg lies on the cultural divide between Romance Europe and Germanic Europe, borrowing customs from each of the distinct traditions. Luxembourg is a trilingual country; French, German, and Luxembourgish are official languages. Although a secular state, Luxembourg is predominantly Roman Catholic.   The recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of LucilinburhucKreins (2003), p. 20 (today Luxembourg Castle) by Siegfried, Count of Ardennes in 963.   Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a small state of great strategic value. In 1437, the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne, that led to the territory being sold to Philip the Good of Burgundy.Kreins (2003), p. 39  In the following centuries, Luxembourg's fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants, the Bourbons, Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, and the French, among others. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands.Kreins (2003), p. 70  The Congress of Vienna formed Luxembourg as a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands.  Luxembourg also became a member of the German Confederation, with a Confederate fortress manned by Prussian troops.Kreins (2003), p. 70  The Belgian Revolution of 1830–1839 reduced Luxembourg's territory by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to Belgium.Kreins (2003), p. 74  Luxembourg's independence was reaffirmed by the 1839 First Treaty of London.  In the same year, Luxembourg joined the Zollverein.Kreins (2003), p. 76  Luxembourg's independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 Second Treaty of London, after the Luxembourg Crisis nearly led to war between Prussia and France.Kreins (2003), pp. 80–81  After the latter conflict, the Confederate fortress was dismantled.Kreins (2003), p. 81 The King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, maintaining personal union between the two countries until 1890.  At the death of William III, the Dutch throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina, while Luxembourg (at that time restricted to male heirs by the Nassau Family Pact) passed to Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg.Kreins (2003), p. 84 Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by Germany during the First World War, but was allowed to maintain its independence and political mechanisms.  It was again invaded and subject to German occupation in the Second World War in 1940, and was formally annexed into the Third Reich in 1942. During World War II, Luxembourg abandoned its policy of neutrality, when it joined the Allies in fighting Germany.  Its government, exiled to London, set up a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion.  It became a founding member of the United Nations in 1946, and of NATO in 1949.  In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union), and, in 1999, it joined the euro currency area.  In 2005, a referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe was held in Luxembourg.Timeline: Luxembourg - A chronology of key events BBC News Online, 9 September 2006. Retrieved 8 October 2006.   Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Under the constitution of 1868, executive power is exercised by the Governor and the cabinet, which consists of several other ministers.  The Governor has the power to dissolve the legislature and reinstate a new one, as long as the Governor has judicial approval.  However, since 1919, sovereignty has resided with the Supreme Court. Legislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (Conseil d'État), composed of twenty-one ordinary citizens appointed by the Grand Duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation. The Grand Duchy has three lower tribunals (justices de paix; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch) and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.  Luxembourg's contribution to its defence and to NATO consists of a small army (currently consisting of around 800 people). As a landlocked country, it has no navy, and it has no air force, except for the fact that the eighteen NATO AWACS aeroplanes were registered as aircraft of Luxembourg for convenience.  In a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane, now currently on order.  Luxembourg still jointly maintains three NATO Boeing 707 model TCAs for cargo and training purposes based in NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen.    Luxembourg is divided into 3 districts, which are further divided into 12 cantons and then 116 communes. Twelve of the communes have city status, of which the city of Luxembourg is the largest. The districts are 1. Diekirch 2. Grevenmacher 3. Luxembourg    Luxembourg is one of the smallest countries in Europe, and ranked 175th in size of all the 194 independent countries of the world; the country is about 2,586 square kilometres (998&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in size, and measures 82&nbsp;km (51 miles) long and 57&nbsp;km (35 miles) wide.  To the east, Luxembourg borders the German Bundesländer of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and, to the south, it borders the French région of Lorraine. The Grand Duchy borders the Belgian Walloon Region, in particular the latter's provinces of Luxembourg and Liège to the west and to the north respectively. The northern third of the country is known as the 'Oesling', and forms part of the Ardennes.  It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff, which is the highest point, at 560 metres (1,837&nbsp;ft).  The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than four thousand people. The southern two-thirds of the country is called the "Gutland", and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse, and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions.  The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the south-eastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns. The border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling. Luxembourg has a marine west coast climate (Köppen: Cfb), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late summer. The people of Luxembourg are called Luxembourgers.Luxembourg Presidency - Being a Luxembourger The native population has a Celtic base with a French and Germanic blend.CIA World Factbook: Luxembourg Retrieved 14 October 2007.   The indigenous population was augmented by immigrants from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal throughout the twentieth century, with the majority coming from Portugal. Since the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, Luxembourg has seen many immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia. Annually, over 10,000 new immigrants arrive in Luxembourg, mostly from EU states, as well as Eastern Europe. As of 2000, there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37% of the total population. There are an estimated 5,000 illegal immigrants in Luxembourg.   Three languages are recognized as official in Luxembourg: French, German, and Luxembourgish, a Franconian language of the Moselle region very similar to the local German dialect spoken in the neighboring part of Germany, except that it includes more borrowings from French. So in principal Luxembourgish is a High German dialect with the status of a national language. Apart from being one of the three official languages, Luxembourgish is also considered the national language of the Grand Duchy; it is the mother tongue or "language of the heart" for nearly all Luxembourgers. Each of the three languages is used as the primary language in certain spheres. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally speak to each other, but it is not much written.  Most official (written) business is carried out in French. German is usually the first language taught in school and is the language of much of the media and of the church.  In fact, around 65% of all articles published in Luxembourg are in the German language, 25% are in French and only 10% in Luxembourgish. Luxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German, while secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French.  However, as proficiency in all three languages is required for graduation from secondary school, half the students leave school without a certified qualification, with the children of immigrants being particularly disadvantaged. In addition to the three official languages, English is taught in the compulsory schooling (mostly from the eighth grade, i.e. at the age between 12 to 14 years) and much of the population of Luxembourg can speak some simple English, at any rate in Luxembourg City. Portuguese and Italian, the languages of the two largest immigrant communities, are also spoken by large parts of the population, but by relatively few from outside their respective communities.  Luxembourg is a secular state, but the state recognises certain religions as officially-mandated religions.  This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages.  Currently, religions covered by such arrangements are Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, Protestantism and Islam . Since 1979 it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.   It is estimated by the CIA Factbook that 87% of Luxembourgers are Roman Catholics, the remaining 13% being made up of Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims and those of other or no religion. According to the most recent Eurobarometer Poll 2005, 44% of Luxembourg citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 28% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 22% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".  Luxembourg's stable, high-income economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The industrial sector, which was dominated until the 1960s by steel, has diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products.  During the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking and other financial exports, account for the majority of economic output. Agriculture is based on small, family-owned farms. Luxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see Benelux), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European market. Luxembourg possesses the highest GDP per capita in the world (US$87,995  as of 2006), the eighteenth highest Human Development Index, and the fourth highest rated in the quality of life index.  As of March 2006, unemployment is 4.8% of the labour force.  For the fiscal year of 2005 and 2006, Luxembourg has run a budget deficit for the first time in many years, mostly because of slower international economic growth.     Luxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours, although, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country, it retains a number of folk traditions. There are several notable museums, mostly located in the capital; these include the National Museum of History and Art (MNHA), the History Museum of the City of Luxembourg, and the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications. The country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, as well as the photographer Edward Steichen. Steichen's The Family of Man exhibition is now permanently housed in Clervaux, and it has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register. Luxembourg is the first city to be named European Capital of Culture for the second time. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture will be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event will promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional. For many people in other parts of Europe, Luxembourg is best known for its radio and television stations, Radio Luxembourg and the RTL Group, Europe's largest TV, radio and production company.      als:Luxemburg ang:Letseburh arc:ܠܘܟܣܡܒܘܪܓ roa-rup:Luxemburg frp:Luxembôrg (payis) ast:Luxemburgu zh-min-nan:Luxembourg be-x-old:Люксэмбург bar:Luxmburg ceb:Luxembourg crh:Lüksemburg pdc:Luxemburg dsb:Luxemburgska eml:Lussembûrgh fur:Lussemburc hak:Lù-sêm-pó hsb:Luxemburgska ilo:Luxembourg bpy:লুক্সেমবুর্গ pam:Luxembourg csb:Luksembùrskô lij:Luxemburgo jbo:la'o zoi Lëtzebuerg zoi nah:Luxemburgo nds-nl:Luxemburg (laand) nrm:Luxembourg nov:Luxembourg pms:Lussemborgh ksh:Luxembursh (Jruußhächzochdom) rmy:Luksemburgo sco:Luxembourg scn:Lussimburgu simple:Luxembourg sh:Luksemburg kab:Luxembourg tet:Luxemburgu udm:Люксембург vec:Lusenburgo fiu-vro:Luksõmburk vls:Luxemburg (land) war:Luxemburg zh-yue:盧森堡 diq:Luksemburg zea:Luxemburg (land) bat-smg:Lioksembōrgs Foreign relations of Luxembourg Radio Luxembourg Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg Communications in Luxembourg Military of Luxembourg Transportation in Luxembourg Luxembourg Boy Scouts Association   https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lu.html Governments on the WWW: Luxembourg History of Luxembourg: Primary Documents Official Governmental Site Official Website for Luxembourg Luxembourg National Tourist Office Luxembourg Tourist Office - London Luxembourg City Tourist Guide Luxembourg Geography Luxembourg European Capital of Culture 2007 World Factbook: Information on Luxembourg Over 200 images of important sights in Luxembourg Chabad Lubavitch of Luxembourg  :LINKNUM:298
