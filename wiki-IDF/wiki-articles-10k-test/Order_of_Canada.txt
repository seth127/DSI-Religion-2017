  The Order of Canada is Canada's highest civilian honour within the Canadian system of honours, with membership awarded to those who exemplify the Order's Latin motto Desiderantes meliorem patriam, which means "(those) desiring a better country" (Hebrews 11:16). Created in 1967, the Order was established to recognize the lifetime contributions made by Canadians who made a major difference to Canada. The Order also recognizes efforts made by non-Canadians who have made the world better by their actions. Musicians, politicians, artists, television and film stars, benefactors, and many more have been accepted into the Order. The Queen of Canada, Queen Elizabeth II, is Sovereign of the Order and the serving Governor General of Canada is its Chancellor and Principal Companion. Since its inception, 5,268 people have been appointed to the Order of Canada.Based on the First edition of Order of Canada newsletter published in May 2007..  The Order of Canada was instituted on April 17, 1967, by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of Prime Minister Lester Pearson. Pearson was assisted with the establishment of the order by John Matheson. The Order was created to recognize exemplary achievement and service to Canada, by Canadians. The awards were officially launched on July 1, 1967, during the 100th anniversary celebrations of the formation of the Dominion of Canada. Governor General Roland Michener was the first inductee to the order, with 90 more people appointed on July 7, 1967. The creation of the Order was the beginning of the establishment of a Canadian honours system, a system of awards and decorations to be bestowed onto Canadians and foreigners. Upon the creation of the system, it broke off the dependence of the honours system used by the United Kingdom and by some of its former Crown colonies and Dominions. Before the Order of Canada was created, the main order presented to Canadians for the above criteria was the Order of the British Empire.Paul James article on British Orders. The first appointee (selection) and investiture (inducting) was for Roland Michener, the twentieth Governor General of Canada, to the level of Companion.Roland Michener's listing on the Order of Canada rolls. Other first appointees included Vincent Massey, Louis St. Laurent, Hugh MacLennan, Father David Bauer, Gabrielle Roy, Donald Creighton, Thérèse Casgrain, Wilder Penfield, Arthur Lismer, and Maurice Richard.Governor General Adrienne Clarkson's speech at an October 30, 2004, Order of Canada investiture .

Royal Insight Magazine: Mailbox: April 2006 Page 3  Since the Order of Canada was created, Australia has created a system of awards based on the Order of Canada: the Order of Australia. However, the Order of Australia has been awarded more liberally, especially to foreigners, than has the Order of Canada. In 1996, New Zealand created the New Zealand Order of Merit, a five-level order of chivalry modelled on the Order of the British Empire. The Order of New Zealand is modelled on the Order of the Companions of Honour and the Order of Merit.  There are three grades (levels) of the Order of Canada: Companion (highest), Officer, and Member, each with respective post-nominal letters that its members are entitled to use. Promotions in grade are possible; typically, this is not done until at least five years after the initial appointment. For example, film director Denys Arcand was promoted from Officer to Companion.Announcement of Denys Arcand's promotion in the Order Originally, the Order had only two ranks, Companion and two medals, the Medal of Courage (now the Cross of Valour)The Canadian Encyclopedia entry on the Order and the Medal of Service. On July 1, 1972, the levels of Officer and Member were introduced and all existing holders of the Medal of Service were made Officers. (The Medal of Courage had never been awarded.)  Companions of the Order of Canada (post-nominal: C.C.) have demonstrated the highest degree of merit to Canada and humanity, on the national or international scene. Up to 15 Companions are appointed each year, with a limit of 165 living Companions at any given time, with the exception of honorary Companions.Order of Canada Constitution. As of February 20, 2007, there were 168 living Companions, including four honorary Companions.The criteria were Honours received: C.C., Living and Records per page: All However, the Governor General is the Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order,Insignia Worn by the Governor General and thus with the appointment of Michaëlle Jean to the position of Governor General she became the 164th living Companion. The Constitution of the Order of Canada also allows for the spouse of the Governor General to be appointed a Companion, so Jean-Daniel Lafond is the 165th living Companion. On February 20, 2007, Rideau Hall announced that Richard Drouin, Joseph Gosnell, and Ron Southern had been promoted to the rank of Companion.Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada Officers of the Order of Canada (O.C.) have demonstrated an outstanding level of talent and service to Canadians. Up to 64 Officers are appointed each year. As of September 29 2005, there were 1,006 living Officers, although there is no limit to how many may be living at one time.The criteria was Honours received: O.C., Living and Records per page: All. Members of the Order of Canada (C.M.) have made an exceptional contribution to Canada or Canadians at a local or regional level, group, field or activity. As many as 136 Members may be appointed annually and there is no limit on how many Members may be living. As of September 29 2005, there were 1,964 living members.The criteria was Honours received: C.M., Living and Records per page: All.  The badge of the Order is a white enamelled snowflake design, in gilt for Companions and Officers, and in silver for Members. The central disc bears a maple leaf, in red enamel for Companions, in gold for Officers, and in silver for Members, all on a white enamel background, surrounded by a red enamel ring (annulus) bearing the motto of the Order, and topped by a crown of St. Edward, symbolizing that the award is granted by the Sovereign. The reverse is plain except for the word "Canada".Pictures of the backside of the various medal designs. The ribbon is white bordered in red stripes, similar to the Canadian flag. The insignia may be passed down as a family heirloom but may not be sold. When a member of the order is upgraded to a higher rank that individual must return their original emblem to the Chancellery.Constitution of the Order Section 24-(3)-B However, a number of insignias have been put up for sale, most recently in 2007 (see Sale below}. The badge (as well as the majority of the ensuing emblems in the Canadian honour system) was designed by Bruce W. Beatty, who as of 2004 has been in attendance at every investiture ceremony since 1967.Canada's House: Rideau Hall and the invention of a Canadian home by Margaret MacMillan, Marjorie Harris and Anne L. Desjardins in conversation with Adrienne Clarkson and John Ralston Saul. Toronto: A.A. Knopf Canada with Otherwise Editions, 2004. ISBN 0-676-97675-1 page 58 Beatty was himself made a member of the Order in 1990.Bruce W. Beatty's Membership citation When wearing medals and decorations, the Order of Canada is worn before all national orders and nearly all other Canadian decorations: only the Victoria Cross and the Cross of Valour are worn before the Order of Canada. The grades of Companion and Officer have their medals worn by a neck ribbon, while the Member grade is displayed on a chest ribbon on the left side of the jacket. Originally, protocol dictated that female appointees had to wear a ribbon bow in order to display the Order, which was positioned to the left. In 1997 regulations were altered and with the exception of certain special occasions laid out by the Governor General, women may wear their Order by the same means as the men, although current governor general Michaëlle Jean has taken to displaying the order with the female bowThe Canadian Honours System: Wearing Of Orders, Decorations and medals. page 2. The chest ribbon is the same for each grade, save for a metallic maple leaf in the centre, the color of which depends on the grade that one was appointed to: red for a Companion, gold for an Officer, silver stands for a Member. Each appointee is also granted the right to ask for a coat of arms from the Canadian Heraldic Authority if one does not exist for them. Companions can ask the Authority for the use of supporters on their personal coat of arms. The Order motto (in gold lettering on a red background) is circled around the shield, while the Order badge is suspended from the base of the shield. Because the Queen is sovereign of the Order, the current Coat of Arms of Canada, in use since 1994, uses the red ribbon with the Order motto in gold.http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm — Coat of Arms of Canada. For civilian wear, a lapel pin is worn on the jacket, which is designed as a miniature of the medal design. An example of one being used is shown in this photo of Roméo Dallaire, O.C. The Governor General also wears a special chain during certain ceremonies. The chain consisted of the Companion badge, suspended from the shield of Canada, surmounted by the crown. On each side, the necklace is composed of two repeating elements: a white stylized snowflake and the central disc that appears on the Companion medals. At the Governor General's installation ceremony he or she is presented with the Chain of the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit.   All living Canadians are eligible for any of the three awards, except federal and provincial politicians and judges while they are holding office. Awards are announced twice annually, once around New Year's Day (January 1) and again around Canada Day (July 1). Appointees who have died before their investiture are still considered part of the Order. Multiple people who have committed the same honourable act or deed are eligible for induction. For example, all three members of the Canadian band Rush (Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart) have been appointed Officers of the Order, the first time the Order of Canada was given to a group rather than an individual. All three members of the children's group Sharon, Lois & Bram (Sharon Trostin Hampson, Lois Lilienstein and Bramwell Morrison) have also been made members of the Order—although, since Lilienstein is an American citizen, she was made an honorary member (see below). Citizens of other countries are eligible for honorary appointments at all three levels. No more than five honorary appointments may be made in any year. Although inductions are usually performed by the Governor General, the task can be delegated to another individual, such as the Lieutenant-Governor of a Canadian province. This was the case when Mervyn Wilkinson was inducted into the order by Iona Campagnolo, the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, in 2002.Investiture of Member of The Order of Canada - Mr. Mervyn Wilkinson. Accessed March 11, 2007 Although sitting federal and provincial politicians cannot be appointed to the Order while in office, it is accepted that influential leaders such as former prime ministers will be appointed after they leave office. In fact, of all the prime ministers alive after the creation of the order (with the exception of recent and current Prime Ministers Kim Campbell, Paul Martin and Stephen Harper), the only prime minister who was not appointed to the Order was John Diefenbaker. After losing the office of the Prime Minister to Lester B. Pearson in 1963 Diefenbaker remained a sitting Member of Parliament and died while still in office in 1979, never becoming eligible. Some prominent politicians — such as former NDP leader Ed Broadbent and former Prime Minister Joe Clark — were appointed after exiting politics, only to later return to elected office. In the same vein as Prime Ministers being appointed after leaving office, every Chief Justice of Canada from Robert Taschereau onward has been made a Companion, with the exception of Beverley McLachlin, who is the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Although sitting politicians cannot be appointed to the order while in office, individuals who hold a ceremonial political office (for example a Sergeant-at-arms) are considered public servants and therefore can be invested while serving in that office. Senators cannot be appointed while they hold office; however, there have been several senators who were appointed to the Order prior to taking office. Currently there are 12 senators who hold the Order: Tommy Banks, Michel Biron, Roméo Dallaire, Trevor Eyton, Serge Joyal, Wilbert Keon, Jean Lapointe, Sandra Lovelace Nicholas, Frank Mahovlich, Donald Oliver, Nancy Ruth, and Hugh Segal. A new member whose appointment is approved during their lifetime, but who dies prior to the announcement of that appointment or their investiture, may be invested posthumously. The 2005 appointment of journalist Peter Jennings was announced under these circumstances;Governor General announces new appointments to the Order of Canada. Rideau Hall announcement of Peter Jenning's posthumous appointment. his daughter Elizabeth Jennings accepted the insignia on her father's behalf in October 2006.[ ] Image of Elizabeth Jennings accepting Peter Jennings Order of Canada medal The oldest person ever to be invested into the Order was Dr. Cornelius Wiebe, who was 106 years old when he was invested in 1999.Cornelius Wiebe's Order of Canada citation http://www.gg.ca/Search/honours_descript_e.asp?type=2&id=3971 Induction ceremonies are generally conducted by the Governor General at Rideau Hall in Ottawa or, on rare occasions when she is in the country, by the Queen herself; the Queen performed her first Order of Canada investiture at Rideau Hall in August 1973.Hubbard, R.H.; Rideau Hall; McGill-Queen's University Press; Montreal and London; 1977; p. 243 The most common reason for the insignia not being presented at Rideau Hall is the recipient's inability to come to Ottawa. An early example of this occurred in 1980 when activist athlete Terry Fox was dying of terminal cancer. A more recent example occurred in 2003 with singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot. In 2002, shortly before a concert, Lightfoot suffered a serious abdominal hemorrhage that resulted in his being in a coma for a time and months in hospital recovering. On the news of his near-death condition, Lightfoot was promoted to the rank of Companion. Since his condition left him unable to travel, Adrienne Clarkson flew to Toronto and presented him with the insignia in a private ceremony performed in his hospital room.http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/12/13/canada/lightfoot_031213 CBC story on Lightfoot's C.C. presentation.http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4090. Gordon Lightfoot's C.C. Citation. Another example is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother: in 2000, at the age of 100, Her Majesty was invested as an Honorary Companion at Clarence House in London. Rather than place the insignia on the Queen Mother, who was recovering from a hip replacement, Clarkson handed Her Majesty her badge. Her Majesty made a point of wearing it around her neck at a special lunch following the private ceremony.http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2000/10/31/queenmum001031.html CBC article about Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother's investiture Prior to Clarkson becoming Governor General of Canada, Order of Canada inductions were rarely performed outside of Rideau Hall or the Governor General's secondary residence La Citadelle. Under her tenure Clarkson held entire investment ceremonies in cities like St. John's, Newfoundland and Vancouver, British Columbia. She was also noted for delegating the duty to other individuals on certain occasions when it would have been difficult for her or the recipient to travel.  Members can be removed from the Order if the Advisory Council feels their actions have brought it into disrepute. As of 2006, only two people have their Order of Canada stripped from them: Alan Eagleson and David Ahenakew. Eagleson was removed from the order after being jailed for fraud in 1998.http://archives.cbc.ca/IDCC-1-41-1493-10073/sports/alan_eagleson/ CBC account on the rise and fall of Eagleson. Ahenakew began facing calls for his removal due to anti-Semitic comments he made in 2002.Quebec Cree Chief wants Ahenakew to lose Order of Canada. CBC article on Ahenakew's comments and reactions. After being convicted on charges of wilfully promoting hatred, the Governor General and the Advisory Council told the CBC that Ahenakew would be stripped of his honour, and gave him the option to surrender his badge. On 11 July 2005, the Governor General signed an order, called a revocation ordinance, stripping Ahenakew of his membership in the Order of Canada. (In 2006 the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan, sitting on appeal of the Provincial Court decision, ordered a retrial of Ahenakew's hate crime conviction on the grounds that criminal intent had not been properly considered by the trial judge, and the Crown has chosen to take the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The Governor General's office declared that this did not change the finding that he had brought the Order of Canada into disrepute and should be expelled.)http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050706.wahenakews0706/BNStory/National/ The Globe and Mail article on Ahenakew's removal from the Order.http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/cpress/20050707/ca_pr_on_na/crime_ahenakew_hate_1 Canadian Press confirming the CBC's report of Ahenakew's removal.http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/07/11/ahenakew050711.html CBC announces the Order being revoked from Ahenakew. In order for a person to be stripped of their honour, the Advisory Council must agree to the removal, then send a letter to the person telling them of their decision. In this same letter, the Council also gives the person a time to respond to the decision. In the case of Ahenakew, a registered letter was sent to him asking for a response to their idea of taking his honour away. Ahenakew, who had until 9 July 2005 to respond, refused to do so. That led the Governor General to sign the above order on 11 July to take away his honour. Ahenakew is now required to surrender his medal and his civilian lapel pin. While there are no formal rules the Council has to retrieve the insignia, Ahenakew's lawyer Doug Christie said that "I think that once you are given a gift, and it is a gift, I don't think anyone can ask for it back," implying that Ahenakew has the right to keep his items. However, the author of the book The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development, Christopher McCreery, said that since the government owns the medal and the scrolls, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police can be sent and get the items by force. McCreery stated that he does not think the RCMP would be used in Ahenakew's situation.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050713/AHENAKEW13/TPNational/Canada Globe and Mail's article on the process of removing Ahenakew from the Order.   The task of the Advisory Council is to evaluate the nominations of people to the Order and see if the nominated people are worthy enough to be accepted into the Order. The Governor General of Canada makes the appointments to the Order based on recommendations from the Advisory Council. The Secretary General to the Advisory Council announces the decision of the Advisory Council to the Canada Gazette and to the public about any appointments and dismissals from the Order. The Advisory Council, which is chaired by the Chief Justice of Canada, includes the Clerk of the Privy Council, the Deputy Minister of the Department of Canadian Heritage, the Chairperson of the Canada Council for the Arts, the President of the Royal Society of Canada, and the Chairperson of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. As well, five members of the Order are part of the Council for a maximum three-year term. If the nomination involves a non-Canadian, the Deputy Minister of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade will be invited by the Advisory Council to evaluate the nomination. The current members of the Advisory Council are: Members can be found in  and citation can be found on the Order of Canada database at gg.ca. As of 2006, there have been only ten honorary appointments to non-Canadian citizens, and one appointee surrendered his Canadian citizenship. They are as follows: 1.

Nevertheless, he remains in both the Order of Canada and the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. Due to his conviction for mail fraud in 2007, a council will meet to decide if Black will remain in the Order.

Main article: Canadian provincial and territorial orders   Various Canadian provinces and territories have also created orders to award their citizens on great deeds: Each province sets up its own rules on how membership in its order is awarded, though there is no rule that Order of Canada members cannot be inducted to provincial and territorial orders. Limitations on the number of provincial order inductions every year by certain provinces has led to this being more common for people from some provinces than from others. An example would be Gordon Lightfoot being a Companion of the Order of Canada and a member of the Order of Ontario (O. Ont.).http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4090. Gordon Lightfoot's C.C. Citation. The Order of Ontario places no limit on the annual number of inductions (although it is usually around 25). The Alberta Order of Excellence is limited to 10 inductees each year. One of the few Albertans to be part of the provincial and Canadian orders is former Prime Minister Joe Clark. It is also possible to be appointed to multiple provincial orders. The late Canadian jazz great Oscar Peterson, who was born in Montreal but resided in Ontario during his later years, was simultaneously a Companion of the Order of Canada, Knight of the National Order of Quebec, and a member of the Order of Ontario. At certain periods, holders of the order were presented with other decorations. These are usually commemorative medals. Thus far, four commemorative medals have been given automatically to every living member of the Order of Canada, or the Canadian Bravery Decorations: Other provincial commemorative medals such as the Alberta Centennial Medal and the Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan require independent nomination. In 2007 it was revealed that one of the first ever issued Orders of Canada, a Medal of Service awarded originally to Quebec poet Gustave Lanctot, was put up for sale via email. Originally, the auctioneer, who had purchased the insignia for $45.00 at an estate sale in Montreal, and who remained anonymous, attempted to sell the insignia on eBay; however, after the bidding reached $15,000, eBay removed the item, citing its policy against the sale of government property, including "any die, seal or stamp provided by, belonging to, or used by a government department, diplomatic or military authority appointed by or acting under the authority of Her Majesty." Rideau Hall stated that selling medals was "highly discouraged," however the owner continued efforts to sell the insignia via the internet.Canadian Press; CTV News: Order of Cda. medal auction to proceed by e-mail; January 6, 2007 Companion Officer Member Ribbon Bar C.C. & O.C.
