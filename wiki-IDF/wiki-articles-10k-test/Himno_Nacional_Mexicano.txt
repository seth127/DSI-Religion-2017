  The National Anthem of Mexico () was officially adopted in 1943.  The lyrics of the national anthem, which allude to Mexican victories in the heat of battle and cries of defending the homeland, were composed by poet Francisco González Bocanegra in 1853, after his fiancée locked him in a room.  In 1854, Jaime Nunó arranged the music which now accompanies González's poem.  The anthem, consisting of ten stanzas and a chorus, entered into use on September 16, 1854.  From 1854 until its official adoption, the lyrics underwent several modifications due to political changes in the country.  Unofficially, the anthem is sometimes called  (Spanish for "Mexicans, at the cry of war") which is also the first line of the chorus.   On November 12, 1853, President Antonio López de Santa Anna announced a competition to write a national anthem for Mexico.  The competition offered a prize for the best poetic composition representing patriotic ideals.  Francisco González Bocanegra, a talented poet, was not interested in participating in the competition. He argued that writing love poems involved very different skills from the ones required to write a national anthem.  His fiancée, Guadalupe González del Pino (or Pili), had undaunted faith in her fiancé's poetic skills and was displeased with his constant refusal to participate in spite of her constant prodding and requests from their friends.  Finally she decided to take matters into her own hands.  Under false pretenses, she lured him to a secluded bedroom in her parents' house, locked him into the room, and refused to let him out until he produced an entry for the competition.  Inside the room in which he was temporarily imprisoned were pictures depicting various events in Mexican history which helped to inspire his work.  After four hours of fluent (albeit forced) inspiration, Francisco regained his freedom by slipping all ten verses of his creation under the door.  After Francisco received approval from his fiancée and her father, he submitted the poem and won the competition by unanimous vote.David Kendall National Anthems—Mexico González was announced the winner in the publication Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) on February 3, 1854. At the same time the lyrics were chosen, a set of music was chosen. The winner was Juan Bottesini, but his entry was disliked due to aesthetics. This rejection caused a second national contest to find music for the lyrics.Embassy of Mexico in Serbia and Montenegro Mexican Symbols—Himo. Retrieved Mar. 19, 2006. At the end of the second contest, the music that was chosen for González's lyrics was composed by Jaime Nunó, a Spanish-born band leader.  At the time of the second anthem competition, Nunó was the leader of several Mexican military bands.  He had been invited to direct these bands by President Santa Anna, whom he had met in Cuba.  About the time that Nunó first came to Mexico to start performing with the bands, Santa Anna was making his announcement about creating a national anthem for Mexico.  Out of the few musical compositions submitted, Nunó's music, titled "God and Freedom" (Dios y libertad), was chosen as the winner on August 12, 1854.President of the Republic—National Anthem for Kids.

An urban legend about the copyright status of the anthem states that years after its first performance, Nunó's family sold the musical rights to a German music publishing company named Wagner House.  Originally, Nunó was supposed to have turned the music rights over to the state in exchange for a prize from the Mexican government.

The country felt demoralized and also divided, due to the loss of nearly half of its territory to the United States.  According to historian Javier Garciadiego, who spoke at a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the anthem's adoption, the anthem disregards divisions and strife and encourages national unity.  Also, during the celebration in 2004, Mexico City and other parts of the country stopped what they were doing and performed a nationwide singing of the anthem.  Individuals from other nations participated, mostly at diplomatic offices or at locations where a high concentration of Mexican expatriates are found.  The anthem has also been described as one of the symbols of the "Mexican identity". On the rare occasions when someone performs the anthem incorrectly, the federal government has been known to impose penalties to maintain the "dignity" of the national symbols.
