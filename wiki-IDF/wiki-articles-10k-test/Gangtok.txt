  Gangtok  (Tibetan: སྒངཐོག)  (Nepali/Hindi: गंगटोक)  is the capital and largest town of the Indian state of Sikkim.  It is situated in the lower Himalayas.  Known for its clean surroundings and temperate climate, this hill station of about thirty thousand people is the centre of Sikkim's tourist industry. Gangtok was a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center.  It became a major stopover between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.  Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim became a nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok remaining its capital. The precise meaning of the name Gangtok is unclear, though it is generally held to mean "lofty hill".  Gangtok is also a centre of Tibetan Buddhist culture and learning with numerous monasteries and religious educational institutions.  Not much is known about the early history of Gangtok. The earliest records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center.  After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century. Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time. In 1894, Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from Tumlong to Gangtok, increasing its importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim became a nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim became a suzerain of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the Nathula and Jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient Silk Road near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.

The city overlooks the Ranikhola in the valley below. Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them. The peaks of the snow-clad Himalayan range, including the world's third tallest peak, the Kanchenjunga, can be seen to the east of the city. Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, temperate climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, monsoons, autumn, winter and spring.

During this season the weather can be sporadic, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours. During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild.  Owing to its elevation, Gangtok is often enveloped in fog during the monsoon and winter months.  Between June and September (the monsoon months), the rain often causes landslides in the area.  The lower Himalayas in general are composed of labile rock formations and therefore prone to landslides even in dry seasons.
