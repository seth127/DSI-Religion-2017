    Baghdad ( ) is the capital of Iraq and of Baghdad Governorate. With a metropolitan area estimated at a population of 7,000,000, it is the largest city in Iraq. It is the second-largest city in the Arab World (after Cairo) and the second-largest city in southwest Asia (after Tehran). Located on the Tigris River, the city dates back to at least the 8th century, and probably to pre-Islamic times. Once the center of Dar al-salam, the Muslim world, Baghdad has been a center of violent conflict since 2003 because of the ongoing Iraq War. Although there is no dispute over its Iranian origin,Page 563 of the First Encyclopaedia of Islam edited by M. Th. (Martijn Theodor) Houtsma there have been several rival proposals as to its specific etymology. The most reliable and most widely accepted among these is that the name is a Middle Persian compound of Bag "god" + dād "given", translating to "god-given" or "God's gift", whence Modern Persian , Arabic . Another leading proposal is that the name comes from Middle Persian Bāgh-dād "The Given Garden".  Baghdad was around before the time of Hammurabi ,  It is mentioned in a document from Hammurabi’s time and there is also more than just that one reference to it.  It has different meanings in both Aramaic  and Persian.  The name is pre-Islamic and the origins are unclear, but it is related to previous settlements, which did not have any political or commercial power, making it a virtually new foundation in the time of the Abbasids  Encyclopaedia of Islam pg. 895 .   Mansur called the city “Madinah al-Salam”, or “City of Peace”, as a reference to paradise  Unus, Nada “Baghdad” .   This was the official name on coins, weights, and other things. Founding of Baghdad Baghdad is a city within Iraq that is near the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. In 764 CE, the caliph Mansur founded the city  “Yakut: Baghdad under the Abbasids, c. 1000CE”.  Davis Press. Ed. By Paul Halsall, July 1998. .  Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic empire under the Abbasids. Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying, “This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward".  Wiet, Gastron. Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate.  Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1971.   This transformation of Baghdad to the capital city contained all necessary conditions for the security and development of a political and economic capital, mostly because the location gave it control over strategic and commercial routes. Also, it was a trade route for the Khurasans where caravans met and traded.  Monthly fairs for trading were also held in this area. Another reason why Baghdad provided an excellent location was due to the abundance of water and its healthy climate. Water exists on both north and south ends of the city gates, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was very uncommon during this time. Baghdad came into its prime about 800CE during the reign of the caliph Harun-al-Rashid.   Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Persian Empire, which was located some 30 km (20 miles) to the southeast, which had been under Muslim control since 637, and which became quickly deserted after the foundation of Baghdad. The site of Babylon, which had been deserted since the 2nd century BC, lies some 90 km (55 miles) to the south. The Making of Baghdad In its beginning years the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the Koran, when it refers to Paradise  Wiet, pg. 13 .   In the year 758 CE, Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers come to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the grand city. The construction started in July 23, 762 CE; the framework of the city itself is two large semicircles about twelve miles in diameter. July was chosen as the starting time because two astronomers, Naubaknt and Mashallah, believed that the city should be built under the sign of the lion, Leo  Wiet, pg. 12 .  Leo is significant because he is the element of fire and symbolizes productivity, proud ness, and expansion. The bricks used to make the city were 18” on all four sides. Abu Hanifa was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal, which brought water to the work site for the use of both human consumption and the manufacturing of the bricks. Also, throughout the city marble was used to make the buildings and marble steps led down to the river’s edge. Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and beautiful promenades which gave the city an elegant and classy finish  “Yakut: Baghdad under the Abbasids, c. 1000CE” .   The city was designed as a circle about 2 km in diameter, leading it to be known as the "Round City". The original design shows a ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring, inside the first.http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm In the center of the city lay the mosque, as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Persian Sasanian urban design. The ancient Sasanian city of Gur/Firouzabad is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the center of the city. The Surrounding Wall The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named Kufa, Basra, Khurasan, and Syria; these names were given to the gates because they granted access to these destinations  Wiet, pg. 14 .  The distance between these gates was a little less than a mile and a half. Each gate had double doors that were made of iron, because the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall, itself, was about 145 feet thick at the base and about 39 feet thick at the top. Also, the wall was 98 feet high, which included the merlons, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by embrasures. This wall was surrounded by another impressive wall that consisted of 165 feet and was extremely thick.  The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by solid glacis, which is made out of bricks and quicklime. Beyond the outer wall was a water filled moat  Weit, pg. 14 . Golden Gate Palace In the middle of Baghdad, in the central square was the Golden Gate Palace. The Palace was the residence of the caliph and his family. In the central part of the building was a green dome that was 160 feet high. On top of this dome was a horseman holding a lamp. This horseman was believed to have magical powers that leaving a mysterious presence to visitors of the caliph. Surrounding the palace was an esplanade, a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer’s residences. Near the Gate of Syria a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of the caliph Amin the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family  Wiet, pg. 15 .     The roundness points to the fact that it was based on Persian precedents such as Firouzabad in Persia.See: The Abbasids and the Round City The Abbasid Caliphate was based on them being the descendants of the uncle of Muhammad and being part of the Quraysh tribe.  They used Shi’a resentment, Khurasanian movement, and appeals to the ambitions and traditions of the newly conquered Persian aristocracy to overthrow the Umayyads  Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 78 .     The Abbasids sought to combine the hegemony of the Arabic tribes with the imperial court ceremonial and administrative structures of the Persians.  The Abbasids considered themselves the inheritors of two traditions: the Arabian-Islamic (bearers of the mantle of Muhammad) and the Persian (successors to the Sassanid monarchs).  These two things are evident from the construction, which is modeled after Persian structures and the need of Mansur to place the capital in a place that was representative of Arab-Islamic identity by building the House of Wisdom, where ancient texts were translated from their original language, such as Greek, to Arabic. Mansur is responsible for the “Translation Movement” for this.  The Persian structures are exemplified in how the city was built: round, which is why it is called the “Round City”.  It is also near the ancient Sassanid imperial seat of Ctesiphon on the Tigris River  Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 79 . The End of the Abbasids in Baghdad The Seljuqs were a clan of the Oghuz Turks from the Siberian steppes that converted to theSunni branch of Islam.  In 1040, they destroyed the Ghaznavids, taking over their land and in 1055, Tughril Beg, the leader of the Seljuqs, took over Baghdad. The Seljuqs expelled the Buyids dynasty of Shiites that ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad.  They ruled as Sultans in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime) Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs  Atlas of the Medieval World pg. 170 .  On February 10, 1258, Baghdad was invaded by theMongols led by Hulegu, a grandson of Chingiz Khan. Caliph al-Mustasim made an unconditional surrender, and people were killed indiscriminately for over a week.  Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting.  The Abbasids fled to Cairo where they were installed as caliphs there by the Mamluks, although they were not widely recognized outside the Mamluk territories  The Formation of Islam, Jonathan P. Berkey pg. 182 .  Within a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of learning and commerce. The House of Wisdom was an establishment dedicated to the translation of Greek, Middle Persian and Syriac works. Scholars headed to Baghdad from all over the Abbasid empire, facilitating the introduction of Greek and Indian science into the Arabic and Islamic world at that time.  Baghdad was likely the largest city in the world from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it was tied by Córdoba.Largest Cities Through History Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak.Matt T. Rosenberg, Largest Cities Through History. Many of the One Thousand and One Nights tales are set in Baghdad during this period. A portion of the population of Baghdad were non-Arabs such as Persians, Arameans  and Greeks. These communities gradually adapted Arabic language.  By the 10th century, the city's population was between 300,000 and 500,000. Baghdad's early meteoric growth slowed due to troubles within the Caliphate, including relocations of the capital to Samarra (during 808&ndash;819 and 836&ndash;892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the Iranian Buwayhids (945&ndash;1055) and Seljuk Turks (1055&ndash;1135). Nevertheless, the city remained one of the cultural and commercial hubs of the Islamic world until February 10 1258, when it was sacked by the Mongols under Hulagu Khan during the sack of Baghdad. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta'sim, and destroyed large sections of the city. The canals and dykes forming the city's irrigation system were also destroyed. The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate, a blow from which the Islamic civilization never fully recovered. At this point Baghdad was ruled by the Il-Khanids, the Mongol emperors of Iran. In 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by Timur ("Tamerlane"). It became a provincial capital controlled by the Jalayirid (1400&ndash;1411), Qara Quyunlu (1411&ndash;1469), Aq Quyunlu (1469&ndash;1508), and Safavid (1508&ndash;1534) dynasties.  In 1534, Baghdad was conquered by the Ottoman Turks. Under the Ottomans, Baghdad fell into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Persia. For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century under the Mamluk rule. The Nuttall Encyclopedia reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000. Baghdad remained under Ottoman rule until the establishment of the kingdom of Iraq under British control in 1921. British control was established by a systematic suppression of Iraqi Arab and Kurdish national aspirations. Iraq was given formal independence in 1932, and increased autonomy in 1946. In 1958 the Iraqi Army deposed the grandson of the British-installed monarch, Faisal II. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950 of which 140,000 were Jewish.  During the 1970s Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the price of petroleum, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. However, the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money flowed into the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad, although they caused relatively little damage and few casualties.  In 1991 the Persian Gulf War caused damage to Baghdad's transportation, power, and sanitary infrastructure. Baghdad was bombed very heavily in March and April 2003 in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and fell under US control by April 7-April 9. Additional damage was caused by the severe looting during the days following the end of the war. With the deposition of Saddam Hussein's regime, the city was occupied by U.S. troops. The Coalition Provisional Authority established a three-square-mile (8 km²) "Green Zone" within the heart of the city from which it governed Iraq during the period before the new Iraqi government was established. The Coalition Provisional Authority ceded power to the interim government at the end of June 2004 and dissolved itself.Rajiv Chandrasekaran, in his book "Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone (Vintage Books 2006) cites the day as June 28, 2004 at 10:00 AM with Viceroy Bremer declaring it so and handing documents to that affect to Prime Minster Ayad Allawi two days before the announced date of June 30th. (p.329)  On September 23 2003, a Gallup poll indicated that about two-thirds of Baghdad residents said that the removal of the Iraqi leader was worth the hardships they encountered, and that they expected a better life in five years' time. As time passed, however, support for the occupation declined dramatically. In April 2004, USA Today reported that a follow-up Gallup poll in Baghdad indicated that "only 13 percent of the people now say the invasion of Iraq was morally justifiable. In the 2003 poll, more than twice that number saw it as the right thing to do."USATODAY.com - Poll: Iraqis out of patience Most residents of Baghdad became impatient with the United States because essential services such as electricity were still unreliable more than a year after the invasion. In the hot summer of 2004, electricity was only available intermittently in most areas of the city. An additional pressing concern was the lack of security. The curfew imposed immediately after the invasion had been lifted in the winter of 2003, but the city that had once had a vibrant night life was still considered too dangerous after dark for many citizens. Those dangers included kidnapping and the risk of being caught in fighting between security forces and insurgents. On 10th April 2007, the United States military began construction of a three mile (5 km) long 3.5 metre tall wall around the Sunni district of Baghdad (Guardian). On 23rd April , the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki, called for construction to be halted on the wall (Guardian) (BBC). The city of Baghdad is largely Shia city (about 60% of the city's population), a smaller Sunni population, and a very small Christian, Sabeaa and Yazeedi minorities .The Gulf/2000 Project - SIPA - COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the Tigris River. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the Eastern half being called 'Risafa' and the Western half known as 'Karkh'. The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of alluvial origin due to the periodic large floods which have occurred on the river. Baghdad has a hot arid climate (Koppen climate classification BWh) and is, in terms of maximum temperatures, one of the hottest cities in the world. In the summer from June to August, the average maximum temperature is as high as 44 °C (111 °F) accompanied by blazing sunshine: rainfall is almost completely unknown at this time of year. Temperatures exceeding 50 °C (122 °F) in the shade are by no means unheard of, and even at night temperatures in summer are seldom below 24 °C (75 °F) Though the humidity is very low (usually under 10%) due to Baghdad's distance from the marshy Persian Gulf, dust storms from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer. In the winter, from December to February, by contrast, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging 15 to 16 °C (59 to 61 °F). Minima can indeed be very cold: the average January minimum is around 4 °C (39 °F) but temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) are not uncommon during this season. Annual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November to March, averages around 140&nbsp;millimetres (5.5 in), but has been as high as 575 millimetres (23&nbsp;in) and as low as 23 millimetres (~1&nbsp;in). On January 11th of 2008, light snow fell across Baghdad for the first time in memory, causing temperatures to fall below zero degrees Centigrade (32 degrees Fahrenheit).Afp.google.com, First snow for 100 years falls on Baghdad  Most Reconstruction of Iraq efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged infrastructure of the city. More visible efforts at reconstruction through private development, such as architect and urban designer Hisham N. Ashkouri's Baghdad Renaissance Plan and Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center garnered early interest, but remain undeveloped due to the instability of the region.ARCADD The City of Baghdad has 89 official neighborhoods within 9 districts. These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in the official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses. CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings. Each neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them. Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood’s population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council.  The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the City itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the City, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The final step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad  Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February, 2004 and served until National elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome but Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 74,000 people. The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows [ ]:   Baghdad has always played an important role in Arab cultural life and has been the home of noted writers, musicians and visual artists. The dialect of Arabic spoken in Baghdad today differs from that of other large urban centers in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Verseegh, The Arabic Language).  It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sacks of the late Middle Ages. Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include: The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions.In Baghdad, Art Thrives As War Hovers Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include the Academy of Music, Institute of Fine Arts and the Music and Ballet School. Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed artifacts and relics of ancient civilizations; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after U.S. forces entered the city. During the 2003 occupation of Iraq, AFN Iraq ("Freedom Radio") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called "Dijlah" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the Jamia neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions. [ ]    Points of interest include the National Museum of Iraq whose priceless collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 invasion the iconic Hands of Victory arches which have been a contentious issue as to their continued presence multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions as to whether they should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled.  Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed when the building burnt down during the 2003 invasion of Iraq The Al Kadhimain Shrines in the northwest of Baghdad (in Kadhimiya) is one of the most important Shi'ite religious buildings in Iraq. It was finished in 1515 and the 7th (Musa ibn Jafar al-Kathim) and the 9th Imams (Mohammad al-Jawad) were buried here. One of the oldest buildings is the 12th century or 13th century Abbasid Palace. The palace is part of the central historical area of the city and close to other historically important buildings such as the Saray Building and Al-Mustansiriyah School (From the Abbasid Period). There are other landmarks in Baghdad, each of them marks a certain era and has become associated with memorable events or even just changes that marked the city scape. Here are some of them: Baghdad Zoo was the biggest zoo in the Middle East; however, by 8 days after the 2003 invasion, out of 650 to 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo only 35 survived owing to bombing of the zoo, looting of the animals for food, and starvation of the caged animals without food and water.  The animals that survived were some of the larger animals, including bears, lions and tigers.  In the chaos of the war, the South African, Lawrence Anthony with some of the zoo keepers looked after the animals, and fed the carnivores by buying donkeys.  Eventually, Bremer supported the zoo and American engineers helped to reopen the zoo. Baghdad is home to some of the most successful football teams in Iraq, the biggest being Al Quwa Al Jawiya (Airforce club), Al Zawra, Al Shurta (Police) and Al Talaba (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is Al Shaab Stadium which was opened in 1966. Another. Much larger stadium, are still in the opening stages of construction. The city has also had a strong tradition of horse racing ever since World War I, known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.
