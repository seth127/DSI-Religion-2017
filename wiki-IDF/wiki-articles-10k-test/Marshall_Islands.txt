  The Marshall Islands, officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), is a Micronesian island nation in the western Pacific Ocean, located north of Nauru and Kiribati, east of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the U.S. territory of Wake Island, to which it lays claim.  Although they were settled by Micronesians in the 2nd millennium BC, little is known of the early history of the islands. Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar was the first European to sight the Marshall Islands in 1526, but the islands remained virtually unvisited by Europeans for several more centuries, before the arrival of British Captain John Marshall in 1788; the islands owe their name to him.  A German trading company settled on the islands in 1885, and they became part of the protectorate of German New Guinea some years later. Japan conquered the islands in World War I, and administered them as a League of Nations mandate. In World War II, the United States occupied the islands (1944), and they were added to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (including several more island groups in the South Sea). Between 1946 and 1958 the United States tested 66 nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands,"Nuclear Weapons Test Map", Public Broadcasting Service including the largest nuclear test the United States ever conducted, Castle Bravo. Nuclear claims between the United States and the Marshall Islands are ongoing, and health effects still linger from these tests. (See Rongelap.) In 1979 the Government of the Marshall Islands was officially established and the country became self-governing.  In 1986 the Compact of Free Association with the United States entered into force, granting the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) its sovereignty.  The Compact provided for aid and U.S. defense of the islands in exchange for continued U.S. military use of the missile testing range at Kwajalein Atoll. The independence was formally completed under international law in 1990, when the UN officially ended the Trusteeship status. On March 21 2007, the government of the Marshall Islands declared a state of emergency after water ran out amid a prolonged drought.   The government of the Marshall Islands operates under a mixed parliamentary-presidential system. Elections are held every four years in universal suffrage (for all citizens above 18 years of age) with each of the twenty-four constituencies (see below) electing one or more representatives (senators) to the lower house of RMI’s bicameral legislature, the Nitijela. (Majuro, the capital atoll, elects five senators.) The President, who is head of state as well as head of government, is elected in his turn by the 33 senators of the Nitijela. Legislative power lies with the Nitijela. The upper house of Parliament, called the Council of Iroij,  is an advisory body comprising twelve tribal chiefs. The executive branch consists of the President and the Presidential Cabinet (ten ministers appointed by the President with the approval of the Nitijela.) The twenty-four electoral districts into which the country is divided correspond to the inhabited islands and atolls: There are currently three political parties in the Marshall Islands:  AKA, UPP & UDP.  The ruling party is combined of both the AKA and UPP.   The country consists of twenty-nine atolls and five isolated islands. The most important atolls and islands form two groups: the Ratak Chain and the Ralik Chain (meaning "sunrise" and "sunset" chains). Two-thirds of the nation's population lives on Majuro (which is also the capital) and Ebeye.  The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development.  Life on the outer atolls is generally still fairly traditional, and the nutrition of the rural population, consuming food that is either grown or caught, is superior to that of most of the urban residents, who rely considerably on white rice.  A majority of the islands' land mass is at sea level. The uninhabited atolls are:   The climate is hot and humid, with a wet season from May to November. The islands occasionally suffer from typhoons.  Many Pacific typhoons start in the Marshall Islands region and grow stronger as they move west toward the Mariana Islands and the Philippines. The Marshall Islands also lays claim to Wake Island, administered by the United States, under the name Enen-kio.  United States government assistance is the mainstay of the economy. Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for future added income. The islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1999 a private company constructed a tuna loining plant, which employed upwards of 400 people, mostly women.  The plant was closed in 2005, following a failed attempt to convert it from  producing tuna loins to tuna steaks, (a fiction developed by individuals in the government interested in taking over the operations) a process that requires only half of the employee base. The owners attempted to partner with the government to prevent the closure of the plant which was due to processing costs of the plant exceeding the price paid to the plant to loin the tuna. Officials of the government interested in an economic stake in the plant as individuals refused to assist and as the guarantor of a $2 million loan to the business, the government took control of the plant facility following its closure, and effectively shut down the only viable industry to ever exist in the Marshall Islands. In 2005 Aloha Airlines canceled its flight services to the Marshall Islands as part of its withdrawal from several markets in the region. Though other international airlines still serve Majuro, the Aloha decision was a setback in the country's hopes of increased revenues from tourism. Under the terms of the Amended Compact of Free Association, the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2023, at which time a trust fund made up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts. Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, the decline in tourism and foreign investment due to Asian financial difficulties, and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1% over the past decade. The 2007 edition of "Doing Business," prepared by the World Bank's private sector development department, has declared the Marshall Islands to be the world's "Best Performer" for its ease and low expense in hiring and firing employees. By the same token, the same study gave the Marshall Islands extremely low ratings for its protection of investors and contract enforcement. Not being among the 179 member countries of the ILO, the Marshall Islands is among the handful of countries not obliged to abide by the core labour standards (elimination of forced labour, child labour and discrimination, and respect for freedom of association and right to collective bargaining) as required of ILO members. The United States maintains the U.S. Army's Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll.  It is important for the local economy, as the Marshallese land owners receive rent for the base, and a large number of Marshallese work at the base. Majuro Atoll also benefited from foreign assistance. The main airport was built by the Japanese during World War II, and the only tarmac road of the capital was built partly by the Taiwanese and partly by the Americans. On September 15, 2007, Witon Barry, of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro said  power authorities, private companies and entrepreneurs had been experimenting with coconut oil as alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators and ships. Coconut trees abound in the Pacific's tropical islands. Copra, from 6 to 10 coconuts makes 1 litre oil.Afp.google.com, Pacific Islands look to coconut power to fuel future growth  The Marshallese are of Micronesian origin and migrated from Asia several thousand years ago. Although English is an official language and is spoken widely, though not fluently, Marshallese is used by the government. Japanese is also occasionally spoken in some areas of Marshall Islands. Virtually all Marshallese are Christian, most of them Protestant. The Marshall Islands has the highest rate of leprosy in the world.http://www.spc.int/prism/country/mh/stats/Social/Health/Diseases.htm  Although now in decline, the Marshallese were once able navigators, using the stars and stick and shell charts. They are also experienced in canoe building and still hold annual competitions involving the unique oceanic sailing canoe, the proa.
