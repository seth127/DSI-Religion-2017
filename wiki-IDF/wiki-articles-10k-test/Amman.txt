     Amman (), sometimes spelled Ammann (Arabic عمان ʿAmmān), is the capital city of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, a city of 2,125,400 inhabitants (2005 estimate), and the administrative capital and commercial center of Jordan. It is the capital city of Amman Governorate. Throughout history, Amman has been inhabited by several civilizations. The first civilization on record is during the Neolithic period, around 8500 BC, when archaeological discoveries in 'Ain Ghazal, located in eastern Amman, showed evidence of not only a settled life but also the growth of artistic work, which suggests that a well-developed civilization inhabited the city at that time. In the 13th century BC Amman was called Rabbath Ammon or Rabat Amon by the Ammonites (רַבַּת עַמּוֹן, Standard Hebrew Rabbat ʿAmmon, Tiberian Hebrew Rabbaṯ ʿAmmôn). It was later conquered by the Assyrians, followed by the Persians, and then the Greeks.  Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Hellenic ruler of Egypt, renamed it Philadelphia. The city became part of the Nabataean kingdom until AD 106 when Philadelphia came under Roman control and joined the Decapolis. In 324 AD, Christianity became the religion of the empire and Philadelphia became the seat of a bishopric during the beginning of the Byzantine era.  One of the churches of this period can be seen on the city's Citadel. Philadelphia was renamed Amman during the Ghassanian era, and flourished under the Caliphates (with nearby capital) of the Umayyads (in Damascus) and the Abbasids (in Baghdad). It was then destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters and remained a small village and a pile of ruins until the Circassians settlement in 1887. The tide changed when the Ottoman Sultan decided to build the Hejaz railway, linking Damascus and Medina, facilitating both the annual haj pilgrimage and permanent trade, putting Amman, a major station, back on the commercial map. In 1921, Abdullah I chose Amman as seat of government for his newly-created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, and later as the capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  As there was no palatial building, he started his reign from the station, with his office in a train car.  Amman remained a small city until 1948, when the population expanded considerably due to an influx of Palestinian refugees from the occupied territories. Amman has experienced exceptionally rapid development since 1952 under the leadership of two Hashemite Kings, Hussein of Jordan and Abdullah II of Jordan. In 1970, Amman was the site of major clashes between the PLO and the Jordanian army.  Everything around the Royal Palace sustained heavy damage from shelling.  Most of Amman suffered great damage from PLO rockets and the Jordanian army's shells. The city's population continues to expand at a dizzying pace (fueled by refugees escaping the wartime events in the occupied territories and Iraq). The city received refugees from these countries on a number of occasions.  The first wave of Palestinian refugees arrived from the occupied territories in 1948.  A second wave after the Six Day War in 1967.  A third wave of Palestinian and Jordanian and South East Asians, working as domestic servants, refugees arrived in Amman from Kuwait after the Gulf War of 1991.  The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the first Gulf War.  A second wave also began arriving after the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003.  During the last 10 years the amount of new building within the city has increased dramatically with new districts of the city being founded at a very rapid pace (particularly so in West Amman), straining the very scarce water supplies of Jordan as a whole, and exposing Amman to the hazards of rapid expansion in the absence of careful municipal planning. On November 9, 2005, coordinated explosions rocked three hotels in Amman, shocking and angering the population of the peaceful city.  The Islamist organization, Al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility. Despite the fact that the birthplace of since-killed terrorist leader Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi is the town of Zarqa, less than 30 km from Amman. The sheer brutality of the attacks — they targeted, among other things, a Muslim wedding procession — caused widespread revulsion across the widest range of Jordanians. Amman is located in a hilly area of north-western Jordan.  The city was originally built on seven hills, but it now spans over an area of nineteen hills (each known as a jabal or "mountain").  The main areas of Amman gain their names from the hills and mountains on whose slopes they lie. Because of the cooling effects of its location on a plateau (a flat area of land), Amman enjoys four seasons of excellent weather as compared to other places in the region. Summer temperatures range from 28 - 35 degrees Celsius (82 &ndash; 95 °F), but with very low humidity and frequent breezes. Spring and fall temperatures are extremely pleasant and mild. The winter sees nighttime temperatures frequently near zero, and snow is known in Amman, as a matter of fact it usually snows a couple of times per year. The yearly average number of days with rain is 5-45 and with snow it is 0-8.It typically will not rain from June to the beginning of September, with cloudy and blue skies prevailing. But lately it is starting to rain in April and the beginning of May. In fact about half the quantity of rain Amman and Jordan received in 2006 fell in April. The city's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is situated about 30 minutes south of Amman and hosts the majority of the air travel to and from the country. It has three terminals; two passenger terminals and one cargo terminal.  The airport handled almost 4 million passengers in 2007.  Its serves as the Kingdom's hub of international travel, it serves and handles the bulk of most visitors arriving. There is expansion going on that will add another terminal, valued at over six hundred million, that will allow the airport to handle over 9 million passengers.  A new rail line being constructed will connect Queen Alia International Airport with Raghadan, Mahatta, and Zarqa.  Taxis and buses serve the airport 24/7. Marka Airport is a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the military. The Hejaz Railway is a century old rail line that was used primarily for pilgrims to reach the holy city of Mecca and Medina but now the rail line is basically used by tourists.  There are new projects that are being built to add more railines in the Kingdom, most of which will go through Amman. Amman has a very extensive highway system that links  every part of the city to one another.  There are eight circles that one could use to go from one section of Amman to another.  However, the city lacks an operable rail or metro system which causes severe traffic throughout the city, especially in old Amman where its narrow streets cannot handle that many people.  To even add on traffic congestion, all the Kingdom's highways pass through Amman some way or another even intensifying traffic.  Buses and taxis are available as well but a rail network must be implemented soon. By land, the city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis.  Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis.  Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The main two bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and Raghadan (near the Roman Amphitheater in Downtown). The city can suffer from considerable traffic congestion at peak hours, especially during summer months when affluent vacationers from the Gulf region summer in Amman to take advantage of its relatively mild weather.  All major highways in Jordan pass through Amman as well. Amman is a regional hub in the communications, transportation, medical tourism, education, and investment.  All business dealings with Iraq flow through Amman in some way.  Its airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is the hub of the national carrier, Royal Jordanian, which is a major airline in the region.  Amman is a major tourist attraction in the country because most of the countries foreign tourists arrive in Jordan through Amman.  Its construction boom is helping the real estate economy boom and its banking and finance sectors are also feeling the results of this massive economic growth in Jordan. All major highways of Jordan cross in Amman making the capital busy with freight trucks, buses and cars passing through the city. Amman has both a modern and historic touch.  Old Amman is filled with suqs, or bazaars, small shops, and single family dwellings all crowded together. New Amman, however, is less crowded and more scenic.  Parks and wide boulevards with towering apartment and office buildings dominate the scene.  Most of the city's 5-star and 4-star hotels are located here as well.   Villas and expensive apartment complexes are very common.  Most of Amman's foreign business flows through here.  Shmeisani, the main economic center of Amman, and Abdoun, the up-scale residential district, are the two main areas of "New Amman" much different from the overly crowded Jabal al-Qalat in Old Amman. Amman is currently experiencing rapid growth that is reshaping the ancient city into a commercial hub. New projects and proposals in and around the city include: These projects, along with the boom in the Jordanian real estate market and the construction of many other smaller projects, is resulting in a huge boom in terms of development, both in the city of Amman and in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan as a whole. Amman is home to many diverse religious sects making up the two primary religions of Jordan, Islam and Christianity.  Numerous mosques and churches dot the capital.  The most famous mosque of Amman is the King Abduallah I Mosque which can house almost 3,000 people. Most of the people in Jordan are muslims (90%) and 5% christians. The Jordan Media City, established in 2001, is the first of its kind in the region which plans to make Jordan the regional hub of communications.  It now transmits over 120 channels and still grows.   Although not as popualar as Beirut or Cairo, many Jordanian singers work out of Amman. Much of Amman's tourism is focused in the older downtown area, which is centered around the old Souk (a colorful traditional market) and the King Hussein Mosque. The downtown area (known locally as the Balad) has been completely dwarfed by the sprawling urban areas that surround it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. For those seeking the atmosphere of the Old City, it is best to venture to the district east of Jabal Amman. There, in the bustle of daily life, you can explore the capital's greatest souqs, fine museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites. The Citadel hill of Amman, known as Jabal el Qala, has been inhabited for centuries, important as a military and religious site. It dates back to Roman and Byzantine times, and later work was carried out in the early Islamic era. Remains unearthed at the northern and eastern ends of the Citadel, possibly date back to the Bronze Age. The Citadel also is home to the Temple of Hercules which is said to have been constructed under the Roman imperial ruler Marcus Aurelius who reigned from AD 161-180, is similar to the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus. Since Amman resembles Rome, as it is situated on seven hills, the city was a favorite place for Roman soldiers and officials. Behind the Roman forum stands a Roman theatre&mdash;the largest theatre in Jordan&mdash;with room for 6,000 spectators. Thought to have been built between AD 138 and AD 161 by the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, it is constructed into the side of the mountain and is still used for sport displays and cultural events. Amman is also home to some of the grandest mosques in the Middle East, although they compare less favorably to the ones to be found in Istanbul, Turkey. The newest of these is the enormous King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a magnificent blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The most unusual mosque in Amman is the Abu Darweesh Mosque atop Jabal Ashrafieh (the highest point in the city). It is covered with an extraordinary black and white checkered pattern and is unique to Jordan. It is striking and visible from quite some distance. In contrast, the interior is totally free of the black and white scheme. Instead, there are light colored walls and Persian carpets. This religious building was erected by one of Amman's Circassian immigrants. Amman is also home to many jewelers and souvenir shops for citizens and tourists alike.  Most of Amman is well paved and nicely renovated.  A new phase in Eastern Amman, the oldest part of the city, will repaint and renovate broken down building and build kiosks and street maps all over to the city to make touring Amman much easier for tourists.  Amman is also a major destination for  foreign students seeking study in Arabic.  Amman's world-class hospitals are frequent destinations for those who seek medical treatment. A new construction phase in Abdali will transform downtown Amman into a more desirable place for investment.  The new development is mostly for business purposes and the rest are residential hi-rises and shopping centers.  Office buildings and a new boulevard containing easy access to malls, restaurants, hotels, and residential buildings.  This 1.5 billion dollar construction plan should be completed by 2010. Unfortunately, a lone deranged gunman attacked Western tourists during a guided trip to the downtown Roman theatre in September 2006, shooting five of them, one fatally. The man was immediately apprehended, and claimed to have acted in response to the fighting between Israel and Lebanon during the prior months. Despite this attack, tourism in Amman continues on a daily basis, and the city's tourist locations are generally well-policed. Given Jordan's location in a region that sees frequent conflict and violence, by statistics and by general mood, Amman remains a safe and interesting place to visit. For example, despite this killing, there is little or no violent or petty crime in Amman, especially against visitors, who uniformly report feeling safe at all hours in practically all locations in the city. Shopping is continually becoming more popular in Jordanian culture and is very notable in the past five years, with huge mega malls across Amman popping up such as Mecca Mall, Abdoun Mall, Amman Mall, City Mall and Plaza Mall. These Malls all carry label names helping attracting tourists. Amman is conveniently located for many Jordanian attractions favoured by tourists.  It is a mere 45 minute trip by car to several interesting locations: 2002 picture of Central Amman (downtown) Abu Darweesh Mosque Amman cityscape at night A Coptic Church is an example of Amman's religious diversity A night view of Khelda, West End of Amman An overview of East Amman.
