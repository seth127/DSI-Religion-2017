   Texas A&M University, often called A&M or TAMU, is a coeducational public research university located in College Station, Texas. It is the flagship institution of the Texas A&M University System. It opened in 1876 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, the first public institution of higher education in that state. In 1963, the Texas Legislature renamed the school to Texas A&M University to reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings. The letters "A&M" no longer have any explicit meaning but are retained as a link to the university's past. The nickname "Aggie" refers to students, alumni, and sports teams of Texas A&M. Texas A&M's designation as a land, sea, and space grant institution reflects a broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research. Working with agencies such as the Texas AgriLife Research and Texas AgriLife Extension Service, Texas A&M has a direct presence in each of the 254 counties in Texas. The university offers degrees in over 150 courses of study through ten colleges and houses 18 research institutes. Texas A&M has awarded over 320,000 degrees, including 70,000 graduate and professional degrees. As a Senior Military College, Texas A&M is one of three public universities with a full-time, volunteer Corps of Cadets. It provides more commissioned officers to the United States Armed Forces than any other school outside of the service academies.       The Texas Legislature established Texas A&M in 1871 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, then known as Texas A.M.C. The U.S. Congress funded the new land-grant college, the state's first public institution of higher education, through the Morrill Act in 1862. The act auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges where the "leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life". A state committee established Texas A&M in Brazos County, which donated  near Bryan, Texas. Classes began on October 4, 1876 with 40 students and 6 faculty members. With mandatory Corps of Cadets participation and military training, enrollment climbed to 258 students before declining to 108 students in 1883, the year the University of Texas opened in Austin, Texas. Though originally envisioned as a component of the University of Texas System, Texas A.M.C. had a separate Board of Directors from the University of Texas. In the late 1880s, many Texas residents saw no need for two colleges in Texas and clamored for an end of Texas A.M.C. In 1891, Texas A&M was saved from potential closure by its new president Lawrence Sullivan Ross, former governor of Texas and well-respected Confederate Brigadier General. Ross made many improvements to the school and enrollment doubled to 467 cadets as parents sent their sons to Texas A&M "to learn to be like Ross". Upon his death in 1898, a statue was erected in front of what is now Academic Plaza to honor Ross and his achievements in the history of the school. Many Texas A&M graduates served during World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I. By 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, more than any other school. In early September 1918, the entire senior class enlisted, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later. Over 1,200&nbsp;former students served as commissioned officers. After the war, Texas A&M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science. Many Aggies again served in the military during World War II, with the college producing 20,229 combat troops. Of those, 14,123 Aggies served as officers, more than the combined total of the United States Naval Academy and the United States Military Academy. Twenty-nine of its graduates reached the rank of general. Shortly after the war, in 1948, the state Legislature officially recognized Texas A&M as a separate university system from the University of Texas System. The school's Board of Directors continued to oversee the system. On March 26, 1960, Major General James Earl Rudder, class of 1932, became the 16th president of the college. During his tenure, the school desegregated, began to admit women, and Corps of Cadets membership became voluntary. By his death in 1970, Rudder had overseen the growth of the school from 7,500 to 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations. The 58th Legislature of Texas approved of Rudder's changes, and officially renamed the school from "The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas" to "Texas A&M University", and specified that, the "A" and the "M" were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for "Agricultural and Mechanical". In the following 35&nbsp;years, Texas A&M more than tripled its enrollment from 14,000&nbsp;students to over 45,000. Texas A&M became one of the first four universities given the designation sea-grant for its achievements in oceanography and marine resources development in 1971. In 1989, the university earned the title space-grant by NASA, to recognize its commitment to space research and participation in the Texas Space Grant Consortium.  In 1997, the school was further honored with the establishment of the George Bush Presidential Library on the western edge of the campus. Operated by the National Archives and Records Administration, it is one of twelve American presidential libraries. Former President George Bush remains actively involved with the university, frequently visiting the campus and participating in special events. Texas A&M received national media attention on November 18, 1999, when Aggie Bonfire, a ninety-year-old student tradition, collapsed during construction. Fifty-eight current and former students were working on the stack, which stood  high and consisted of 5000&nbsp;logs, when it fell; twelve of them died and twenty-seven others were injured. The accident was later attributed to improper design and poor construction practices, leading to "excessive internal stresses" on the logs and "inadequate containment strength", where the wiring used to tie the logs together was not strong enough. The wiring snapped after logs from upper tiers were "wedged" into lower tiers.  The victims' family members filed six lawsuits against Texas A&M officials, the student Bonfire leaders, and the university. In 2005, 36 of the 64 original defendants, including the student leaders, settled their portion of the case. A federal appeals court dismissed the remaining lawsuits against the university in 2007. Texas A&M dedicated the Bonfire Memorial on November 18, 2004 to honor the victims of the accident. With strong support from Rice University and the University of Texas at Austin, the Association of American Universities inducted Texas A&M in May 2001, based on the depth of the university's research and academic programs. In 2004, the honors organization Phi Beta Kappa opened its 265th chapter at Texas A&M.   In 2006, University President Robert Gates resigned from his position to become the U.S. Secretary of Defense. Texas A&M, one of the top 10 largest American universities, has an enrollment of 46,540 students pursuing degrees in 10 academic colleges. The student body represents all 50 U.S. states and 128 foreign countries. Texas residents account for 86.31% of the student population while 27.2% are either of international origin or members of ethnic minority groups. The student body consists of 46.9% women and 53.1% men. The university consistently ranks among the top ten public universities each year in enrollment of National Merit scholars. According to the College Board, the fall 2006 entering freshman class consisted of 46% students in the top 10% of their high school graduating class, 77% in the top quarter, and 90% in the top half. The middle 50% of the freshmen had an average SAT score between 1580 and 1900 (out of 2400) and an ACT score between 23 and 28. The Dwight Look College of Engineering has the largest enrollment of 20.5%. The College of Liberal Arts and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences follow, enrolling 15% and 14% of the student body, respectively. The College of Education and Human Development enrolls 12%, and Mays Business School enrolls about 11%. Colleges with less than 10% enrollment include the College of Architecture, the College of Science, the George Bush School of Government and Public Service, the College of Geosciences, and the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences. Approximately 8% of the student body has not declared a major.  The 2008 U.S. News and World Report ranks Texas A&M 62nd, tied with Worcester Polytechnic Institute, among all American universities and 23rd among public universities. The Washington Monthly ranks the school 1st nationally with criteria based on research, community service, and social mobility. Newsweek International ranks Texas A&M as the 77th university globally based on "openness and diversity" as well as "distinction in research". Shanghai Jiao Tong University ranks the university 50th nationally and 88th internationally based on educational quality, faculty quality, and research output. The Times Higher Education Supplement ranks Texas A&M 60th among the world's top 100 technology universities, 24th among America's top biomedicine universities, and 50th among North America's top 50 universities. The 2008 Kiplinger's Personal Finance ranks the school as the 25th best value public university based on in-state tuition, and the 9th best value public university based on out-of-state tuition. In addition, Hispanic Magazine ranks Texas A&M as 23rd nationally for Latinos, while New Mobility magazine ranks the university as one of the top ten "disability-friendly" colleges. The John Templeton Foundation listed Texas A&M as one of the thirty-five American college programs that "communicate[s] the values of honesty, trust, respect, responsibility, integrity, and fairness in the classroom". The Texas A&M University System (TAMUS) receives revenue from two primary endowments which complement revenues received from both research and tuition. TAMUS holds a minority stake in the Permanent University Fund (PUF), a Texas public endowment fund contributing to eighteen institutions and six agencies in the University of Texas and Texas A&M University systems. As of 2006, the PUF ending net asset value stood at $10.3&nbsp;billion, with $400.7&nbsp;million, in FY 2007 transferred to the Available University Fund for distribution to both university systems.  The Texas A&M System receives a third of the accumulated interest from the PUF, while the University of Texas System receives the other two-thirds, due to a 1931 Texas Legislature decision. Texas A&M also benefits from a private endowment, the Texas A&M Foundation, which totals over $1.17&nbsp;billion in assets. Combined, the total endowment for the TAMUS stands at $5.6&nbsp;billion, as of 2006. Texas A&M works with both state and university agencies on various local and international research projects to forge innovations in science and technology. Two primary institutional bodies carry out this research, most notably, Research Valley, an alliance of both educational and business organizations with the goal to foster collaborative research endeavors with commercial prospects. When combined, Research Valley consists of  with  of dedicated research space. A second institution involves Texas A&M's dedicated Research Park, established in 1982, consisting of , 10 buildings, dozens of corporations, and  of space. Research funding during the 2004 year totaled over $520.9 million, ranking Texas A&M among the top 20 American research institutes, a more than $100 million increase in a single decade. The school ranks 13th among all U.S. research universities in exchange agreements with institutions abroad. Texas A&M has made notable contributions to the animal cloning field of research. Spearheaded by the College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M scientists created the first cloned domestic animal, a cat named 'cc', on December 22, 2001, with funding from John Sperling. Texas A&M was also the first academic institution to clone each of six different species: cattle, a Boer goat, pigs, a cat, a deer and a horse. In 2004, Texas A&M and its research agencies received nearly $400 million in new awards, an increase of over $125 million over a 10-year period. The Texas A&M System faculty and research submitted 121 new inventions and established 78 new royalty-bearing licensing agreements during the year, receiving $8 million in income from the innovations. The Texas A&M Technology Licensing Office filed for 88 patents for protection of intellectual property in 2004. Also in 2004, Texas A&M joined a consortium of universities to build the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile. With seven mirrors, each with a diameter of , the optical telescope will have the equivalent of a  primary mirror. With construction slated to be complete in 2016, it will be the largest optical telescope ever constructed and ten times more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope. With the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, Texas A&M's nuclear research reactor became the first to convert uranium reactor fuel from a highly enriched form to a low-enriched safer form. Completed on October 13, 2006, the process of depleting the uranium from 70% enrichment to 20% enrichment finalized an 18-month, joint project. This accomplishment fulfilled a portion of U.S. President George W. Bush’s Global Nuclear Threat Reduction Initiative.  Undergraduates have many research opportunities, including AggieSat, an organization funded and sponsored by the Aerospace Department to build modularized satellites with NASA and the Air Force Research Lab. Approximately 80 undergraduate students representing 17 majors are involved, with assistance from graduates students in both engineering and business run AggieSat. Current projects include competing against several universities in Nanosat-5, an Air Force competition for constructing autonomous satellites, and a joint project with NASA and the University of Texas to develop two Cube Satellites for autonomous rendezvous and docking. The Texas A&M University Libraries support the school's teaching, research, and outreach missions with internationally recognized research collections in such fields as: Engineering & Technology, Entomology, Military History, Nautical Archaeology, Naval Science, Oceanography & Hydrology, Range Livestock, Science, and Transportation. Other research entities include the Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine, the Texas Transportation Institute, the Cyclotron Institute, the Institute of Biosciences and Technology, and the Institute for Plant Genomics and Biotechnology. Texas A&M has participated in over 500 research projects in over 80 countries and leads the Southwestern United States in annual research expenditures. The university conducts research on every continent and has formal research and exchange agreements with 100 institutions in 40 countries. Texas A&M ranks 13th among U.S. research universities in exchange agreements with institutions abroad and student participation in study abroad programs, and has strong research collaborations with the National Natural Science Foundation of China and many leading universities in China. Texas A&M owns two international facilities, a multipurpose center in Mexico City, Mexico and the Santa Chiara Study Abroad Center in Castiglion Fiorentino, Italy. In 2003, over 1,200 Aggie students, primarily undergraduates, studied abroad. Additionally, the university includes two branch campuses: Texas A&M at Qatar located in Education City in Doha, Qatar devoted to engineering disciplines and Texas A&M University at Galveston in Galveston, Texas, devoted to marine research and host to the Texas Maritime Academy. Texas A&M's Center for International Business Studies is one of 28 supported by the U.S. Department of Education. The university is also one of only two American universities in partnership with CONACyT, Mexico's equivalent of the National Science Foundation, to support research in areas including biotechnology, telecommunications, energy, and urban development. In addition, the university is the home of "Las Americas Digital Research Network", an online architecture network for 26 universities in 12 nations, primarily in Central and South America.  (See Mid-InfraRed Technologies for Health and the Environment [MIRTHE].)   Texas A&M's College Station campus, one of the largest in America, spans  plus  for Research Park.  The university is part of the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area located within Brazos County in the Brazos Valley (Southeast Central Texas) region, an area often referred to as "Aggieland".  The total population of College Station and Bryan totals 137,215, as of 2000. Money Magazine, in 2006, named College Station the most educated city in Texas, and the 11th most educated American city, due largely to the size of the university. Aggieland is centrally located within  of three of the 10 largest cities in the United States and 75% of the Texas and Louisiana populations (approximately 13.1 million people). The area's major roadway is State Highway 6, and several smaller state highways and Farm to Market Roads connect the area to larger highways such as Interstate 45. The campus is bisected by a railroad track operated by Union Pacific.  The area east of the tracks, known as Main Campus, includes buildings for the colleges of engineering, architecture, geosciences, science, education and liberal arts.  Dormitories, as well as the main dining centers and many campus support facilities, are also on Main Campus. Notable buildings on Main Campus include Kyle Field, the Academic Building, the Memorial Student Center, the Administration Building, Rudder Tower, Albritton Bell Tower, and the Bonfire Memorial.   To the west of the railroad tracks lies West Campus, which includes most of the sports facilities, the business school, agricultural programs, the veterinary college, the George Bush Presidential Library and two schools within the Texas A&M Health Science Center. Research Park, the area of West Campus along Kimbrough Boulevard, includes many research facilities. During the 2006 fall semester, 20.5% of the student body lived on campus in one of two distinct housing sections located on opposite ends of campus.  Both the Northside and Southside areas contain student dormitories, or residence halls. While some halls are single-sex, others are co-educational. Usually students of different genders live on alternate floors, although the Corps dormitories and Hobby Hall are segregated by room or suite. Residence hall styles vary; while many halls offer only indoor access to individual rooms, access to the rooms of "balcony halls", comes from an outdoor balcony. Room sizes vary by building, and halls with larger rooms including en-suite or private bathrooms, while halls with smaller rooms have a common bathroom on each floor. Several halls include a "substance-free" floor, where residents pledge to avoid bringing alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes into the hall. While the university provides a variety of dining facilities, non-Corps students are not required to purchase a meal plan.  Northside consists of 17 student residence halls, including the two university honors dorms. The halls are located near Northgate, a local entertainment district featuring the popular bar, the Dixie Chicken. The campus dining establishments Sbisa Dining Hall and The Underground are located on Northside. Some halls have unofficially claimed tables within the Sbisa Dining Hall and many halls congregate for dinner at a specific time each weekday.  Southside contains halls both for the Corps of Cadets members and "non-regs". Non-corps halls in this area center around the Commons, a hub for activities and dining. Southside has two Learning Living Communities, which allow freshmen to live in a cluster with other students who share common interests. Facilities for the Corps of Cadets are located in the Quadrangle, or "The Quad", an area consisting of dormitories, Duncan Dining Hall, and the Corps training fields. The Corps Arches, a series of 12 arches that "[symbolize] the undying spirit of the 12th Man of Texas A&M", mark the entrance to the Quadrangle. All cadets, except those who are married or who have had previous military service, must live in the Quad with assigned roommates from the same unit and graduating class. Reveille, the Aggie mascot, lives with her handlers in the Quadrangle. The Corps of Cadets (or the Corps) is the United States' largest uniformed student body outside the service academies. Members of the Corps have served in every armed conflict fought by the United States since 1876, and over 225 have served as Generals or Flag Officers. Many members participate in ROTC programs and earn commissions in the United States Armed Forces upon graduation.  Until 1965, Corps membership was mandatory at this Senior Military College. The Corps welcomed female members in the fall of 1974 and as of fall 2007, the co-ed Corps boasts an enrollment of 1,887&nbsp;cadets, representing all military branches. Composed of two Air Force Wings, three Army Brigades, and two Navy and Marine Regiments, as well as the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, whose members may be affiliated with any military branch, cadets are called "Keepers of the Spirit". Parson's Mounted Cavalry is the only mounted ROTC unit in the United States. The Ross Volunteer Company, the oldest student-run organization in the state, is the official honor guard for the Governor of Texas. The Fish Drill Team, a precision, close-order rifle drill team composed entirely of Corps freshmen, represents the Corps and A&M in local and national competitions. They have won the national championship almost every year since their creation in 1946, and have appeared in several Hollywood productions with prominent roles in the movies A Few Good Men and Courage Under Fire.  The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, the world's largest precision military marching band, provides music for University and Corps functions and presents intricate halftime performances at football games. Some band drills are so complicated that they require band members to step between each other's feet to complete the maneuvers. These drills must be drawn by hand since their computer program returns an error because it requires two people to be in the same spot at the same time. Texas A&M has over 800 student organizations, including academic, service, religious, Greek, and common interest organizations. Orientation programs encourage students to become involved in campus activities and organizations from the beginning. An April 2005 campus survey found that 74% of the students were currently involved with at least one organization and that 88% participated in a campus organization in the past. One of the oldest student organizations is the Singing Cadets, founded in 1893. Known as the "Voice of Aggieland", the Singing Cadets are an all-male choral group with 70 members. Despite their name, Corps membership is not required to join the Singing Cadets. The group travels nationally and has completed several international tours; most recently, South America in 2007. Established in the 1980s, the Texas A&M Wind Symphony is a 70-member wind ensemble that has performed in Ireland, England, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Carnegie Hall.[ ] [ ]  Students exercise at the Student Rec Center, a three-story facility encompassing , which includes exercise equipment, athletic courts, an indoor running track, a rock-climbing tower, and one of the top competitive pools and diving wells in America. The Rec Center also organizes intramural sports throughout the year. Some national service organizations originated at A&M. Aggie students founded the largest one-day student-run service project in America known as The Big Event. The annual service project allows students to give back to their community by assisting local residents. The organization CARPOOL, a student run, safe ride program has provided over 100,000&nbsp;free&nbsp;rides, as of January 2007, to Aggies unable to transport themselves home. Its organizers also assist other universities in establishing similar programs. In addition, the Corporation for National and Community Service listed A&M among the 500 academic institutions in the 2005-06 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. The Student Government Association (SGA), one of A&M's largest organizations,  consists of 1,200 student members in 3 branches, 14 committees, and 4 commissions. SGA has changed little since 1972, except its relative position within the official framework of the university. The Princeton Review ranked The Battalion, founded in 1893, as the 20th best college newspaper in America in 2008. Students also publish a secondary school newspaper, the Maroon Weekly.  Aggieland, formerly known as The Olio and The Longhorn, is one of America's largest college yearbooks in number of pages and copies sold. The university houses the public broadcasting stations: KAMU-TV, a PBS member station since 1970, KAMU-FM an NPR affiliate since 1977, and the student-run KANM, "the college station of College Station". W5AC broadcasted the first live, play-by-play broadcast of a college football game, at Kyle Field, in November 1921. The game, played in Dallas between Aggies and University of Texas, ended in a scoreless tie.  Aggies have developed many traditions, some as old as the school. Changes such as admission of females, non-compulsory participation in the Corps, and growth in the university's population have led to the evolution of many traditions. Though most public events are university-sponsored and sanctioned, others are strictly student-run, non-sanctioned events. The Aggie Ring promotes school spirit and camaraderie. Class rings have the same design except that of the class year. Students cannot order a ring until completing 95 credit hours of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&M, or until graduation. Graduate students may receive a ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed or after the acceptance of their dissertation or thesis. Though unsanctioned by the University, many students "dunk" their newly-acquired Aggie Rings into a pitcher of beer and quickly chug the entire pitcher to "earn" the ring. Some students dunk their rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages.  Texas A&M's official greeting is the word "howdy". Aggies consider it polite to greet as many people as comfortably possible with a smile and a "howdy". "Howdy" is the preferred method for a speaker to get a large group's attention, as the members of the group are expected to return the "howdy" back to the speaker.  Beginning in 1909, Aggie students built a bonfire each year on the grounds of the school. Though it began as a trash pile, Aggie Bonfire evolved into a massive six-tiered structure, the world record being held at . It burned before the annual football game versus the University of Texas. After the collapse of 1999, the university suspended Bonfire indefinitely, but some Aggies continue the tradition off-campus.   Muster officially began on April 21, 1922, as a day for remembrance of fellow Aggies.  The March 1923 Texas Aggie urged, "If there is an A&M man in one-hundred miles of you, you are expected to get together, eat a little, and live over the days you spent at the A&M College of Texas."  Modern muster ceremonies occur at around 320 locations globally including Kabul, Afghanistan, and Baghdad, Iraq.   The largest ceremony occurs on the A&M campus in Reed Arena.  The "Roll Call for the Absent" commemorates Aggies who died since the last roll call. As names are called, a family member or friend answers, "Here", and a candle is lit. Campus muster also serves as a 50th year class reunion. Some muster gatherings do not have the campus ceremony pageantry, and may simply be a barbecue. Silver Taps began in 1898 to honor Lawrence Sullivan Ross, then the president of the school. It evolved into a monthly tradition to honor current Aggie students who pass away that month. Flags fly half-staff the day of Silver Taps and notices are posted throughout campus. At 10:15 P.M. the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza. Following a 21-gun salute by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad, six buglers play an A&M version of the song Taps, Silver Taps, three times from the dome of the school's Academic Building: once to the north, the south and to the west. The song is not played to the east symboling that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again. In Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic (the forerunner of the Cotton Bowl) A&M played defending national champion Centre College in the first post-season game in the southwest. A&M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that Coach D. X. Bible feared he wouldn’t have enough men to finish the game. He called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill volunteered and donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir. Although he did not actually play, his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. A&M won 22-14, but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. The 12th Man has evolved into an Aggie tradition. The student body, known as the "12th Man", stands throughout the entire game, "ready to help the team". Another part of the 12th man tradition is when the head coach before each game chooses a walk-on player to represent the student body. This player wears the No. 12 jersey, participates in kick-off returns, and is called "The 12th Man".  The 12th Man uses a variety of school yells, rather than cheers, to support Aggie teams. Each year the student body elects five students to serve as the Yell Leaders. At midnight before each home football game at Kyle Field or at a predesignated location at away games, the fans gather together to practice the yells for the next day's game. Led by the Yell Leaders, and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, the Twelfth Man files into the stadium to practice yells, sing the War Hymn, and joke about their opponents. One tradition at the games is when the Aggies score, Aggies kiss their dates. Close to the end of midnight yell, the lights turn off and Aggies practice this tradition. A charter member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution in 1996, A&M now competes in the Big 12 Conference (South Division). The school's 20 sports teams are known as the Aggies, and the school's colors are maroon and white. As of 2006, Aggies have earned 92 Southwest and Big 12 conference regular-season and tournament titles and 12 national championships. The women's soccer team, formed in 1993, earned 12 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1995-2006, advancing at least as far as the round of 16 in seven of the last eight appearances. The women's volleyball team earned 12 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1993-2004, advancing past the first round each time. For the 2006-2007 school year, seven Aggie sports teams won Big 12 Championships: women's soccer (regular season), women's basketball (regular season), women's indoor track and field, women's outdoor track and field, women's golf, and women's swimming and diving. In 2004 Sports Illustrated on Campus ranked Olsen Field "the best college baseball venue".   Due to the quality of A&M's sports programs ,Sports Illustrated ranked the university 46th, in a 2002 analysis of "America's Best Sports College[s]"  and College Station the 9th best college sports town. A&M's archrival is the University of Texas. In 2004, sporting events between the Aggies and Longhorns became known as the Lone Star Showdown. The most-watched event in the rivalry is the annual football game held the day after Thanksgiving. The Texas Tech Red Raiders also consider A&M a rival.   Founded in 1894, the football team has won 18 Southwest Conference championships, a Big 12 championship, two Big 12 South Division championships, and one national championship. The team has appeared in a total of 30 bowl games, winning 13, and has produced 41 first Team All-Americans, five Academic All-Americans, and one Heisman Trophy winner. Twenty-one Aggies currently play in the NFL, and nine others serve as NFL coaches. Since 1904, home football games have been played at Kyle Field, a stadium with a current capacity of 82,600. In 2004, CBS SportsLine.com ranked Kyle Field the top football stadium while Sporting News ranked it fourth. The same year Sports Illustrated on Campus ranked an A&M football weekend the third best college football experience.   Founded in 1912, the men's basketball team won 11 Southwest Conference championships and two Southwest Conference Tournament championships. The team has appeared in the National Invitation Tournament six times and in the NCAA Tournament eight times. Three of those eight NCAA tournament appearances include Sweet Sixteen appearances, the highest the Aggies have advanced. The women's basketball team has had 3 NCAA Tournament appearances, reaching as high as the Sweet Sixteen. They have also competed in the NWIT/WNIT twice, winning that tournament in 1994-1995. The men's basketball team is coached by first-year head coach Mark Turgeon. The women's team has been coached by Gary Blair since 2003.
