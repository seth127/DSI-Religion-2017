   The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIThe aircraft was originally designated the AH, and later redesignated F4H.  The F-4 designation came in 1961 when the designation systems for all branches of the military were unified by the order of Robert McNamara.  Within McDonnell, the F-4 was referred to as Model 98. is an American two-seat, twin-engined supersonic long-range all-weather fighter-bomber originally developed for the U.S. Navy by McDonnell Aircraft.Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 301. The Phantom remained in production from 1958 to 1981, with a total of 5,195 built, and was used by the U.S. military from 1960 to 1996, serving with the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and the US Navy.Integrated Defense Systems: F-4 Phantoms Phabulous 40th. Boeing. Retrieved: 19 January 2008.  It was used extensively by all three U.S. services operating in Vietnam, ending the war as the principal air superiority fighter for both the Navy and Air Force, as well as being important in the ground-attack and reconnaissance roles. The Phantom continued to form a major part of U.S. military air power throughout the 1970s and 80s, being gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon in the U.S. Air Force and the F-14 Tomcat and F/A-18 Hornet in the U.S. Navy.  It remained in service in the reconnaissance and Wild Weasel roles in the 1991 Gulf War. The Phantom was also operated by the armed forces of 11 other nations.  Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat in numerous Arab–Israeli conflicts, while Iran used its large fleet of Phantoms in the Iran–Iraq War.  Phantoms remain in front line service with seven countries, and in use as an unmanned target in the U.S. Air Force. The F-4 Phantom was designed as a fleet defense fighter for the U.S. Navy, and first entered service in 1960.  By 1963, it had been adopted by the U.S. Air Force for the fighter-bomber role.  When production ended in 1981, 5,195 Phantom IIs had been built, making it the most numerous American supersonic military aircraft.F-4 Phantoms Phabulous 40th: First to Last.

National Museum of the USAF. Retrieved: 20 January 2008 Since the F-8 Crusader was to be used for close combat, the F-4 was designed, like other interceptors of the day, without an internal cannon;Angelucci, 1987. p. 310. In a dogfight, the RIO or WSO (commonly called "backseater" or "pitter") assisted in spotting opposing fighters, visually as well as on radar. It became the primary fighter-bomber of both the Navy and Air Force by the end of the Vietnam War. Due to its distinctive appearance and widespread service with United States military and its allies, the F-4 is one of the best-known icons of the Cold War. It served in the Vietnam War and Arab–Israeli conflicts, with American F-4 crews achieving 277 aerial victories in South East Asia and completing countless ground attack sorties.Angelucci, 1987. p. 312.  The F-4 Phantom has the distinction of being the last United States fighter to attain ace status in the 20th century. During the Vietnam War, the USAF had one pilot and two WSOs, and the USN one pilot and one RIO, become aces in air-to-air combat. It was also a capable tactical reconnaissance and Wild Weasel (suppression of enemy air defenses) platform, seeing action as late as 1991, during Operation Desert Storm.Donald Spring 1991, p. 26.Donald Summer 1991, p. 22. The F-4 Phantom II was also the only aircraft used by both of the USA's flight demonstration teams. The USAF Thunderbirds (F-4E) and the USN Blue Angels (F-4J) both switched to the Phantom for the 1969 season; the Thunderbirds flew it for five seasons,Lake 1992, p. 190. the Blue Angels for six.Lake 1992, p. 203. The baseline performance of a Mach&nbsp;2-class fighter with long range and a bomber-sized payload would be the template for the next generation of large and light/middle-weight fighters optimized for daylight air combat. The Phantom would be replaced by the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon in the U.S. Air Force. In the U.S. Navy, it would be replaced by the F-14 Tomcat and the F/A-18 Hornet which revived the concept of a dual-role attack fighter.Donald, David. Warplanes of the Fleet. London: AIRtime Publishing Inc., 2004. ISBN 1-880588-81-1. The origins of McDonnell’s F-4 can be traced to a 1953 request by the Navy for an upgrade of the McDonnell F3H Demon carrier-borne fighter. Although the Vought F8U Crusader won the contract, the "Super Demon" (as McDonnell’s entrant was dubbed) was developed as a ground attack aircraft under the designation AH, which by 1955 had evolved into an all-weather air superiority fighter designated F4H. The F4H first flew in 1958 and remained in production from 1959 until 1981. Dave Lewis was the chief of preliminary design and, ultimately, the program manager for development and the sales effort.Thornborough and Davies, 1994. p.13. In 1952, McDonnell’s Chief of Aerodynamics, Dave Lewis, was appointed by CEO Jim McDonnell to be the company’s Preliminary Design Manager. With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type, an attack fighter. At the time, the Navy had separate fighter and attack branches, each with separate systems and operational requirements. After many iterations and various "enemy capability" assumptions, an unsolicited attack fighter was presented to the Navy. The McDonnell design called for two engines. The primary air-to-air armament was provided by the new Sparrow III air-to-air missiles, semi-recessed in the fuselage. The air-to-ground armament was to be as many bombs as could be carried on stations under the wings and aft of the Sparrows on the fuselage. No guns were offered. It took two years of hard work with the Bureau of Aeronautics and the Naval Air Warfare Division in the Pentagon, but the F-4 was sold with a configuration similar to what was originally proposed.Thornborough and Davies  1994, p. 11. In 1953, McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its F3H Demon naval fighter, seeking expanded capabilities and better performance. The company developed several projects including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine, Dorr 2008, p. 61. and variants powered by two Wright J65 engines, or two General Electric J79 engines.F-4 Phantoms Phabulous 40th -  Phantom Development 1978 Commemorative Book. Boeing Integrated Defence Systems. Retrieved 14 February 2008 The J79-powered version promised a top speed of Mach&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the United States Navy with a proposal for the "Super Demon". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular&mdash;it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;millimeter cannon, or 56 FFAR unguided rockets in addition to the nine hardpoints under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H but felt that the upcoming Grumman XF9F-9 and Vought XF8U-1 already satisfied the need for the supersonic fighter.Lake 1992, p. 15. The McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar. The XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45&nbsp;degrees and was equipped with a boundary layer control system for better low-speed handling. Wind tunnel testing had revealed lateral instability requiring the addition of five&nbsp;degrees dihedral to the wings.Donald and Lake 2002  To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12&nbsp;degrees which averaged to the required five&nbsp;degrees over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive "dogtooth" for improved control at high angles of attack. The all-moving tailplane was given 23&nbsp;degrees of anhedral to improve control at high angles of attack while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.  In addition, air intakes were equipped with movable ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the AN/APQ-50 radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of 23&nbsp;ft per second (7&nbsp;m/s), while the nose strut could extend by some 20&nbsp;inches (50&nbsp;cm) to increase angle of attack at takeoff. There were proposals to name the F4H "Satan" and "Mithras", the Persian god of light. Kunsan Airbase F-4 Phantom II  In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name "Phantom II," the first "Phantom" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the FH-1. The Phantom II briefly carried the designation F-110A and was also given the name of "Spectre" by the USAF, neither title was used.Angelucci, 1987. p. 316. On 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production fighters. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 bleed air holes on each ramp; and the aircraft soon squared off against the XF8U-3. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines, each having 16,100 pound-force (71.8 kN) of afterburning thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete launch-recovery cycle performed on 15 February 1960 from USS Independence. Early in production, the radar was upgraded to a larger AN/APQ-72, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less claustrophobic.Lake 1992, p. 21. The Phantom underwent a great many changes during its career, summarized in the "Variants" section below. The United States Air Force received Phantoms as the result of Robert McNamara’s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the military. After an F-4B won the "Operation Highspeed" fly-off against the F-106 Delta Dart, the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A "Spectre" in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the Navy focus on interception, the USAF emphasized a fighter-bomber role. With McNamara’s unification of designations on 18 September 1962, the Phantom became the F-4 with the Naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C. The first Air Force Phantom flew on 27 May 1963, exceeding Mach&nbsp;2 on its maiden flight.Knaack 1978, p. 266. Phantom II production ended in the United States in 1979 after 5,195 had been built (5,057 by McDonnell Douglas and 138 in Japan by Mitsubishi), making it the second most produced and exported American military-jet; the F-86 Sabre still remains the most numerous jet-powered warplane produced and exported by the United States. Of these, 2,874 went to the USAF, 1,264 to the Navy and Marine Corps, and the rest to foreign customers. Integrated Defense Systems: F-4 Phantoms Phabulous 40th. Boeing. Retrieved: 22 May 2007.  The last U.S.-built F-4 went to Turkey, while the last F-4 ever built was completed in 1981 as an F-4EJ by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan. As of 2001, about 1,100 Phantoms remained in service worldwide, including QF-4 drones operated by the U.S. military.Green and Swanborough 2001 To show off their new fighter, the Navy led a series of record-breaking flights early in Phantom development: All in all, the Phantom set 16 world records. With the exception of Skyburner, all records were achieved in unmodified production aircraft. Five of the speed records remained unbeaten until the F-15 Eagle appeared in 1975. In air combat, the Phantom's greatest advantage was its thrust, which permitted a skilled pilot to engage and disengage from the fight at will.Goebel, Greg. Phantom Over Southeast Asia. Vectorsite.net. Retrieved: 18 January 2008. The massive aircraft, designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly on the edge of its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high-angle-of-attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed. The J79 engines produced copious amounts of black smoke at military power which made the Phantoms easy to spot from a distance, a severe disadvantage in air combat against smaller aircraft. Pilots could eliminate the smoke by using afterburner, but at the cost of fuel efficiency.McDonnell Douglas F-4S Phantom. MAPS Air Museum at Akron-Canton Airport. Retrieved: 19 November 2007. Some pilots adopted the procedure of running one engine in dry thrust at normal power setting, and the other in afterburner, resulting in the same total thrust as using both engines at full rated military power without generating the tell-tale smoke trail. The F-4's biggest weakness, as it was initially designed, was its lack of an internal cannon. For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots air combat maneuvering. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to use multiple shots just to hit one target. To compound the problem, rules of engagement in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although in 1967 USAF F-4Cs began carrying SUU-16 or SUU-23 external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;millimeter M61 Vulcan Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights, virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to drag, combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate, yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20&nbsp;millimeter M61 Vulcan on the F-4E.Higham and Williams 1978 Note: Costs are in 1965 United States dollars and have not been adjusted for inflation.Knaack 1978 On 30 December 1960, the VF-121 Pacemakers became the first Phantom operator with its F4H-1Fs (F-4As). The VF-74 Be-devilers at NAS Oceana became the first deployable Phantom squadron when it received its F4H-1s (F-4Bs) on 8 July 1961.Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 260. The squadron completed carrier qualifications in October 1961 and Phantom’s first full carrier deployment between August 1962 and March 1963 aboard USS Forrestal.Lake 1992, p. 199.  The second deployable US Atlantic Fleet squadron to receive F-4Bs was the VF-102 Diamondbacks who promptly took their new aircraft on the shakedown cruise of Enterprise.Lake 1992, p. 200. The first deployable US Pacific Fleet squadron to receive the F-4B was the VF-114 Aardvarks, which participated in the September 1962 cruise aboard Kitty Hawk.Thornborough and Davies, 1994, p. 260. By the time of the Tonkin Gulf incident, 13 of 31 deployable Navy squadrons were armed with the type. F-4Bs from Constellation made the first Phantom combat sortie of the Vietnam War on 5 August 1964, flying bomber escort in Operation Pierce Arrow. Dorr 1995, p. 196. The first Phantom air-to-air victory of the war took place on 9 April 1965 when an F-4B from VF-96 Fighting Falcons piloted by Lt JG Terence M. Murphy shot down a Chinese MiG-17 'Fresco'. The Phantom was then shot down, apparently by an AIM-7 Sparrow from one of its wingmen. On 17 June 1965, an F-4B from VF-21 Freelancers piloted by Cdr Thomas C. Page and Lt John C. Smith shot down the first North Vietnamese MiG of the war. Dorr and Bishop 1996, p. 44. On 10 May 1972, Randy "Duke" Cunningham and William P. Driscoll flying an F-4J with the radio call sign "Showtime 100" shot down three MiG-17s to become the first flying aces of the war. Their fifth victory was believed at the time to be over a mysterious North Vietnamese ace Colonel Toon, now considered mythical. On the return flight, the Phantom was damaged by an enemy surface-to-air missile. To avoid being captured, Cunningham and Driscoll flew their burning aircraft upside down (the damage made the aircraft uncontrollable in a conventional attitude) until they could eject over water. Cunningham and Driscoll became USN aces by shooting down five or more enemy aircraft. Dorr and Bishop 1996, p. 188–189. During the war, Navy Phantom squadrons participated in 84 combat tours with F-4Bs, F-4Js, and F-4Ns. The Navy claimed 40 air-to-air victories at the cost of 71 Phantoms lost in combat (5 to aircraft, 13 to SAMs, and 53 to AAA). An additional 54 Phantoms were lost in accidents. Of the 40 aircraft shot down by Navy and Marine Phantom crews, 22 were MiG-17s, 14 MiG-21s, two Antonov An-2s, and two MiG-19s. Of these, eight aircraft were downed by AIM-7 Sparrow missiles and 31 by AIM-9 Sidewinders.Grossnick 1997. By 1983, the F-4Ns had been completely replaced by F-14 Tomcats, and by 1986 the last F-4Ss were exchanged for F/A-18 Hornets. On 25 March 1986, an F-4S belonging to VF 151 Vigilantes became the last Navy Phantom to launch from an aircraft carrier (Midway). On 18 October 1986, an F-4S from VF-202 Superheats made the last-ever Phantom carrier landing aboard America. In 1987, the last of the Naval Reserve-operated F-4Ss were replaced by F-14s. The last Phantoms in service with the Navy were the QF-4 target drones operated by the Naval Air Warfare Centers.  These were retired in 2004. Hunter, Jamie and Collens, Richard.

The Marines received their first F-4Bs in June 1962, with the VMFA-314 Black Knights becoming the first operational squadron. In addition to attack variants, the Marines also operated several tactical reconnaissance RF-4Bs. Marine Phantoms from VMFA-531 Gray Ghost arrived in Vietnam on 10 April 1965, flying close air support missions from land bases as well as from America. Marine F-4 pilots claimed three enemy MiGs (two while on exchange duty with the USAF) at the cost of 75 aircraft lost in combat, mostly to ground fire, and four in accidents.

Unlike the Navy, the Air Force initially flew its Phantoms with a rated pilot in the back seat rather than a weapon/targeting systems officer (later designated as weapon systems officer or WSO), and all USAF Phantoms retained dual flight controls. USAF F-4Cs scored their first victories against North Vietnamese MiG-17s on 10 July 1965 using AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.Dorr and Bishop 1996, p. 48–49. On 24 July 1965, a Phantom from the 47th Tactical Fighter Squadron on temporary assignment in Vietnam became the first American aircraft to be downed by an enemy SAM, and on 5 October 1966 an 8th Tactical Fighter Wing F-4C became the first U.S. jet lost to an air-to-air missile, fired by a MiG-21. Early aircraft suffered from leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft were found to have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. Although the F-4C was essentially identical to the Navy F-4B in flight performance and carried the Navy-designed Sidewinder missiles, USAF-tailored F-4Ds initially arrived in June 1967 equipped with AIM-4 Falcons. However, the Falcon like its predecessors was designed to shoot down bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others, and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the "Rivet Haste" program in early 1968, and by 1972, the AIM-7E-2 "Dogfight Sparrow" had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots. Like other Vietnam War Phantoms, the F-4Ds were urgently fitted with radar homing and warning (RHAW) antennae to detect the Soviet-built SA-2 Guideline SAMs.Knaack 1974, p. 274. From the initial deployment of the F-4C to Southeast Asia, USAF Phantoms performed both air superiority and ground attack roles, supporting not only ground troops in South Vietnam but also conducting bombing sorties in Laos and North Vietnam. As the F-105 force underwent severe attrition between 1965 and 1968, the bombing role of the F-4 proportionately increased until after November 1970 (when the last F-105D was withdrawn from combat) it became the primary USAF ordnance delivery system. In October 1972 the first squadron of EF-4C Wild Weasel aircraft deployed to Thailand on temporary duty.Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 188.

Then, on 15 August 1990, 24 F-4G Wild Weasel Vs and six RF-4Cs were mobilized to the Middle East for Operation Desert Storm. The reason for this was that the F-4G was the only aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) role since the EF-111 Raven lacked the offensive capability of AGM-88 HARM missiles. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera.

They were so well-liked that the RAAF considered adopting the F-4E instead.Lake 1992, p. 209. In 1979, the Egyptian Air Force purchased 35 former USAF F-4Es along with a number of Sparrow, Sidewinder, and Maverick missiles from the US for $594 million as part of the "Peace Pharaoh" program. Fricker 2000, p. 59. An additional seven surplus USAF aircraft were purchased in 1988. Fricker 2000, p. 60. Three attrition replacements had been received by the end of the 1990s. The German Luftwaffe initially ordered the reconnaissance RF-4E in 1969, receiving a total of 88 aircraft which were delivered from January 1971.Lake 1992, p. 210. In 1982, the initially unarmed RF-4Es were given a secondary ground attack capability, and were retired in 1994. Fricker 2000, p. 80. In 1973, under the "Peace Rhine" program the Luftwaffe purchased the lightened and simplified F-4F which was upgraded in the mid-1980s. Germany also initiated the "ICE" (Improved Combat Efficiency) program in 1983. The 110 ICE-upgraded F-4Fs entered service in 1992, and are expected to remain in service until 2012. List 2006, p. 51. Twenty-four German-owned F-4Fs were operated by the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing of the USAF at Holloman AFB to train Luftwaffe crews until 2002. In 1975, Germany also received 10 F-4Es for training in the U.S. In the late 1990s, these were withdrawn from service, being replaced by F-4Fs. Fricker 2000, p. 81. In 1971, the Hellenic Air Force purchased brand new F-4E and RF-4E Phantoms, with surplus RF-4Es and F-4Es from the German Luftwaffe and U.S. ANG being given to Greece in the early 1990s. Several of the aircraft were modified to the F-4G Wild Weasel V standard. Following the success of the German ICE program, on 11 August 1997, DASA of Germany received a contract to upgrade 39 aircraft to the very similar "Peace Icarus 2000" standard. In the 1960s and 1970s, then U.S.-friendly Iran purchased 225 F-4D, F-4E and RF-4E Phantoms. The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Phantoms saw action in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and are kept operational by overhaul and servicing from Iran’s aerospace industry. Fricker 2000, p. 64. The Israeli Air Force has been the largest foreign user of the Phantom, flying both newly built and ex-USAF aircraft, as well as several one-off special reconnaissance variants. The first F-4Es, nicknamed "Kurnass" (Heavy hammer), and RF-4Es, nicknamed "Orev" (Raven), were delivered in 1969 under the "Peace Echo I" program. Additional Phantoms arrived during the 1970s under "Peace Echo II" through "Peace Echo V" and "Nickel Grass" programs. Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat during Arab–Israeli conflicts, first seeing action during the War of Attrition. Nordeen 1991, p. 99. In the 1980s, Israel began the "Kurnass 2000" modernization program which significantly updated avionics. The last Israeli F-4s were retired in 2004.

From 1968, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force purchased  a total of 140 F-4EJ Phantoms without aerial refueling and ground attack capabilities. Fricker 2000, p. 85. Mitsubishi built 138 under license in Japan and 14 unarmed reconnaissance RF-4Es were imported. Of these, 96 F-4EJs have since been modified to the F-4EJ Kai (改、 "modified") standard. Seventeen F-4EJs have been converted to reconnaissance aircraft designated RF-4EJ, with similar upgrades as the F-4EJ Kai. As of 2007, Japan has a fleet of 90 F-4s in service and talks are underway to replace them with the Eurofighter Typhoon.Grevatt, Jon. "Japan narrows next-generation fighter requirement choice."

The ex-USAF F-4Ds continued to be delivered until 1988. The "Peace Pheasant II" program also provided newly-built and ex-USAF F-4Es.Lake 1992, p. 218. The Ejercito del Aire (Spanish Air Force)  acquired its first batch of ex-USAF F-4C Phantoms in 1971 under the "Peace Alfa" program. Designated C.12, the aircraft were retired in 1989. At the same time, the SAF received a number of ex-USAF RF-4Cs, designated RC.12. In 1995–1996, these aircraft received extensive avionics upgrades.

The Turkish Air Force received 40 F-4Es in 1974, with a further 32 F-4Es and 8 RF-4Es in 1977-78 under the "Peace Diamond III" program, followed by 40 ex-USAF aircraft in "Peace Diamond IV" in 1987, and a further 40 ex-U.S. Air National Guard Aircraft in 1991. Fricker 2000, p. 88. A further 32 RF-4Es were transferred to Turkey after being retired by the Luftwaffe between 1992 and 1994. In 1995, IAI of Israel implemented an upgrade similar to Kurnass 2000 on 54 Turkish F-4Es which were dubbed the F-4E 2020 Terminator. The United Kingdom bought versions based on the USN F-4J for use with the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. The main differences were the use of the British Rolls-Royce Spey engines and of British-made avionics. The FAA and RAF versions were given the designation F-4K and F-4M respectively, and entered service as the Phantom FG.1 (fighter/ground attack) and Phantom FGR.2 (fighter/ground attack/reconnaissance).Donald 1999, p. 11.Donald 1999, p. 5. After the Falklands War, 15 upgraded ex-USN F-4Js, known as the F-4J(UK) entered RAF service to compensate for one interceptor squadron redeployed to the islands. Around 15 RAF squadrons received various marks of Phantom, many of them based in Germany.  The first to be equipped was 6 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in July 1969. One noteworthy deployment was to 43 Squadron where Phantom FG1s remained the squadron equipment for a remarkable twenty years, arriving in September 1969 and departing in July 1989. During this period the squadron was based throughout at Leuchars.   = Jefford  The interceptor Phantoms were replaced by the Panavia Tornado F3 from the late 1980s onwards, and the last British Phantoms were retired in October 1992 when 74 Squadron disbanded.   = Jefford  Sandia National Laboratories used an F-4 mounted on a "rocket sled" in a crash test to see the results of an aircraft hitting a reinforced concrete structure, such as a nuclear power plant.Fact sheet (PDF).
