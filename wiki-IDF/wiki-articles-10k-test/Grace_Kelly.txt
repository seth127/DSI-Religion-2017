   Grace, Princess of Monaco née Grace Patricia Kelly (November 12 1929 &ndash; September 14 1982) was an Academy Award-winning American film and stage actress who, upon marriage to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco in 1956, became Her Serene Highness The Princess of Monaco, but was generally known as Princess Grace of Monaco. Princess Grace maintained dual American and Monegasque citizenship after her marriage. The principality's current Sovereign Prince, Albert II is the son of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace. The American Film Institute ranked Kelly #13 amongst the Greatest Female Stars of All Time. Grace Patricia Kelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she grew up in the East Falls section, the third of four children to John Brendan Kelly, Sr., also known as Jack Kelly, and Margaret Katherine Majer Kelly. Grace's siblings, in order of age, were Peggy, John Jr., and Lizanne.  Her father was one of ten children of John Henry Kelly (1847-1897) and Mary Costello in an Irish American Catholic family (originally from Kidney Lake, Newport, County Mayo, Ireland). Already a local hero as a triple Olympic-gold-medal-winning sculler when the sport of rowing was most popular, John Kelly's brick business grew to become the largest on the East Coast. The self-made millionaire and his family were introduced to Philadelphia society. Mr. Kelly's large family included two uncles prominent in the arts: Walter Kelly, a vaudevillian, and George Kelly, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright who, outside of Grace, was looked down upon by the family because of his homosexuality. In 1935, John Kelly ran for mayor of Philadelphia, losing by the closest margin for any Democrat in Philadelphia. He later served on the Fairmount Park Commission.  During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him National Director of Physical Fitness, a post that allowed Kelly to use his fame to promote physical fitness. Grace's mother, born to Lutheran German parents (Carl Maier and Margaretha Berg), converted to Catholicism upon marrying Mr. Kelly. Like her husband, Margaret Kelly was a proponent of health and fitness, studying Physical Education at Temple University, and later becoming the first woman to head the Physical Education Department at the University of Pennsylvania. John B. Kelly, Jr., Grace’s brother, followed in the family's athletic tradition: his rowing exploits were well chronicled. He won the James E. Sullivan Award in 1947 as the top amateur athlete in the country.  As a wedding gift, John, Jr., gave his sister his bronze medal from the 1956 Summer Olympics. Kelly Drive in Philadelphia is named for John, Jr., who was a city councilman there.  While attending the prestigious Ravenhill Academy, Grace modeled fashions at local social events with her mother and sisters. She gained her first acting experience at the age of twelve, when she played a lead role in Don't Feed the Animals, a play produced by the Old Academy Players in East Falls. During high school, she acted and danced, graduating from Stevens School, a small private school in a mansion on Walnut Lane in Germantown, Philadelphia, in May 1947. Her graduation yearbook listed her favorite actress as Ingrid Bergman; her favorite actor, Joseph Cotten; her favorite summer resort, Ocean City; her favorite drink, a black and white chocolate milkshake; her favorite piece of classical music, Debussy's "Clair de Lune"; her favorite orchestra, Benny Goodman; and her favorite female singer, Jo Stafford. Written in the "Stevens' Prophecy" section was, “Miss Grace P. Kelly - a famous star of stage and screen.” Upon her rejection by Bennington College in July 1947 because of her low mathematics scores (to the dismay of her mother), Grace decided to pursue her dreams of a career in the theater, using a scene from her uncle's 1923 play, The Torch-Bearers, for an audition into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Although the school had already selected its quota for the semester, Grace wangled an interview with Emile Diestel, the school's admission officer. Other notable alumni from this era include Katharine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall, Gene Tierney, and Spencer Tracy. Living in Manhattan's Barbizon Hotel for Women, a prestigious establishment which barred men from entering after 10 p.m., and working as a model to support her studies, Grace began her first term the following October. A diligent student, she would use a recorder to practice and perfect her speech. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, most notably a Broadway debut in Strindberg’s The Father alongside Raymond Massey. At 19, her graduation performance was in The Philadelphia Story, a role with which she would also end her film career, in the MGM musical film version High Society. Television producer Delbert Mann cast her as "Bethel Merriday", an adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel of the same name, in her first of nearly sixty live television programs. Success on television eventually brought her a role in a major motion picture. Kelly made her film debut in a small role in the 1951 film Fourteen Hours. The small role led to many offers, all of which she turned down for independence and another chance at the theater. She was performing in Colorado’s notable Elitch Gardens when she received a telegram from Hollywood producer Stanley Kramer, offering her the starring role opposite Gary Cooper in High Noon. According to biographer Wendy Leigh, at age 22 Kelly had an off-set romance with both Cooper and director Fred Zinnemann. High Noon would go to be a popular film of the 1950s. In September 1952, Grace was flown to Los Angeles by MGM to audition for the role of Linda Nordley in the studio's production of Mogambo. Gene Tierney was initially cast in the role, but dropped out at the last minute due to emotional problems. Kelly won the role, along with a 7-year contract, although she was hired at a relatively low salary of $850 a week. Kelly signed the deal under two conditions: First, one out of every two years, she have time off to work in the theater and second, that she be able to live in New York City. Just two months later, in November, the cast arrived in Nairobi to begin production. She later told famed Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, "Mogambo had three things that interested me. John Ford, Clark Gable, and a trip to Africa with expenses paid. If Mogambo had been made in Arizona, I wouldn't have done it." Critics praised Grace's patrician beauty, despite receiving third billing. The role garnered her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. After the heightened success of Mogambo, Grace starred in a TV play The Way of an Eagle, with Jean-Pierre Aumont before being cast in the film adaptation of Frederick Knott's Broadway hit Dial M for Murder. Alfred Hitchcock was slated to direct the film and would become one of Kelly's last mentors. Hitchcock also took full advantage of Kelly's virginal beauty on-camera. In a scene in which her character Margot Wendice is nearly murdered, a struggle that breaks out between her and her would-be-killer Tony Dawson clearly accentuates her curves and statuesque figure, which is closely hugged by a flimsy nightgown as she kicks her legs and flails her arms attempting to fight off her killer. Dial M for Murder opened in theaters in May 1954 to both positive reviews and box-office triumph. The role of Margot Wendice was a beginning for Grace as a poised and confident role-playing actress. Grace began filming scenes for her next film, The Bridges at Toko-Ri, in January 1954 with William Holden. The role of Nancy, the cordially wretched wife of naval officer Harry (played by Holden), proved to be a minor but pivotal part of the story. Released in January 1955, The New Yorker wrote of Kelly and Holden's unbridled onscreen chemistry, taking note of Grace's performance on part "with quiet confidence." In October 1954 Grace received a telegram that Alfred Hitchcock had scheduled her a wardrobe fitting with Edith Head, arguably Hollywood's most premier and elite costume designer, for the director's next film, Rear Window. In going forth with the role of Lisa Fremont, Grace unhesitatingly turned down the opportunity to star alongside Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront, which won her replacement, Eva Marie Saint, an Academy Award. "All through the making of Dial M for Murder, he [Hitchcock] sat and talked to me about Rear Window all the time, even before we had discussed my being in it."  Much like the shooting of Dial M for Murder, Grace and Hitchcock shared a close bond of humor and admiration. Sometimes, however, minor strifes would emerge on set concerning the wardrobe.  "At the rehearsal for the scene in Rear Window when I wore a sheer nightgown, Hitchcock called for Edith Head. He came over here and said, 'Look, the bosom is not right, we're going to have to put something in there.' He was very sweet about it; he didn't want to upset me, so he spoke quietly to Edith. When we went into my dressing room and Edith said, 'Mr. Hitchcock is worried because there's a false pleat here. He wants me to put in falsies.' Well, I said, 'You can't put falsies in this, it's going to show and I'm not going to wear them.' And she said, 'What are we going to do?' So we quickly took it up here, made some adjustments there, and I just did what I could and stood as straight as possible - without falsies. When I walked out onto the set Hitchcock looked at me and at Edith and said, 'See what a difference they make?'"  Grace's new co-star, James Stewart, was highly enthusiastic about working with Grace.  The role of Lisa Fremont, a wealthy Manhattan socialite and model, was unlike any of the previous women which she had played. For the very first time, she was an independent career woman. Stewart played a speculative photographer with a broken leg, bound to a wheelchair, who is curiously reduced to observing the happenings of tenants outside his window. Kelly is not seen until twenty-two minutes into the movie. Just as he had done earlier, Hitchcock provided the camera with a slow-sequenced silhouette of Kelly, along with a close-up of the two stars kissing and finally lingering closely on her profile. With the film's opening in October 1954, Kelly was yet again praised. Variety's film critic remarked on the casting, commenting about the "earthy quality to the relationship between Stewart and Miss Kelly. Both do a fine job of the picture's acting demands." She was awarded the role of Bing Crosby's long-suffering wife in The Country Girl, after a pregnant Jennifer Jones bowed out. Already familiar with the play, Kelly was desperate for the part. This meant that, to MGM's dismay, she would have to be loaned out to Paramount. Kelly threatened the studio that she would pack her bags and leave for New York for good. The vanquished studio caved in, and the part was hers. The Country Girl was shot in black and white, surprising an audience that had become accustomed to seeing the blonde in Technicolor. The film also paired Kelly again with William Holden. The wife of a washed-up alcoholic singer, played by Crosby, Kelly's character is emotionally torn between two lovers. Holden willfully begs Kelly to leave her husband and be with him. A piece of frail tenderness manages to cloak itself inside of her, even after having been demonized by Crosby, describing "a pathetic hint of frailty in a wonderful glowing man. That appeals a lot to us. It did to me. I was so young. His weaknesses seemed touching and sweet, they made me love him more." The following March, Kelly would be honored with the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her character's modest appearance and the film's demanding scenes were a departure from her on-screen persona of the graceful heiress, which she embodied through her last role in High Society, the musical remake of The Philadelphia Story. In April 1954, Kelly flew to Colombia for a brief 10-day shoot to film her next project, Green Fire, with Stewart Granger. Kelly plays Kathy Noland, an extremely small role as a coffee plantation owner. In Granger's autobiography he writes of his distaste for the film's script, while Kelly later confided to Hedda Hopper, "It wasn't pleasant. We worked at a pathetic village - miserable huts and dirty. Part of the crew got shipwrecked ... It was awful." Green Fire was a critical and box-office failure. After the back-to-back shooting of Rear Window, Toko-Ri, Country Girl, and Green Fire, Kelly was exhausted, and flew to France along with department store heir Bernard "Barney" Strauss, to begin work on her third and final film for Alfred Hitchcock, To Catch a Thief. Kelly formed a mutual admiration with her new co-star, Cary Grant. The two cherished the time together for the rest of their lives. Years later, when asked to name his all-time favorite actress, Cary replied without hesitation: "Well, with all due respect to dear Ingrid Bergman, I much preferred Grace. She had serenity."  The fireworks scene has been the subject of much commentary, as Hitchcock subliminally peppers an undertone of sexual innuendo during the sequence. In the now famous speedy picnic drive, dressed in a peach and white dress, with her trademark white gloves, Kelly's real life fear of driving and her inability to properly function an automobile, are captured on film. Though her film career lasted just five years and eleven films, Kelly is remembered as a premier actress in American film. In April 1955, Grace Kelly was asked to head the U.S. delegation at the Cannes Film Festival. While there, she was invited to participate in a photo session at the Palace of Monaco with Prince Rainier III, the ruling sovereign of the principality. After a series of delays and complications, Kelly was finally able to make it to Monaco, where she met the prince. Upon returning to America, Grace began work on her next feature film, The Swan, in which she coincidentally portrayed a princess. Meanwhile, she was privately beginning a correspondence with Rainier. In December, Rainier came to America on a trip officially designated as a tour, although it was speculated that Rainier was actively seeking a wife. A 1918 treaty with France stated that if Rainier did not produce an heir, Monaco would revert to France. At a press conference in the United States, Rainier was asked if he was pursuing a wife, to which he answered "No". A second question was asked, "If you were pursuing a wife, what kind would you like?" Rainier smiled and answered, "I don't know—the best." Rainier met with Grace and her family, and after three days, the prince proposed. Grace accepted and the families began preparing for what the press called "The Wedding of the Century". The wedding was set for April 19, 1956. News of the engagement was a sensation even though it meant the possible end to Grace's film career. Industry professionals realized that it would have been impractical for her to continue acting and wished her well. Alfred Hitchcock had quipped that he was, "very happy that Grace has found herself such a good part." Preparations for the wedding were elaborate. The Palace of Monaco was painted and redecorated throughout. The voyage of the American contingent to Monaco was an ordeal. On April 4, 1956, leaving from Pier 84 in New York Harbor, Grace, with her family, bridesmaids, poodle, and over eighty pieces of luggage boarded the ocean liner SS Constitution for the French Riviera. Some 400 reporters applied to sail, though most were turned away. Thousands of fans sent the party off for the 8 day voyage. In Monaco, more than twenty-thousand people lined the streets to greet the future princess.  The wedding consisted of two ceremonies. On April 18, a 40-minute civil ceremony took place in the Palace Throne Room, and was broadcast across Europe. To cap the ceremony, the 142 official titles (counterparts of Rainier's) that Kelly acquired in the union were formally recited. The following day, the event concluded with the church ceremony at Monaco's Saint Nicholas Cathedral. Grace's wedding dress, designed by MGM's Academy Award-winning Helen Rose, had been worked on by three dozen seamstresses for six weeks. The 600 guests included Hollywood stars David Niven and his wife Hjordis, Gloria Swanson, Ava Gardner, the crowned head Aga Khan, and Conrad Hilton. Frank Sinatra initially accepted the invitation to attend, but at the last minute decided otherwise, afraid of upstaging the bride on her wedding day. Queen Elizabeth flatly refused to attend on the grounds of there being "too many movie stars." The ceremony was watched by an estimated 30 million people on television. The prince and princess left that night for their 7-week Mediterranean cruise honeymoon on Rainier's yacht, Deo Juvante II. Nine months and four days after the wedding, Princess Grace gave birth to the royal couple's first child, Princess Caroline. 21 guns announced the event, a national holiday was called, gambling ceased, and free champagne flowed throughout the principality. A little over a year later, 101 guns announced the birth of their second child, Prince Albert. Prince Rainier and Princess Grace had three children:  Shortly after their marriage, Prince Rainier banned the screening of her films in Monaco.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000038/bio Princess Grace never returned to acting, choosing rather to fulfill her responsibilities as the consort of Monaco's Prince. In 1962, when Hitchcock offered Grace the lead in his film, Marnie, she was eager to take the opportunity to return to the screen. Rainier consented, but public outcry against her involvement made her reconsider and ultimately reject the project. Director Herbert Ross attempted to lure Princess Grace out of retirement for his 1977 The Turning Point, but Prince Rainier quashed the idea. Later that year, Grace returned to the arts in a series of poetry readings on stage and the narration of the documentary The Children of Theater Street.  She also narrated ABC's made-for-television film The Poppy Is Also a Flower (1966).  As princess, she was active in improving the arts institutions of Monaco, and eventually the Princess Grace Foundation was formed to support local artisans. She was one of the first celebrities to support and speak on behalf of La Leche League, an organization that advocates breastfeeding; she planned a yearly Christmas party for local orphans, and dedicated a Garden Club that reflected her love of flowers. In 1981, the Prince and Princess celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. Grace Kelly was the object of the tabloids and gossip throughout her life. Her love life was a particular focus of speculation. Stories of affairs circulated from her first major role in motion pictures and eventually included the names of almost every major actor at the time. Grace and the Shah of Iran became acquainted near the end of 1949 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel during the Shah's official visit to America. Grace's childhood friend (and later, her bridesmaid) Maree Frisby Rambo said in an interview with biographer Wendy Leigh that Kelly and the Shah had gone on at least six dates. The Shah had been the ruler of Iran since 1941, and was thirty years old at the time. The Shah besieged Kelly with vast amounts of jewelery including: a gold birdcage housing a diamond sapphire bird, a gold vanity case with a clasp set with thirty-two diamonds, and a gold bracelet with an intricate pearl and diamond face. Grace, however, had no intentions of marrying the Shah, and immediately sent the gifts back. She decided to keep the jewels and later presented the pieces to her bridesmaids as keepsakes on the eve of her wedding. Despite the alleged brutality of the Shah's regime, Grace fiercely defended him until his death. During the making of Dial M for Murder, Kelly seduced her co-star Ray Milland. Milland was 22 years older than she, but just as charming and suave as he was when she swooned over him years earlier as a teenager watching The Lost Weekend. Milland was married to Muriel Milland for thirty years, and the two had a son. Milland assured Kelly that he had left his wife, which she would later find out to have been a lie. After Muriel Milland found out about the affair, she and Ray Milland separated and Kelly was branded a homewrecker. Muriel Milland was one of the most popular wives in Hollywood and had the support of many friends, including gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. After Kelly gave a press interview explaining her side of the story, the town seemed to lose interest in the scandal. It was reported to the press that Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby met for the first time when they were introduced during the making of The Country Girl. This, however, was untrue. Sue Ladd, the widow of Alan Ladd, told Grace Kelly biographer James Spada that while Bing's then-wife Dixie was battling terminal cancer, Bing and Grace had been trysting in the Ladds' home.  What Kelly didn't know was that by the time filming commenced on The Country Girl, Crosby had already been dating actress Kathryn Grant. Three days before the date scheduled for Crosby's marriage to Grant, he confessed to having had an affair with Grace Kelly and that he no longer wished to marry her. Unbeknownst to Kelly, Bing had continued to express his love for Grant throughout their affair despite Kelly's determination to become Crosby's wife. Crosby later reconciled with Kathryn Grant and proposed to her once again, explaining to her that he had broken off the relationship with Grace Kelly. In a strange twist of fate, Russian fashion designer Oleg Cassini, having just seen Mogambo earlier that evening, encountered Grace Kelly having dinner at Le Veau d'Or. Cassini, who was raised in Florence, having an abundance of charm and courtliness and whose ex-wife was actress Gene Tierney, became just as captivated by Kelly in person as he had previously watching her in the film. Kelly's curiosity was soon piqued when she began receiving a bouquet of red roses every day. Cassini's persistence paid off when Kelly accepted his invitation to lunch, with the provision that she bring her sister Peggy along. Cassini and Kelly became engaged within the first month of meeting. Their desire to marry quickly was later revealed to have been prompted by the fact that she was pregnant. "The couple planned to have a small secret wedding, with Grace taking time off to have the baby," John Glatt wrote. "But at the last minute she changed her mind. Torn between her devout Catholic upbringing, her movie career and her love of Cassini, Grace decided she could not risk a scandal. So, instead of going through with the marriage, she had an abortion." When Cassini was asked by Glatt about the abortion, he remained defensive and evasive, commenting that, "It's too delicate a matter. I don't have to answer this and I will make no comment about that. Absolutely no comment. Let people think what they want to think," Cassini explained. In a 1960s interview, Kelly explained how she had grown to accept the scrutiny as a part of being in the public eye, but expressed concern for her children’s exposure to such relentless scandalmongering. After her death, celebrity biographers chronicled the rumors with renewed enthusiasm. Interviewed for British television by Michael Parkinson, David Niven recalled an awkward conversation with Prince Ranier in which the latter asked him who had been his most exciting lover. Niven began to say "Grace Kelly", but caught himself in time and answered "Gra..cie Fields". Fortunately, Ranier had never heard of Fields and didn't realise how absurd the suggestion was. In 1951, the newly famous Kelly took a bold stand against a racist incident involving Black American expatriate singer/dancer Josephine Baker, when the Sherman Billingsley's Stork Club in New York refused Baker as a customer. Kelly, who was dining at the club when this happened, was so disgusted that she rushed over to Baker (whom she had never met), took her by the arm, and stormed out with her entire party, vowing never to return (and she never did). The two women became close friends after that night. A significant testament to their close friendship was made evident when Baker was near bankruptcy, and was offered a villa and financial assistance by Kelly (who by that time had become Princess Grace), and her husband Rainier III of Monaco. The princess also encouraged Baker to return to performing, and even financed Baker's triumphant comeback in 1975, attending the opening night's performance.  On September 13, 1982, while driving with her daughter Stéphanie to Monaco from their country home, Princess Grace, then 52, drove her Rover P6http://www.channel4.com/4car/ft/feature/top+ten/1737/8 4Car Feature, Top Ten: Notorious cars off the serpentine down a mountainside. Princess Grace was pulled alive from the wreckage, but had suffered serious injuries and was unconscious. She died the following day at The Princess Grace Hospital Centre, having never regained consciousness. It was initially reported that Princess Stéphanie suffered only minor bruising, although it later emerged that she had suffered a serious cervical fracture.http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/14/newsid_2516000/2516601.stm BBC On This Day September 14th 1982 It was rumored that she had been driving on the same stretch of highway that had been featured in her 1955 movie To Catch a Thief; her son, HSH Albert II. of Monaco, has always denied it.http://www.popstarsplus.com/actress_gracekelly.htm Princess Grace was buried in the Grimaldi family vault on September 18, 1982, after a requiem mass in Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Monaco.http://www.britishcouncil.org/learnenglish-central-history-princess-grace.htm Prince Rainier, who never remarried after Kelly's death, was buried alongside her following his death in 2005. The 400 guests at the service included representatives of foreign governments and of present and past European royal houses, as well as several veteran US film stars. Nearly 100 million people worldwide watched her funeral.http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-09-10-grace-kelly_N.htm In his eulogy, James Stewart said: "You know, I just love Grace Kelly. Not because she was a princess, not because she was an actress, not because she was my friend, but because she was just about the nicest lady I ever met. Grace brought into my life as she brought into yours, a soft, warm light every time I saw her, and every time I saw her was a holiday of its own. No question, I'll miss her, we'll all miss her, God bless you, Princess Grace." The Princess Grace Foundation was founded in 1964 with the aim of helping those with special needs for whom no provision was made within the ordinary social services. In 1983, following Princess Grace's death, Caroline, Princess of Hanover assumed the duties of President of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation. Albert II, Prince of Monaco is Vice-President.http://www.palais.mc/wwwpal.nsf/c3241c4782f528bdc1256d52004f970b/8a1843f4fb454d97c1256ba60045b973?OpenDocument On June 18, 1984, Prince Rainier inaugurated a public rose garden in Monaco in Princess Grace's memory due to her passion for the flower.http://www.visitmonaco.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageID=173 In 1993, Princess Grace became the first U.S. actress to appear on a U.S. postage stamp.
