On February 28, 2008 Google launched the Google Sites wiki as a Google Apps component. Google has also developed several desktop applications, including Google Earth, an interactive mapping program powered by satellite and aerial imagery that covers the vast majority of the planet. Google Earth is generally considered to be remarkably accurate and extremely detailed. Many major cities have such detailed images that one can zoom in close enough to see vehicles and pedestrians clearly. Consequently, there have been some concerns about national security implications. Specifically, some countries and militaries contend the software can be used to pinpoint with near-precision accuracy the physical location of critical infrastructure, commercial and residential buildings, bases, government agencies, and so on. However, the satellite images are not necessarily frequently updated, and all of them are available at no charge through other products and even government sources. For example, NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Some counter this argument by stating that Google Earth makes it easier to access and research the images. Many other products are available through Google Labs, which is a collection of incomplete applications that are still being tested for use by the general public.

We think it's important to have a high density of people. People are packed together everywhere. We all share offices. We like this set of buildings because it's more like a densely packed university campus than a typical suburban office park."Vise, David A. "Tactics of 'Google Guys' Test IPO Law's Limits." Washington Post. August 17, 2004. Retrieved on February 23, 2007. However, many analysts are finding that as Google grows, the company is becoming more "corporate". In 2005, articles in The New York Times and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.Rivlin, Gary. "Relax, Bill Gates; It's Google's Turn as the Villain." New York Times. August 24, 2005.Gibson, Owen; Wray, Richard. "Search giant may outgrow its fans." The Sydney Morning Herald.

In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google has designated a Chief Culture Officer in 2006, who also serves as the Director of Human Resources. The purpose of the Chief Culture Officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on in the beginning — a flat organization, a lack of hierarchy, a collaborative environment.Mills, Elinor. "Meet Google's culture czar." ZDNet. April 30, 2007. Retrieved on April 30, 2007.  In 2004, Google formed a non-profit philanthropic wing, Google.org, with a start-up fund of US$1 billion."About the Foundation." Google.org. Retrieved on October 11, 2007. The express mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects is to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 mpg. The founding and current director is Dr. Larry Brilliant.Hafner, Katie.

As it has grown, Google has found itself the focus of several controversies related to its business practices and services. For example, Google Book Search's effort to digitize millions of books and make the full text searchable has led to copyright disputes with the Authors Guild. Google's cooperation with the governments of China, and to a lesser extent France and Germany (regarding Holocaust denial) to filter search results in accordance to regional laws and regulations has led to claims of censorship. Google's persistent cookie and other information collection practices have led to concerns over user privacy. As of December 11, 2007, Google, like the Microsoft search engine, stores "personal information for 18 months" and by comparison, Yahoo! and AOL (Time Warner) "retain search requests for 13 months". A number of Indian state governments have raised concerns about the security risks posed by geographic details provided by Google Earth's satellite imaging.Sharma, Dinesh C. "Indian president warns against Google Earth." c net. October 17, 2005. Retrieved on July 23, 2006. Google has also been criticized by advertisers regarding its inability to combat click fraud, when a person or automated script is used to generate a charge on an advertisement without really having an interest in the product. Industry reports in 2006 claim that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were in fact fraudulent or invalid.Mills, Elinor. "Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats." c net. July 25, 2006. Retrieved on July 29, 2006. Further, Google has faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.Kawamoto, Dawn. "Google hit with job discrimination lawsuit." c|net news.com.
