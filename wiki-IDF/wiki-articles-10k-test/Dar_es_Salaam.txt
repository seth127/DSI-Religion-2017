 This article is about the city. For the region, see Dar es Salaam (region).  For the 2000 Chadian film, see Daresalam. Dar es Salaam ( [translation: "Abode of Peace"] Dār as-Salām, cf. "Yer u-salem"), formerly Mzizima, is the largest city in Tanzania.  It is also the country's richest city and a regionally important economic centre.  Dar es Salaam is actually an administrative province within Tanzania, and consists of three local government areas or administrative districts:  Kinondoni to the north, Ilala in the center of the region, and Temeke to the south.  The Dar es Salaam Region had a population of 2,497,940 as of the official 2002 census.  Though Dar es Salaam lost its official status as capital city to Dodoma in 1996, it remains the centre of the permanent central government bureaucracy and continues to serve as the capital for the surrounding Dar es Salaam Region. In 1859, Albert Roscher of Hamburg became the first European to land in Mzizima ("healthy town"). In 1866 Sultan Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar gave it its present name, an Arabic phrase meaning Abode of Peace. A popular but erroneous translation is "haven of peace" resulting from a mixup of the Arabic words "dar" (house) and "bandar" (harbour). Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887, when the German East Africa Company established a station there. The town's growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of German East Africa and industrial expansion resulting from the construction of the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s. German East Africa was captured by the British during World War I and from then on was referred to as Tanganyika. Dar es Salaam was retained as the territory's administrative and commercial centre. Under British indirect rule, separate European (e.g. Oyster Bay) and African (e.g. Kariakoo and Ilala) areas developed at a distance from the city centre. The town's population also included a large number of South Asians. After World War II, Dar es Salaam experienced a period of rapid growth. Political developments, including the formation and growth of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), led to Tanganyika attaining independence from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, also when in 1964 Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form Tanzania. However, in 1973 provisions were made to relocate the capital to Dodoma, a more centrally located city in Tanzania's interior. The relocation process has not yet been completed, and Dar es Salaam remains Tanzania's primary city. One of the deadly 1998 U.S. embassy bombings occurred in Dar es Salaam; the other was in Nairobi, Kenya.   Dar es Salaam is located at 6°48'&nbsp;South, 39°17'&nbsp;East (−6.8000, 39.2833). [ ] The city is situated on a massive natural harbour on the Eastern Indian Ocean coast of Africa. Administratively, Dar es Salaam is broken into 3 districts: Ilala, Kinondoni, and Temeke. Being situated so close to the equator and the warm Indian ocean, the city experiences generally tropical climatic conditions, typified by hot and humid weather throughout much of the year. Annual rainfall is approximately  per annum and in a normal year there are two distinct rainy seasons, 'the long rains' which fall during April and May, and 'the short rains' - during October and November. The population is increasing at a rate of 4.39% annually (the 3rd fastest in Africa and the 9th fastest in the world). The metro population is expected to reach 5.12 million by 2020. (www.citymayors.com/statistics).       Dar is Tanzania's most important city for both business and government. The city contains unusually high concentrations of trade and other services and manufacturing compared to other parts of Tanzania, which has about 80 percent of its population in rural areas. For example, about one half of Tanzania's manufacturing employment is located in the city despite the fact that Dar holds only ten percent of Tanzania's population. Located on a natural harbour on the Indian Ocean, it is the hub of the Tanzanian transportation system as all of the country's main railways and several highways originate in or near the city. Its status as an administrative and trade centre has put Dar es Salaam in position to benefit disproportionately from Tanzania's high growth rate since the year 2000 so that by now its poverty rates are much lower than the rest of the country. The Julius Nyerere International Airport connects the city with other African countries, the Middle East, India, as well as Europe. Downtown Dar es Salaam is a busy commercial area of town. The area includes many small businesses, many of which are run by traders and proprietors whose families originated from the Middle East and Indian sub-continent - areas of the world with which the settlements of the Tanzanian coast have had long-standing trading relations. During the daytime the heavy weight of traffic, office workers, busy merchants, street vendors and restaurateurs of the area lend it a frenetic and slightly claustrophobic air. However, after nightfall the area is relatively quiet as much of the city's nightlife is located in more residential districts away from the city's mainly commercial centre. The sprawling suburbs furthest from the city centre are generally populated by Tanzanians of African descent, with the exception of Oyster Bay, where there is a large population of foreign expatriates. Although there is little in the way of open racial hostility, the various ethnic communities of Dar es Salaam do not tend to mix heavily. The edges of Dar es Salaam are spreading rapidly, severely taxing the transportation network (which aside from ferries, lacks any kind of mass transit facilities) and raising the prospect of future urban overcrowding. Due in part to the growth of the expatriate community and the increasing importance of tourism, the number of international restaurants has risen very rapidly over recent years. The city now offers a surprisingly rich and internationalised diversity of cuisine, ranging from traditional Tanzanian barbecue style options such as "Nyama Choma" (roasted meat) and "Mishkaki" (Shish Kabob - usually barbecued and served with salt and various hot peppers on the side) and the long-established traditional Indian and Zanzibari cuisine, to options from all corners of the globe including, Chinese, Thai, Turkish, Italian, and Japanese food. There is also a lively music scene in Dar es Salaam which is divided among several styles. The longest standing segment is live dance bands such as Kilimanjaro, Twanga Pepeta and FM Academia. Taarab which was traditionally strong in Zanzibar has also found a niche but remains small compared both to dance music and "Bongo Flava", a broad category that represents the Tanzanian take on Hip Hop and R&B, which has quickly become the most popular locally produced music. This type of music is especially strong among the youth and it seems that its pull is reducing the interest in performing and hearing dance music. Songs by artists such as Ferooz name check Dar districts such as Sinza. Traditional music, which locally is used to refer to tribal music is still performed but typically only on family oriented occasions such as weddings. Much like the popular music of other major cities Dar es Salaam's hip music of the day Bongo Flava is a cultural escape for youths that speaks to topics of everyday life such as "HIV/AIDS, scraping a life together, the difficulty of meeting basic needs, class and wealth barriers, holding your head high despite everything."  http://www.afropop.org/explore/album_review/ID/2604/Bongo+Flava:+Swahili+Rap+from+Tanzania  This Rap scene has been present and growing for the past ten years as City life has drawn much of the youth in surrounding areas have made the trek into a more urban lifestyle in search of a new better beginning.  http://www.africanhiphop.com/update/halisi.htm  In the 1970s the Ministry of National Youth Culture aimed to create a national culture, which stressed the importance of music.  Dar es Salaam became the new music center in Tanzania, with the local radio exposing new bands and dominating the music and cultural scene.   With this ujamaa, or family, mentality governing culture and music a unified people’s culture was created.  However, with the intervention of the IMF and World Bank, Dar es Salaam became a center of city crime, gangs, and violence, which lead to the rise of hip hop music.

By Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 230-254: London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press   Throughout the years, the radio en Dar es Salaam has played a major role in the dissemination of music because many people don’t have televisions and cassettes are used over CD’s.  In addition, creating music in Dar es Salaam involves pure dedication because they receive little pay due to inadequate copyright laws.  In addition, most rappers in Dar es Salaam are literate and well educated. http://www.musikmuseet.se/mmm/africa/ A variety of museums, including the National Museum, the Village Museum and the Botanical Garden are all very close by. Within an hour's drive north is Bagamoyo, which is home to the Kaole ruins. There are beaches on the Kigamboni peninsula east of Dar es Salaam and on Kigamboni Island to the north where residents and tourists alike frequently visit. Trips to the nearby islands of the  Dar es Salaam Marine Reserve are a popular daytrip from the city and a favourite spot for snorkeling, swimming and sunbathing. The National Stadium hosts Dar es Salaam's Young Africans Football Club, Simba football club, Other Tanzanian football clubs, and many other international matches. The first cineplex in Tanzania to show first-run Western and Indian releases was opened in Dar es Salaam in December 2003. Globalization has affected many of the cultural expressions in Dar es Salaam, in particular, hip hop music and culture.  The hip hop scene in Dar es Salaam articulates a blending of local cultural struggles and the indigenization of global influences. Lemelle, Sidney J. “‘Ni wapi Tunakwenda’: Hip Hop Culture and the Children of Arusha.” In The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 230-54. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Pres Hip hop music and culture arrived in Tanzania, taking its cues from various African American styling.  Birgit Quade, highlights Tanzanian hip hop’s connection to US culture when she writes:  “What makes hip-hop a global phenomenon is that its draws upon style, music, and look that is not restricted to any local region or language…In the mid-1980s, young people who saw the first hip-hop films and videos coming from America and started break-dancing and rapping.”  http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/426/Dar+es+Salaam-Hip+Hop-2004  The adaptations of language, fashion, style, and content within Tanzanian hip hop culture have evolved gradually.  The result of this evolution has created a localized form of hip hop, often showcasing native dialectic lyrical performances and traditional garbs.  While hip hop in Dar es Salaam is a clear reflection of Tanzanian localized struggle and culture, it also engages in and compromises with aspects of Western culture. Dar es Salaam is also the educational centre of Tanzania. The city is home to the University of Dar es Salaam, the Open University of Tanzania, the Hubert Kairuki Memorial University (HKMU) as well as the International Medical and Technological University (IMTU). Other institutes of higher education include the Institute of Financial Management (IFM), Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) and the College of Business Education (CBE). Dar es Salaam also boasts some of the finest schools in Tanzania. The following are schools that provide secondary education, O Levels and A Levels in Tanzania, according to the NECTA (National Examination Council Of Tanzania) syllabus. Some of the International Schools in Dar are IST, International School of Tanganyka,HOPAC, Haven of Peace Academy, Dar es Salaam International Academy (DIA),DIS, Dar es Salaam International School, and Laureate.   frp:Dar es Salam pms:Dar es Salaam simple:Dar es Salaam vec:Dar es Salaam 1925: 30,000 1948: 69,000 1957: 129,000 1972: 396,000 2005: 2,456,100  :LINKNUM:67
