    A language is a system of visual, auditory, or tactile symbols of communication and the rules used to manipulate them. Language can also refer to the use of such systems as a general phenomenon. Language is considered to be an exclusively human mode of communication; although other animals make use of quite sophisticated communicative systems, none of these are known to make use of all of the properties that linguists use to define language. It can also refer to the use of such systems as a general phenomenon. A set of agreed-upon symbols is only one feature of language; all languages must define the structural relationships between these symbols in a system of grammar.  Rules of grammar are what distinguish language from other forms of communication. They allow a finite set of symbols to be manipulated to create a potentially infinite number of grammatical utterances. Another property of language is that the symbols used are arbitrary. Any concept or grammatical rule can be mapped onto a symbol.  Most languages make use of sound, but the combinations of sounds used do not have any inherent meaning - they are merely an agreed-upon convention to represent a certain thing by users of that language. For instance, there is nothing about the Spanish word  itself that forces Spanish speakers to use it to mean "nothing".  Another set of sounds - for example, English nothing - could equally be used to represent the same concept.  Nevertheless, all Spanish speakers have memorized that meaning for that sound pattern. But for Croatian, Serbian or Bosnian speakers,  means, "hope". However, even though in principle the symbols are arbitrary, this does not mean that a language cannot have symbols that are iconic of what they stand for. Words such as "meow" sound similar to what they represent (see Onomatopoeia), but they do not necessarily have to do so in order to be understood.  Many languages use different onomatopoeias as the agreed convention to represent the sounds a cat makes.   Human languages are usually referred to as natural languages, and the science of studying them is linguistics. A common progression for natural languages is that they are first spoken, then written, and then an understanding and explanation of their grammar (according to speech) is attempted. Languages live, die, move from place to place, and change with time. Any language that stops changing begins to die ; sometimes members of marginalized groups hold that it is a living language in a state of continuous change. Making a principled distinction between one language and another is usually impossible.  For instance, there are a few dialects of German similar to some dialects of Dutch. The transition between languages within the same language family is sometimes gradual (see dialect continuum). Some like to make parallels with biology, where it is not possible to make a well-defined distinction between one species and the next. In either case, the ultimate difficulty may stem from the interactions between languages and populations. (See Dialect or August Schleicher for a longer discussion.) The concepts of Ausbausprache, Abstandsprache and Dachsprache are used to make finer distinctions about the degrees of difference between languages or dialects. Some languages are meant specifically for communication between people of different nationalities or language groups. Several of these languages have been constructed by individuals or groups. Natural, pre-existing languages may also be used in this way - their developers merely catalogued and standardized their vocabulary and identified their grammatical rules. These languages are called naturalistic. One such language, Latino Sine Flexione, is a simplified form of Latin. Another, Occidental, was drawn from several Western languages. To date, the most successful auxiliary language is Esperanto, invented by Polish ophthalmologist Zamenhof.  It has about 2 million speakers worldwide, hundreds of songs have been sung in it, and a vast amount of literature has been written in it. The Stone City, for example, was originally written in Esperanto. Other auxiliary languages with important groups of speakers are Interlingua and Ido (however, the latter is believed to have only a few hundred speakers). Controlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity. The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled natural language typically is to aid non-native speakers of a natural language in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a natural language. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is Simplified English, which was originally developed for aerospace industry maintenance manuals. Some individuals and groups have constructed their own artificial languages, for practical, experimental, personal, or ideological reasons.  For example, one prominent artificial language, Esperanto, was created by L. L. Zamenhof as a compilation of various elements of different languages, and is supposed to be an easy-to-learn language for people familiar with similar, mostly Indo-European, languages.  Other constructed languages strive to be more logical  ("loglangs") than natural languages; a prominent example of this is Lojban. Both of these languages are intended to be international auxiliary languages. Some writers, such as J. R. R. Tolkien, have created fantasy languages, for literary, artistic or personal reasons.  The fantasy language of the Klingon race has in recent years been developed by fans of the Star Trek series, including a vocabulary and grammar. Constructed languages are not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by natural languages. Mathematics and computer science use artificial entities called formal languages (including programming languages and markup languages, and some that are more theoretical in nature). These often take the form of character strings, produced by a combination of formal grammar and semantics of arbitrary complexity. A programming language is an extreme case of a formal language that can be used to control the behavior of a machine, particularly a computer, to perform specific tasks. Programming languages are defined using syntactic and semantic rules, to determine structure and meaning respectively. Programming languages are used to facilitate communication about the task of organizing and manipulating information, and to express algorithms precisely. Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms; sometimes the term "computer language" is used for artificial languages that are more limited.  The historical record of linguistics begins in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century BCE grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology, known as the  (अष्टाध्यायी) and with Tolkāppiyar, the 3rd century BCE grammarian of the Tamil work Tolkāppiyam.  grammar is highly systematized and technical. Inherent in its analytic approach are the concepts of the phoneme, the morpheme, and the root; Western linguists only recognized the phoneme some two millennia later. Tolkāppiyar's work is perhaps the first to describe articulatory phonetics for a language. Its classification of the alphabet into consonants and vowels, and elements like nouns, verbs, vowels, and consonants, which he put into classes, were also breakthroughs at the time. In the Middle East, the Persian linguist Sibawayh (سیبویه) made a detailed and professional description of Arabic in 760 CE in his monumental work, Al-kitab fi al-nahw (الكتاب في النحو, The Book on Grammar), bringing many linguistic aspects of language to light. In his book, he distinguished phonetics from phonology. Later in the West, the success of science, mathematics, and other formal systems in the 20th century led many to attempt a formalization of the study of language as a "semantic code". This resulted in the academic discipline of linguistics, the founding of which is attributed to Ferdinand de Saussure.  In the 20th century, substantial contributions to the understanding of language came from Ferdinand de Saussure, Hjelmslev, Émile Benveniste and Roman Jakobson,Holquist 1981, xvii-xviii which are characterized as being highly systematic. The term "animal languages" is often used for nonhuman languages.  Linguists do not consider these to be language, but describe them as animal communication, because the interaction between animals in such communication is fundamentally different in its underlying principles from true language, which has been found in humans only. In several publicized instances, nonhuman animals have been taught to understand certain features of human language. Chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans have been taught hand signs based on American Sign Language; however, they have never been successfully taught grammar. In 2003, a saved Bonobo ape named Kanzi allegedly independently created some words to convey certain concepts, however the careful examination of other apes raised in a similar manner (Washoe, Koko, and Nim Chimpsky) shows a greater degree of anthropormorphism and selective observation on the part of trainers and a lack of initiative and high levels of simple imitative behaviour with the subjects. The African Grey Parrot, which possesses the ability to mimic human speech with a high degree of accuracy, is suspected of having sufficient intelligence to comprehend some of the speech it mimics. Most species of parrot, despite expert mimicry, are believed to have no linguistic comprehension at all. While proponents of animal communication systems have debated levels of semantics, these systems have not been found to have anything approaching human language syntax. The situation with dolphins and whales presents a special case in that there is some evidence that spontaneous development of complex vocal language is occurring, but it certainly has not been proven. Some researchers argue that a continuum exists among the communication methods of all social animals, pointing to the fundamental requirements of group behavior and the existence of mirror neurons in primates. This, however, is still a scientific question. Most researchers agree that, although human and more primitive languages have analogous features, they are not homologous.          als:Sprache frp:Lengua ast:Idioma zh-min-nan:Gí-giân map-bms:Basa be-x-old:Мова bar:Sprache ceb:Pinulongan pdc:Schprooch fur:Lengaç ilo:Pagsasao jbo:bangu mzn:Zivan cdo:Ngṳ̄-ngiòng nrm:Laungue ksh:Sprooch rmy:Chhib sco:Leid scn:Lingua (parràta) simple:Language stq:Sproake fiu-vro:Keeleq zh-yue:話 diq:Zıwan (lisan) bat-smg:Kalba tlh:Hol Autism Base language Broca's area - a speech-related brain region Cochlear implant Communication Computer-assisted language learning - a historical perspective Deception Dialect Dictionary - word catalog for a given language Extinct language Foreign language FOXP2 - gene implicated in cases of specific language impairment (SLI) General-audience description Great ape language Historical linguistics ILR scale - defines 5 levels of language proficiency Intercultural competence Interpreting ISO 639-3 - 3-letter ID codes for all languages ISO 639 - 2- and 3-letter ID codes for languages Language education Language-predicated educational games Language policy Language reform Language school Linguistic protectionism Metacommunicative competence Name Non-sexist language Non-verbal communication Official language Orthography Philology Philosophy of language Phonetic transcription Profanity Psycholinguistics Sapir–Whorf hypothesis Second language Slang Speech therapy Symbolic communication Symbolic linguistic representation Terminology Thesaurus - find the best word for a situation Tongue-twister Transition words Translation Universal grammar Verbal abuse Visual language Whistled language Written language Ethnologue - list of languages, locations, population and genetic affiliation List of basic linguistics topics List of language academies List of languages List of official languages Crystal, David (1997).
