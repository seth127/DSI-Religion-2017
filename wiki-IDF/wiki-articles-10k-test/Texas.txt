      Texas () is a state geographically located in the south-central part of the United States, which the Census Bureau places in a sub-region of the U.S. South designated West South Central. It is also known as the Lone Star State. With an area of  and a rapidly growing population of 23.5 million, as estimated in 2006, spread among 254 counties, Texas is the second largest U.S. state in both area and population. Dallas and Houston are the centers of the state's two largest metropolitan areas. Other major cities include the state capital of Austin, the state's oldest major city of San Antonio, and the western city of El Paso.[ ]   Due to its long history as a center of the American cattle industry, Texas is associated throughout much of the world with the image of the cowboy. Topographically, the easternmost section of the state is covered by the same Piney Woods that cover much of the Deep South. Moving westward, this evolves into semi-forests of oak and cross timbers then, as the climate gradually becomes more arid, turns into rolling plains and prairie and, eventually, desert in the Big Bend region surrounding El Paso. It is these wide open spaces of the Texas prairie that have lent currency to the phrase that "everything is bigger in Texas." Because of its large size and unique history, the regional affiliation of Texas is often debated. Historically and culturally, it has very close ties to the South. However, due to Texas's history as a Spanish colony, its border with Mexico, and its large Latino population, Texas can also be considered a Southwestern state.  Nevertheless, while most residents acknowledge these categories, many claim an independent "Texan" identity superseding regional labels. Spain was the first European country to claim Texas. Starting in the 1820s, North American and European immigrants began arriving in the area, and in 1836 Texas declared its independence from Mexico, and continued to exist as the independent Republic of Texas for nearly a decade. In 1845, it joined the United States as the 28th state. Texas is one of only four independent states to enter the US federation. Annexation of Texas led the United States to war with Mexico leading to the Mexican Cession and helping to plant seeds for the U.S. Civil War. Texas was the 7th state to join the Confederate States of America. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, discovery of oil led to an economic boom in the state and greatly increased funding for higher education.  Texas grew rapidly, becoming the second largest state in population by  1994, and became economically diversified, with a growing base in high technology. The state's name derives from , a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, which means "friends" or "allies".Wallace Chafe, p.c. The word Texas has found its way into the American English vernacular in ways not directly related to the actual state. Due to the state's large geographic size, the term "Texas sized" is often used to describe large things.  The state's name has been used as part of several brands such as the Louisville, Kentucky restaurant chain, Texas Roadhouse, and the multinational semiconductor corporation, Texas Instruments. Texas Hold 'Em is the most popular form of poker in the world. A shortened form of "Texas", Tex, has been used as a nickname for someone having been born and/or raised in the state. Some people nicknamed "Tex" include basketball coach Tex Winter and original Dallas Cowboys president and general manager Tex Schramm. Tex also has been used as a prefix for several words related to Texas including Tex-Mex or the city Texarkana. The common nickname for the state, The Lone Star State comes from the single star of the former Republic of Texas.  The star is still found on the state seal and flag, symbolizing Texas's fight for independence and that Texas was an independent republic.   Prior to European colonization, Texas was inhabited by Native American nations such as the Caddo, Comanche and Apache. Spain was the first European country to claim the territory of Texas. Starting in the 1820s, American and European immigrants began arriving in the area. Mexico declared its independence from Spain, and Texas declared its independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836. Following this date, Texas existed as the independent republic for nearly a decade. In 1845, it joined the United States as the 28th state. Texas is one of only four independent states to enter the US federation. Annexation of Texas led the United States to war with Mexico leading to the Mexican Cession. In the American Civil War, Texas was the 7th state to join the Confederate States of America. Near the turn of the 20th century, discovery of oil led to an economic boom in the state.  Texas grew rapidly, becoming the second largest state in population 1994, diversifying its economy, with a growing base in high technology.   Texas boasts that "Six Flags" have flown over its soil: the national flags of Spain, the Fleur-de-lis of France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the Confederate States of America, and the United States of America. American Indian tribes who once lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Comanche, Cherokee, Kiowa, Tonkawa, Wichita, Hueco and the Karankawa of Galveston. Currently, there are three federally recognized Native American tribes which reside in Texas: the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas, and the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas.  Alonso Álvarez de Pineda, creator of the first map of the northern Gulf Coast, made the first documented European sighting of Texas in 1519.Chipman (1992), p. 243. Weber (1992), p. 34.  On 6 November 1528, shipwrecked Spanish conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca became the first known European in Texas. Texas was immediately claimed by Spain as part of New Spain.  but was not settled immediately. In 1685 La Salle established the first European community in Texas, the French colony of Fort Saint Louis.Weber (1992), p. 149. The colony, located along Matagorda Bay, lasted only four&nbsp;years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.Chipman (1992), p. 83. Due to the perceived French encroachment, Spain established its first presence in Texas in 1691 constructing of several missions in East Texas.Chipman (1992), p. 89.  The missions failed quickly, and Spain did not resettle Texas until two&nbsp;decades had passed.Weber (1992), p. 155.  Spain returned to East Texas in 1716, establishing several missions and a presidio to maintain a buffer between Mexico and the French territory of Louisiana.Chipman (1992), pp. 111&ndash;112.Weber (1992), p. 160.   Two&nbsp;years later, the first civilian settlement in Texas, San Antonio, was established as a way station between the missions and the nearest existing Spanish settlement.Weber (1992), p. 163.   San Antonio quickly became a target for raids by the Lipan Apache.Weber (1992), p. 188.  In 1749, the Spanish signed a peace treaty with the Apache,Weber (1992), p. 193. which angered the enemies of the Apache and resulted in raids by the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes.Weber (1992), p. 189.  Fear of Indian attacks and remoteness from the rest of the kingdom discouraged settlers from moving to Texas, and it remained one of the least populated provinces of New Spain.Chipman (1992), p. 205. The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785Weddle (1995), p. 163. and later assisted in defeating the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes which had continued to cause difficulties for Spanish settlers.Weddle (1995), p. 164.Chipman (1992), p. 200.  An increase in the number of missions in the province allowed for a peaceful conversion of other tribes, and by the end of the 1700s only a few of the hunting and gathering tribes had not been Christianized.Chipman (1992), p. 202. Although Spain also held Louisiana for several years, in 1799 it ceded the neighboring territory back to France.  Napoleon selling of Louisiana to the United States the following year, led to a border dispute of Texas.Weber (1992), p. 291.  U.S. President Thomas Jefferson insisted that the purchase included all land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande.Weber (1992), p. 292.  The dispute was resolved in 1819, with the signing of the Adams-Onís Treaty recognizing the Sabine River as Texas's eastern boundary.Weber (1992), p. 299.  Two years later, the state became a province of Mexico after the Mexican War of Independence.Weber (1992), p. 300.  Moses Austin was the first Anglo American to receive permission to settle in Texas, but died before he could bring settlers to Texas.  His son, Stephen F. Austin, continued his father's work. In 1821, Texas became part of the newly independent Republic of Mexico and, in 1824, became the northern section of Coahuila y Tejas. Spain's policy of allowing only full-blooded Spaniards to settle Texas also ended with Mexico's independence. On 3 January 1823, Stephen F. Austin began a colony of 297 Anglo-American families known as the "Old Three Hundred" along the Brazos River, after Austin was authorized to do so by Governor Antonio María Martínez and then successive Mexican officials as Mexico went through tumultuous political regime changes. Austin soon organized even more groups of immigrants, with authorization from the Mexican government. By 1830, the 30,000 Anglo settlers in Texas outnumbered Tejanos two to one.  The Convention of 1832 and the Convention of 1833 were responses to rising unrest at policies of the Mexican government, which included ending duty free imports from the United States and the threat of losing a special allowance for slavery in the state. Slavery was abolished in Mexico after its independence. In 1835, Antonio López de Santa Anna, President of Mexico, proclaimed a unified constitution for all Mexican territories, including Texas. The new Constitution ended the republic and the federation, imposed a central style of government with power concentrated in the President, and turned states into provinces with governors appointed from Mexico City. Some states around Mexico rebelled against this imposition, including Chihuahua, Zacatecas and Yucatan. Texans were also irritated by other policies including the forcible disarmament of Texan settlers, and the expulsion of immigrants and legal landowners originally from the United States.  Centralista forces' suppression of dissidents in Zacatecas also inspired fear of the Mexican government.  On 2 March 1836, the Convention of 1836 signed a Declaration of Independence.Unanimous Declaration of Independence On 21 April 1836, the Texans&mdash;led by General Sam Houston&mdash;won their independence at the Battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna's capture led to the Treaties of Velasco, which gave Texas firm boundaries; Mexico repudiated the treaties, considered Texas a breakaway province, and vowed to reconquer it. Later in 1836, the Texans adopted a constitution that formally legalized slavery. The Republic of Texas included the area of the present state of Texas, and additional unoccupied territory to the west and northwest.  Most Texans wanted their Republic to be annexed into the United States because of the Republic's defensive and financial difficulties. Events such as the Dawson Massacre and two recaptures of Béxar in Texas of 1842 added momentum to the desire for statehood. However, strong Northern opposition to adding another slave state blocked Texas's admission until pro-annexation James K. Polk won the election of 1844. On 29 December 1845, Texas was admitted to the U.S. as a constituent state of the Union. Texas was the only state to enter the United States by treaty instead of territorial annexation. The Mexican–American War followed, with decisive victories by the U.S. Post war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.  Just before the American Civil War, elected delegates met in convention and authorized secession from the U.S. on 1 February 1861. Texas voters later approved the measure in referendum, and the state was accepted as a charter member by the provisional government of the Confederate States of America on 1 March 1861. Partly due to its distance from the front lines of the war, a major role for Texas was to supply men, especially cavalry, for Confederate forces, many veterans of the Mexican–American War. Texan regiments fought in every major battle throughout the war. Texas was a "supply state" for the Confederate forces until mid-1863, when the Union capture of the Mississippi River made large movements of men or cattle impossible. The last battle of the Civil War was fought in Texas, at Palmito Ranch, on 12 May 1865, at least a  month after the surrender of the Confederate armies in the eastern theatres of war. Texas descended into near-anarchy during the two months between the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger, as Confederate forces demobilized or disbanded and government property passed into private hands through distribution or plunder. Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation on 19 June 1865 in Galveston by General Gordon Granger; over 2-1/2 years after the original announcement of 1 January 1863. President Johnson, on 20 August 1866, declared that civilian government had been restored to Texas.[ ]  On 30 March 1870 the Congress readmitted Texas into the Union, despite not meeting all reconstruction requirements.  The first major oil well in Texas was Spindletop, a little hill south of Beaumont, on the morning of 10 January 1901. Other oil fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas, West Texas, and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting “Oil Boom” permanently transformed the economy of Texas. Oil production eventually averaged three million barrels of oil per day at its peak in 1972. The economy, which had shown significant progress since the American Civil War, was dealt a double blow by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. From 1950 through the 1960s, Texas modernized and dramatically expanded its system of higher education. Under the leadership of Governor John B. Connally, the state created a long-range plan for higher education, a more rational distribution of resources, and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently. These changes, helped Texas universities receive federal research funds during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.Blanton, Carlos Kevin. "The Campus and the Capitol: John B. Connally and the Struggle over Texas Higher Education Policy, 1950-1970" Southwestern Historical Quarterly 2005 108(4): 468-497. ISSN 0038-478X   The geography of Texas spans a wide range of features and timelines.   Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico. It is in the south-central part of the United States of America. It is considered to form part of the U.S. South and also part of the U.S. Southwest. The Rio Grande, Red River and Sabine River all provide natural state lines where Texas borders Oklahoma on the north, Louisiana and Arkansas on the east, & the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south.  But to the west, the borders with the State of New Mexico & with the panhandle of Oklahoma are not based on natural features of terrain. Some residents divide Texas into five regions: North, East, Central, South, and West. Texas Almanac divides Texas into four physical regions: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and The Basin and Range Province. This is the difference between human geography and physical geography. Some regions of Texas are more associated with the South than the Southwest (primarily East Texas, Central Texas, and North Texas), while others share more similarities with the latter (primarily far West Texas and South Texas). The upper Texas Panhandle and the South Plains parts of West Texas do not easily fit into either category. The former has much in common with the Midwestern United States, while the latter, originally settled primarily by anglo Southerners, yet with a notable Hispanic population, is somewhat of a blend of South and Southwest. The size of Texas prohibits easy categorization of the entire state wholly in any recognized region of the United States; geographic, economic, and even cultural diversity between regions of the state preclude treating Texas as a region in its own right.   Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The continental crust here is a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old. These Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underly most of the state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. This is overlain by mostly sedimentary rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time. This margin existed until Laurasia and Godwana collided in Pennsylvanian time to form Pangea. This is the buried crest of the Appalachian Mountains&mdash;Ouachita Mountains&mdash;Marathon Mountains zone of Pennsylvanian continental collision. This orogenic crest is today buried beneath the Dallas&mdash;Waco&mdash;Austin&mdash;San Antonio trend. During this time E. Texas was a region of high mountains and shallow seas covered W. Texas. The late Paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in Jurassic time began to open the Gulf of Mexico. Pangea began to break up in the Triassic but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid and late Jurassic. The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico passive margin began to form. Today there are  to  of sediments buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are to be found here. At the start of its formation, the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age. These salt deposits have buoyantly risen up through the passive margin sediments to form salt dome diapirs, commonly found  in East Texas, along the Gulf coast. East Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments with contain important deposits of Eocenelignite.  Oil is found in the Mississippian ad Pennsylvanian sediments in the north, Permian sediments in the west, Cretaceous sediments in the east, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf. Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas, in the Big Bend area. A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active plate tectonic boundary.   The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of several climate zones gives the state highly variable weather. In general, though, there are three main climate zones: the humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa) of the eastern half of Texas, the temperate semi-arid (Koppen BSk) steppe climate of the northwestern part, including the Panhandle, and the subtropical steppe climate (nearly an arid desert climate, Koppen BSh) of the southern parts of West Texas, particularly around El Paso. The Panhandle of the state is colder in winter than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters. Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns. El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages as little as  of annual rainfall while Houston, on the southeast Texas averages as much as  per year.Weather. Handbook of Texas Online. Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate  per year. Snowfall often falls in the winter months in the north. Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s °F (26 °C) in the mountains of West Texas and on Galveston Island to around  in the Rio Grande Valley. Nighttime summer temperatures range from the upper 50s °F (14 °C) in the West Texas mountainsMonthly Averages for Marfa, TX weather.com to  in Galveston.Monthly Averages for Galveston, TX. weather.com. Thunderstorms are very common in Texas, especially the eastern and northern portion of the state. Texas also experiences the highest number of tornadoes out of every state in the Union, with an average of around 139 a year. Although these tend to strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle, every part of the state is subject to these violent storms. [ ] NOAA National Climatic Data Center. Retrieved on 24 October 2006.  Tornadoes occur mostly between the months of April-July but may strike at any time of the year. Texas emits the most greenhouse gases out of any state. The state's annual carbon dioxide emissions are nearly 1.5 trillion pounds (680 billion kg). Texas would be the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases if it were its own country.  Much of the greenhouse gas emissions come from the state's refining and manufacturing industries which provide the bulk of the United States's petroleum and plastics.   As of 2006, the state has an estimated population of 23,507,783, an increase of 579,275 (2.5%) from the prior year and an increase of 2,655,993 (12.7%) since the year 2000. Texas has seen an increase in population in all three subcategories&mdash;natural (births less deaths), net immigration, and net migration. The natural increase since the last census was 1,389,275 people (2,351,909 births minus 962,634 deaths), immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 801,576 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 451,910 people. The state passed New York in the 1990s to become the second-largest U.S. state in population. As of 2004, the state has 3.5 million foreign-born residents (15.6 percent of the state population), of which an estimated 1.2 million are illegal immigrants (illegal immigrants account for more than one-third of the foreign-born population in Texas and 5.4 percent of the total state population).  As of the 2006 US Census estimates, the racial distribution in Texas are as follows: 54.4% White American, 11.9% African American, 3.4% are Asian American or American Indian, and 35.7% are Hispanics or Latino (of any race).http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html The largest reported ancestry groups in Texas include: Mexican (25.3%), German (10.9%), African American (10.5%),  English (7.2%), and Scots-Irish (7.2%). Descendants from some of these ancestry groups are underreported. Much of east, central, and north Texas is inhabited by white Protestant heritage, primarily descended from ancestors from Great Britain and Ireland. Much of central and southeast-central Texas is inhabited by whites of German descent. African Americans, who historically made up one-third of the state population, are concentrated in those parts of East Texas where the cotton plantation culture was most prominent prior to the American Civil War, as well as in Dallas and Houston. Several of the smaller European settlements have left their marks on the state. Frontier Texas saw settlements of Germans, particularly in Fredericksburg and New&nbsp;Braunfels. After the European revolutions of 1848, German, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Czech and French immigration grew, and continued until World War I. The influence of the diverse immigrants from Europe survives in the names of towns, styles of architecture, genres of music, and varieties of cuisine. Lavaca County is predominantly Czech. More than one-third of Texas residents are of Hispanic origin and may be of any racial group. Many have recently arrived, while others, Tejanos, have ancestors who have multigenerational ties in Texas. Hispanics dominate south, south-central, and west Texas and are a significant part of the residents in San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas. Immigrants (including illegal aliens)&mdash;primarily from far southern Mexico and Central America also contribute to the state's growth. The influx of immigration is partially responsible for Texas having a population younger than the U.S. average. Recently, the Asian population in Texas has grown&mdash;primarily in Houston and Dallas.  Texas is a part of the strong socially conservative Evangelical Protestant, Bible Belt, and has a higher percentage of people with religious affiliation than any other statehttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A19148-2003Jan20?language=printer. Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas is home to three major evangelical seminaries, Dallas Theological Seminary, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and Criswell College. The city has several of America's largest megachurches including the Potter's House pastored by T.D Jakes. Houston is home to the largest church in the nation, Lakewood Church, which is pastored by Joel Osteen.  Lubbock, Texas has the most churches per capita in the nation.http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A19148-2003Jan20?language=printer In 2000, The religious demographics of Texas were: The largest single denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Catholic Church 4,368,969, the Southern Baptist Convention 3,519,459 and the United Methodist Church 1,022,342.  As of 2000, six incorporated places in Texas had populations greater than 500,000, of which two are global cities: Houston and Dallas.http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html Texas has a total of 25 metropolitan areas, with four having populations over 1 million and two over 5 million. Texas has the most cities in the US, three, with populations exceeding 1 million: Houston, San&nbsp;Antonio, and Dallas; which are also among the 10 largest cities of the United States. Austin and Fort&nbsp;Worth are among the top 20 largest U.S. cities.List of United States cities by population     The Texas Constitution&mdash;adopted in 1876&mdash;is the second-oldest state constitution still in effect. As with many state constitutions, it explicitly provides for the separation of powers and incorporates its bill of rights directly into the text of the constitution (as Article I). The bill of rights is considerably lengthier and more detailed than the federal Bill of Rights, and includes provisions unique to Texas.  The executive branch consists of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner, Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the Secretary of State. All of these positions are elected by the populace, with the exception of the Secretary of State, who is appointed by the Governor. The governor, Rick Perry, commands the state militia and can veto bills passed by the Legislature and call special sessions of the Legislature (an exclusive power for the Governor). The Governor also appoints members of various executive boards and fills judicial vacancies between elections. The Comptroller decides if expected state income is sufficient to cover proposed state budgets. The executive branch also consists of state agencies, boards and commissions. . The bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives, with 150 members, and a Senate, with 31 members. The Speaker of the House, currently Tom Craddick leads the House, and the Lieutenant Governor, currently David Dewhurst, leads the Senate. The Legislature meets in regular session only once every two years. The Governor can call a special sessions, as often as desired.  The judicial system of Texas is one of the most complex in the United States, with many layers and many overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the Texas Supreme Court, for civil cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the Governor fills vacancies by appointment.  The justice system in Texas has a strict sentencing for criminals. Texas leads the nation in executions, with 400 executions from 1982 to 2007. Only capital murder is eligible for the death penalty. A bill making the rape of a child a capital crime in some instances is currently under consideration.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/4626812.html Before 2005, the alternate sentence was life with the possibility of parole after 40 calendar years; in 2005, the law was modified to make the alternate sentence life without parole.  Known for their role in Texas law enforcement history, the Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety continue to provide special law enforcement services to the state. Texas Game Wardens&mdash;law enforcement officers working for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department&mdash;are given the same amount of authority as any other law enforcement officer. It is a common myth that they can enter private property without a search warrant and search people or vehicles with no probable cause.  There are 32 congressional districts in Texas, the second-most after California. Texas has a total of 254 counties&mdash;the most of any state. Each county is run by a commissioners’ court consisting of four elected commissioners and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. County government is similar to the "weak" mayor-council system; the county judge has no veto authority, but votes along with the other commissioners. All county elections are partisan. Unlike other states, Texas does not allow for consolidated city-county governments, nor does it have a form of metropolitan government. Cities and counties are permitted to enter "interlocal agreements" to share services. Further, counties are not granted "home rule" status; their powers are strictly defined by state law and the Texas Constitution. Texas does not have townships&mdash; areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated. Incorporated areas are part of a municipality either as a town or a city, though it may contract with the county for needed services. Unincorporated areas are not part of a municipality; in these areas, the county has authority for law enforcement and road maintenance. Municipalities are classified as either "general law" or "home rule". A municipality may elect home rule status (draft an independent charter) once it exceeds 5,000 population and the voters agree to home rule. Otherwise, it is classified as general law and has very limited powers. All municipal elections in Texas are nonpartisan. Once a municipality elects home rule status, it keeps that status even if the population later falls below 5,000.    The Democratic Party held a monolithic political presence in Texas from the beginning of its statehood until the late 20th century. Like many "Solid South" states, Texas harbored a deep resentment towards the Republican Party for the Radical Reconstruction after the American Civil War. Conservative Democrats however, endorsed many Republican presidential candidates because they perceived a liberal shift in their national party. When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he reportedly said "We have lost the South." In 1978, the state elected its first post-reconstruction Republican governor, and in 2003, Republicans, for the first time, gained control of the state legislature. Today, Republicans control most of Texas's House delegation, and both U.S. Senators. Of the 32 congressional districts in Texas, 19 seats are held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats.  The Republicans that represent Texas in the U.S. Senate are Kay Bailey Hutchison (since 1993) and John Cornyn (since 2003). Since 1994 Texans have not elected a Democrat to a statewide office. The remains of the state's Democratic presence is primarily comprised of minority groups and urban voters, particularly in Austin. Democrats and independents still hold many positions in city governments. The Texas political atmosphere leans towards fiscal and social conservatism. Since 1980 Texas supported Republican Presidential candidates. In 2000 and 2004 Republican George W. Bush won Texas with 60.1% of the vote. This is in part due to his popularity as a recent Governor of that state. Austin is considered the state's most liberal city or "populist" bastion, and Houston is among the few urban areas that consistently vote Republican, but their metropolitan areas are very divided politically. Dallas remains approximately split. In the southwest part of the state, particularly in El Paso, Democrats are strong.  In 2006, Texas had a gross state product of $1.09 trillion,http://www.cpa.state.tx.us/ecodata/ecoind/ecoind5.html#product the second highest in the U.S.http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/gspnewsrelease.htm Gross state product per capita as of 2005 was $42,975. Texas leads the nation in number of cattle, which usually exceed 16 million head. Cotton is the leading crop and the state's second-most-valuable farm product. Texas also leads nationally in production of grain sorghum, watermelons, cabbages, and spinach. Wheat, corn, and other grains are also important. Texas's economy is known for its energy and aeronautics industries, and for the ship channel at the Port of Houston&mdash;the largest in the U.S. in international commerce and the sixth-largest port in the world.As Enron Trial Begins, Houston Has Moved On. Newhouse News Service  The state is home to the most Fortune 500 companies and has the second-largest economy in the United States.List of U.S. states by GDP (nominal) The Texas Medical Center in Houston contains the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions.  Texas's growth can be attributed to the availability of jobs, the low cost of housing, the lack of a personal state income tax, high quality of education, low taxation and limited regulation of business, a central geographic location, a limited government, favorable weather, and plentiful supplies of oil and natural gas. The known petroleum deposits of Texas are about 8 billion barrels, which makes up approximately one-third of the known U. S. supply. Texas has 4.6 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves. There are currently 33 billionaires residing in Texas today. Dallas has 11 billionaires, the most of any city in Texas. Texas remained largely rural until World War II, with cattle ranching, oil, and agriculture as its main industries. The sprawling 320,000 deeded acre (1,200 km²) La Escalera Ranch, located  south of Fort Stockton, Texas, is one of the largest cattle ranches in the Southwestern United States.   Cattle ranching was never Texas's chief industry &ndash; before the oil boom back to the period of the first Anglo settlers, the chief industry was cotton farming. After World War II, Texas became increasingly industrialized. Its economy today relies largely on information technology, oil and natural gas, fuel processing, electric power, agriculture, and manufacturing. Much economic activity in Texas is regional&ndash; for example, the timber industry is important in East Texas's economy but a non-factor elsewhere, while Houston, the state's largest urban economic enclave stands at the center of the petrochemical, biomedical research trades, and aerospace (particularly NASA). Meanwhile, Dallas houses the state's predominant defense manufacturing interests and the expansive information technology labor market.   Texas has the second highest number of Fortune 500 company headquarters, fifty-six.http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2007/states/TX.html This has been attributed to both the growth in population in Texas and the rise of oil prices in 2005. In 2006, for the fifth year in a row, Texas led the nation in export revenues. Texas exports for 2006 totaled $150.8 billion, which is $22.1 billion more than 2005 and represents a 17.2 percent increase. In 2002, the Port of Houston was 6th among the top sea ports in the world in terms of total cargo volume; Air Cargo World rated Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport as "the best air cargo airport in the world". Defense is one of the state's largest exports. Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division is located in Fort Worth, Texas. The F-16 Fighting Falcon, the largest Western fighter program is produced in Fort Worth, Texas. Lockheed Martin, Poland Air Force Celebrate Arrival of Most Advanced F-16 Multirole Fighters in Europe The plane's successor, the F-35 Lightning II will also be produced in Fort Worth. Texans pride their state's history, but they also seek new social and technological developments. The Austin area is often nicknamed "Silicon Hills". Dell's headquarters is located in the city's suburb, Round Rock. Dallas is the birthplace of the integrated circuit. The North Dallas area is called the "Silicon Prairie" for the area's high concentration of Information Technology companies such as Texas Instruments and EDS. In addition, Houston based Compaq, was once the world's largest computer companies. After Compaq's merger with Hewlett-Packard, the new owner currently employs more employees in Houston, than anywhere else in the world. Houston is a global leader in the energy industry. Since 2003, Texas state officials have created various initiatives like the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund to develop the economy of Texas. Texas is a leader in alternative energy sources, producing the most wind power of any state, as well as small solar powered efforts and the experimental installation of wave-powered generators.  Texas has a large tourism industry. The state tourism slogan is "Texas: It's like a whole other country", a nod to Texas's diversity and history. Tourists might enjoy San Antonio and El Paso's hispanic culture, or Fort Worth western attractions. Corpus Christi  and Padre Island are some of the popular Texas resort areas located on the Gulf of Mexico. Texas is a top filmmaking state. Austin is now one of the leading filmmaking locations in the country. The popular soap opera's, Dallas, exteriors were filmed on Southfork Ranch, a location near Plano, Texas. During 1995-2004, more than $2.75 billion has been spent in Texas for film and television production. The Texas Film Commission was founded for free services to filmmakers, from location research to traveling. Also many Hollywood studios are relocating parts of their production divisions to the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex.   In addition to Texas's traditional culture, immigration has caused Texas to become a melting pot of different cultures around the world. Texas's diverse and international culture is partly due to its academic institutions and strong biomedical, energy, manufacturing and aerospace industries. The rodeo is a large part of the Texas culture. The annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest rodeo in the world. The event begins with trail rides that originate from several points throughout the state, all of which convene at Reliant Park. The World’s first rodeo was held in Pecos, Texas on 4 July 1883. The Southwestern Livestock Show and Rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas has many traditional rodeos, but also a cowboy rodeo, and a Mexican rodeo. The State Fair of Texas is held in Dallas, Texas each year at Fair Park. Austin, Texas, the The&nbsp;Live&nbsp;Music&nbsp;Capital&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;World,  boasts the most venues per capita of any U.S. city. The city's music revolves around the nightclubs on 6th Street and an annual film, music, and multimedia festival known as South by Southwest. The longest-running concert music program on American television, Austin City Limits, is filmed on The University of Texas at Austin campus or in Zilker Park. Austin City Limits and Waterloo Records run the Austin City Limits Music Festival, an annual music and art festival held at Zilker Park. Over the past couple of decades, San Antonio evolved into the "Nashville of Tejano music." The Tejano Music Awards have provided a forum to create greater awareness and appreciation for Tejano music and culture.  Known for the vibrancy of its visual and performing arts, the Houston Theatre District&mdash;a 17-block area in the heart of Downtown Houston&mdash;is ranked second in the country in the number of theatre seats in a concentrated downtown area with 12,948 seats for live performances and 1,480 movie seats.http://www.houstontheaterdistrict.org/en/cms/?68 Houston is also one of only five American cities with permanent professional resident companies in all of the major performing arts disciplines (the Houston Grand Opera, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Ballet, and The Alley Theatre).http://www.visithoustontexas.com/arts_and_culture.asp?pageid=232 Fort Worth and Dallas serve as epicenters of the North Texas region's art scene. The Modern (formerly the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth), founded in 1892, is the oldest art museum in Texas. The city is also home to the Kimbell Art Museum, the Amon Carter Museum, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, the Will Rogers Memorial Center, and the Bass Performance Hall downtown. The Arts District of Downtown Dallas is home to several arts venues. Notable venues in the district include the Dallas Museum of Art, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, The Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art, and the Nasher Sculpture Center. Also within Dallas is the notable Deep Ellum district which originally became popular during the 1920s and 1930s as the prime jazz and blues hotspot in the Southern United States. The name Deep Ellum is thought to have originally derived from local tongues saying "Deep Elm", but that came out as "Deep Ellum". Artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson, Robert Johnson, Huddie "Leadbelly" Ledbetter, and Bessie Smith played in original Deep Ellum clubs like The Harlem and The Palace. Today, Deep Ellum is home to hundreds of artists who live in lofts and operate in studios throughout the district alongside bars, pubs, and concert venues. One major art infusion in the area is the city's lax stance on graffiti, thusly several public ways including tunnels, sides of buildings, sidewalks, and streets are covered in murals.  Many Texans are passionate about American football and intensely follow high school and college football teams&mdash;often they dominate social and leisure activity. Texas is home to two NFL teams, the Houston Texans and the Dallas Cowboys, sometimes referred to as "America's Team". Baseball has a strong presence in Texas, with Major League Baseball teams the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros. Minor league baseball is also closely followed in Texas&mdash;especially in the smaller metropolitan areas. The Fort Worth Cats are a team in Fort Worth, Texas that has won 3 straight championships, one in the Central Baseball League and the last two in the American Association. Basketball is also popular, and Texas hosts three NBA teams: the Houston Rockets, the San Antonio Spurs, and the Dallas Mavericks. All three have reached the NBA Finals and the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs have won championships. Additionally, Texas is home to two WNBA teams, the Houston Comets and the San Antonio Silver Stars. The Comets were the winners of the first four WNBA Championships in league history, in the 1997&ndash;2000 seasons.  However, the lost a start player to free agency in March of 2008.  Many Texas universities have rich athletic traditions. Originally, most Texas Division I universities were part of the Southwest Conference until it dissolved in 1996. Four of the largest programs in Texas are now part of the Big 12 Conference: the Baylor Bears, Texas A&M Aggies, Texas Longhorns, and Texas Tech Red Raiders. In addition to the four Big 12 schools, Texas is home to six other Division I (Bowl Sub-Division) teams: the TCU Horned Frogs of the Mountain West Conference; the SMU Mustangs, the Houston Cougars, the Rice Owls and the UTEP Miners, all of Conference USA; and the North Texas Mean Green of the Sun Belt Conference. Texas has the most Division I-FBS schools in America, ten. Hockey has been a growing participatory sport in the Dallas/Fort Worth area since the Minnesota North Stars became the Dallas Stars in 1993. Minor league professional hockey has become popular in the last few decades; such as the Houston Skippers USHL Louden Cup winners in 1948 with legendary coach Toe Blake. AHL Houston Aeros who won the IHL's Turner Cup in 1999 and the AHL Calder Cup in 2003 and two Avco Cups in the WHA. The San Antonio Rampage also play in the AHL, and a third AHL team, the Texas Stars, will begin play in Cedar Park, Texas in 2009 or 2010. Texas is home to seven of the Central Hockey League's seventeen teams. Other popular sports in Texas include year-round golf, fishing, and auto racing. Lacrosse, originally played by some of the indigenous tribes, is growing in popularity. Soccer is a popular participatory sport, especially among children, but as a spectator sport it does not yet have a large following despite two Texan teams in Major League Soccer and the back to back 2006 and 2007 MLS Cup winners Houston Dynamo in MLS. In addition to Texas's traditional architecture the state also has noteworthy contemporary buildings. Many world class architects and Pritzker Prize winners have left their enriching marks on Texan cities and landscapes. Frank Lloyd Wright had four buildings in Texas,http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/1469/flw_tx.html while Tadao Ando's Modern Art Museum and Louis Kahn's famous Kimbell Art Museum are permanent landmarks of the city of Fort Worth. Other super architects such as I.M. Pei and Philip Johnson have numerous works across the state. Among their famous works one can mention the Fort Worth Water Gardens, Amon Carter Museum, Chapel of St. Basil, Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, and Thanks-Giving Square. In Austin, Gordon Bunshaft's Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum (also a Pritzker Prize winner) is particularly noteworthy, while Steven Holl, Robert A. M. Stern, Richard Meier, and César Pelli are other architect legends who designed buildings that grace the Dallas and Houston areas. Sir Norman Foster's Dallas Center for the Performing Arts is the latest addition to such architectural landmarks in Texas. Some facilities even harbor the marks of multiple architects. Houston's Museum of Fine Arts for example, was designed by Pritzker Prize winner Rafael Moneo, landscape architect extraordinnaire Isamu Noguchi, and the pioneering master of Modern Architecture Mies van der Rohe.  Ricardo Legorreta's San Antonio Public Library is an excellent example of postmodern architecture in Texas. The Bexar County Courthouse by James Riely Gordon is a work of Romanesque Revival architecture  from 1892. Philip Johnson's landscaping masterpiece: the Fort Worth Water Gardens. Nicholas J. Clayton's "Old Red" built in 1891, is on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and is a registered Texas historic landmark. Texas is also home to some of the tallest skyscrapers in the United States. The Houston skyline has been ranked fourth-most impressive in the United States when ranked by breadth and height,The World's Best SkylinesEgbert Gramsbergen and Paul Kazmierczak, 2006 being the country's third-tallest skyline and one of the top 10 in the world;Calculated Average Height of the Ten Tallest (CAHTT)UltrapolisProject.comTallest Cities of the World?SkyscraperPage Forum, August 30, 2006 however, because it is spread over a few miles, most pictures of the city show only the main downtown area. Houston has a system of tunnels and skywalks linking buildings in downtown. The tunnel system also includes shops, restaurants, and convenience stores. Images shown below are the eight tallest buildings in Texas.  Image:Chase_Tower,_a_block_away.jpg|1. JPMorgan Chase TowerHouston Image:Wells Fargo Bank Plaza, Houston, from base.jpg|2.

Heritage PlazaHouston   The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT, pronounced "tex-dot") is a governmental agency that "provide[s] safe, effective, and efficient movement of people and goods" throughout the state. Though the public face of the agency is generally associated with maintenance of the state's immense highway system, the agency is also responsible for aviation in the state and overseeing public transportation systems.   Texas freeways have been heavily traveled since the 1948 opening of the Gulf Freeway in Houston, and they are often under construction to meet the demands of continuing growth. As of 2005, there were  of public highway in Texas (up from 71,000 in 1984). Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) planners have sought ways to reduce rush hour congestion, primarily through high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes for vans and carpools. The "Texas T"&mdash;an innovation originally introduced in Houston&mdash;is a ramp design that allows vehicles in the HOV lane, which is usually the center lane, to exit directly to transit centers or to enter the freeway directly into the HOV lane without crossing multiple lanes of traffic. Timed freeway entrances, which regulate the addition of cars to the freeway, are also common. Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, and El Paso have extensive networks of freeway cameras linked to transit control centers to monitor and study traffic. One characteristic of Texas's freeways is the frontage road, found even in the most remote areas. Frontage roads provide access to the freeway from businesses alongside, such as gas stations and retail stores. Alongside most freeways, together with the frontage roads are two to four lanes in each direction parallel to the freeway permitting easy access to individual city streets. New landscaping projects and a longstanding ban on new billboards are ways Houston has tried to control the potential side effects of this convenience road. Another common characteristic found near Texas overpasses are the Texas U-turns which is a lane allowing cars traveling on one side of a one-way frontage road to U-turn into the opposite frontage road (typically crossing over or under a freeway or expressway) without being stopped by traffic lights or crossing the highway traffic at-grade. In the western part of the state, both I-10 and I-20 have a speed limit of 80 MPH, the highest in the nation.  The Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, located nearly equidistant from downtown Dallas and downtown Fort Worth, is the largest airport in the state, the second largest in the United States, and fourth largest in the world. In terms of traffic, DFW is the busiest in the state, third busiest in the United States, and sixth busiest in the world.  The airport serves 135 domestic destinations and 40 international.   DFW is the largest and main hub for American Airlines (900 daily departures), the world's largest in terms of total passengers-miles transported[Aviation Week and Space Technology, January 15, 2007, p. 349],  and passenger fleet size.http://www.aviationexplorer.com/american_airlines.htm Texas's second-largest air facility is Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), which is the ninth-busiest in the United States for total passengers, and nineteenth-busiest worldwide. Houston is the headquarters of Continental Airlines, and is the airline's largest hub, with over 750 daily departures (most operated by Continental). A long list of cities within Texas, as well as international destinations are served directly from this airport; with 30 destinations in Mexico, IAH offers service to more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. airport. IAH currently ranks second among U.S. airports with scheduled non-stop domestic and international service (221 destinations), trailing only Atlanta Hartsfield with 250 destinations. Southwest Airlines, the largest domestic carrier in the United States began its operations at Dallas Love Field. and is still headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It is the largest airline in the United States by number of passengers carried domestically per year and the largest airline in the world by number of passengers carried.  Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), the Dallas area public transportation authority, began operating the first light rail system in the Southwest United States in 1996 and continues to expand its coverage. The DART lightrail currently covers  of track. DART currently has three lines (Blue, Green, and Red) with 35 stations in multiple cities including Dallas, Richardson, Plano, and Garland. Current construction will add an additional 46.2 miles of rail with 28 new stations. The DART light rail system remained the only one in Texas until METRORail opened in Houston in 2004. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas (METRO) operates light rail service in Harris County, which includes Houston. METRO's light rail in Houston started on January 1 2004. Currently the track runs about  from Downtown Houston to the Texas Medical Center and Reliant Park. METRO also operates bus service in Harris County and to two cities in Fort Bend County. METRO is in the process of adding over 30 more miles of light rail, as well as  of commuter rail by the year 2015. The Trinity Railway Express (TRE) is a commuter rail service between Fort Worth & Dallas provided by the cooperative service of the Fort Worth Transportation Authority (the T) and Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART).  The TRE links downtown Fort Worth, downtown Dallas, and DFW Airport and as such is the only commuter line in the United States to link two major metropolitan downtown areas and an international airport.  Opening with a 10-mile starter system on December 30, 1996, the TRE system, with a total of nine stations along its route, was completed in December 2001.  Ridership in 2004 was estimated at 2.16 million. Currently, intercity passenger rail service in Texas is limited from both network and frequency viewpoint, with just three Amtrak trains serving the state: the daily Texas Eagle , the tri-weekly Sunset Limited , and the daily Heartland Flyer .  Texas is home to three of the world's elite research medical centers: the renowned Texas Medical Center in Houston, UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and the South Texas Medical Center in San&nbsp;Antonio&mdash;all hosting some of the world's most prestigious schools in the health sciences. Houston is home to the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions. There are 45 member institutions in the Texas Medical CenterFacts and Figures.  Texas Medical Center. 2006. Last Retrieved 2007-03-17. &mdash;all are non-profit organizations, and are dedicated to the highest standards of patient and preventive care, research, education, and local, national, and international community well-being. These institutions include 13 renowned hospitals and two specialty institutions, two medical schools, four nursing schools, and schools of dentistry, public health, pharmacy, and virtually all health-related careers. It is where one of the first, and still the largest, air emergency services was created&mdash;a very successful inter-institutional transplant program was developed&mdash;and the most heart surgeries are performed there in the world. San Antonio's South Texas Medical Center facilities rank sixth in clinical medicine research impact in the United Stateshttp://www.uthscsa.edu/hscnews/singleformat.asp?newID=2353 with the University of Texas Health Science Center recognized as a "world leading research and educational institution".See: [ ] and its teaching hospital: [ ] The South Texas Medical Center hosts no less than 12 hospitals, 45 medical institutions, and 3 universities, housing the nation's top schools in pharmacyUT Austin's School of Pharmacy: Dallas is home to the American Heart Association and the UT Southwestern Medical Center, "among the top academic medical centers in the world".See: http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept37361/files/281435.html The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at the center employs the most Nobel laureates working of any medical school in the world.http://www8.utsouthwestern.edu/vgn/images/portal/cit_56417/43/32/2800592006_Fact_Sheet.pdfhttp://www8.utsouthwestern.edu/home/about/index.html Texas has eight medical schools,http://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=86 three dental schools, and one optometry school, all involved in research and clinical operations. These include the Baylor College of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Texas A&M Health Science Center, and the University of North Texas Health Science Center. The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center is widely considered one of the world’s most productive and highly-regarded academic institutions devoted to cancer patient care, research, education and prevention.According to: [ ] Texas has two Biosafety Level 4 laboratories: one at The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, and the other at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio&mdash;the first privately owned BSL-4 lab in the United States. In May 2006, Texas initiated the program "code red" in response to the report that Texas&mdash;at 25.1 percent&mdash;has the largest un-insured population of the nation.http://www.utsystem.edu/hea/codered/    There are 181 colleges, universities and dozens of other institutions engaged in the research and development of Texas. Most public universities are members of five different systems: University of Houston, University of North Texas, University of Texas, Texas A&M University, Texas State, and Texas Tech. University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, University of Texas at Dallas and University of Houston are Texas's four largest comprehensive doctoral degree-granting institutions with a combined enrollment of over 145,000.   The state also has many private universities. Rice University&mdash;one of the country’s leading teaching and research universities&mdash;ranked the 17th-best university overall in the nation by U.S. News & World Report.America's Best Colleges 2006. U.S. News & World Report Additionally, Baylor University&mdash;the oldest university in the state&mdash;was chartered by the Republic of Texas. The state's public school systems are administered by the Texas Education Agency (TEA). Texas has over 1,000 school districts&mdash;all but one of the school districts in Texas are separate from any form of municipal government. School districts may (and often do) cross city and county boundaries&mdash;an exception to this rule is Stafford Municipal School District. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Texas also has numerous private schools of all types. The TEA has no authority over private school operations; private schools may or may not be accredited, and achievement tests are not required for private school graduating seniors. Many private schools obtain accreditation and perform achievement tests to show parents the school's interest in educational performance. The state has some of the least restrictions on home school. Neither TEA nor the local school district has authority to regulate home school activities. There is no minimum number of days in a year, or hours in a day, that must be met, and achievement tests are not required for home school graduating seniors. The validity of home schooling was challenged in Texas, but a landmark case, Leeper v. Arlington ISD, ruled that home schooling was legal and that the state had little authority to regulate the practice. .      ang:Texas frp:Tèxas ast:Texas zh-min-nan:Texas be-x-old:Тэхас bpy:টেক্সাস pam:Texas lad:Texas lij:Texas nah:Texas pms:Texas scn:Texas simple:Texas sh:Texas diq:Texas bat-smg:Teksasos City !!
