 The Republic of the Congo (; Kongo: Repubilika ya Kongo; Lingala: Republiki ya Kongó), also known as  Congo-Brazzaville or the Congo, is a country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Gabon, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Angolan exclave province of Cabinda, and the Gulf of Guinea. The republic is a former French colony.  Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. After a quarter century of Marxism, Congo completed its transition into a multi-party democracy in 1992. However, a brief civil war in 1997 ended in the restoration of former Marxist President Denis Sassou Nguesso to power.  The earliest inhabitants of the area were Pygmy peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes during Bantu expansions. The Bakongo are Bantu groups that also occupied parts of present-day Angola, Gabon, and Democratic Republic of the Congo, forming the basis for ethnic affinities and rivalries among those states. Several Bantu kingdoms—notably those of the Kongo, the Loango, and the Teke—built trade links leading into the Congo River basin. The first European contacts came in the late 15th century, and commercial relationships were quickly established with the kingdoms—trading for slaves captured in the interior. The coastal area was a major source for the transatlantic slave trade, and when that commerce ended in the early 19th century, the power of the Bantu kingdoms eroded. Following independence as the Congo Republic on August 15 1960, Fulbert Youlou ruled as the country's first president until labor elements and rival political parties instigated a three-day uprising that ousted him. The Congolese military took charge of the country briefly and installed a civilian provisional government headed by Alphonse Massamba-Débat. Under the 1963 constitution, Massamba-Débat was elected President for a five-year term but it was ended abruptly with an August 1968 coup d'état. Capt. Marien Ngouabi, who had participated in the coup, assumed the presidency on December 31, 1968. One year later, President Ngouabi proclaimed Congo to be Africa's first "people's republic" and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary Movement to change its name to the Congolese Labour Party (PCT). On March 16, 1977, President Ngouabi was assassinated. An 11-member Military Committee of the Party (CMP) was named to head an interim government with Col. (later Gen.) Joachim Yhombi-Opango to serve as President of the Republic. After decades of turbulent politics bolstered by Marxist-Leninist rhetoric, and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Congo completed a transition to multi-party democracy with elections in August 1992. Denis Sassou Nguesso conceded defeat and Congo's new president, Prof. Pascal Lissouba, was inaugurated on August 31, 1992. However, Congo's democratic progress was derailed in 1997. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou camps mounted. On June 5, President Lissouba's government forces surrounded Sassou's compound in Brazzaville and Sassou ordered members of his private militia (known as "Cobras") to resist. Thus began a four-month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville and caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths. In early October, Angolan troops invaded Congo on the side of Sassou and, in mid-October, the Lissouba government fell. Soon thereafter, Sassou declared himself President. The Congo Civil War continued for another year and a half until a peace deal was struck between the various factions in December 1999. Sham elections in 2002 saw Sassou win with almost 10% of the vote cast. His two main rivals Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival, Andre Milongo, advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race. A new constitution, agreed upon by referendum in January 2002, granted the president new powers and also extended his term to seven years as well as introducing a new bicameral assembly. International observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election as well as the constitutional referendum, both of which were reminiscent in their organization of Congo's era of the single-party state.   The most important of the many political parties are the Democratic and Patriotic Forces or FDP [Denis Sassou Nguesso, president], an alliance consisting of: Other significant parties include: The Republic of the Congo is divided into 10 régions (regions) and one commune, the capital Brazzaville. These are:  The regions are subdivided into forty-six districts.   Congo is located in the central-western part of sub-Saharan Africa, along the Equator. To the south and east of it is the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is also bounded by Gabon to the west, Cameroon and the Central African Republic to the north, and Cabinda (Angola) to the southwest. It has a short Atlantic coast. The capital, Brazzaville, is located on the Congo River, in the south of the country, immediately across from Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The southwest of the country is a coastal plain for which the primary drainage is the Kouilou-Niari River; the interior of the country consists of a central plateau between two basins to the south and north.  The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on petroleum, support services, and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Petroleum extraction has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. The government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its petroleum earnings, contributing to a shortage of revenues. The January 12, 1994 devaluation of Franc Zone currencies by 50% resulted in inflation of 61% in 1994, but inflation has subsided since. Economic reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. The reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. When Sassou Nguesso returned to power at the war ended in October 1997, he publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions. However, economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998, which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic problems of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty, despite record-high oil prices since 2003. Natural gas and diamonds are also recent major Congolese exports, although Congo was excluded from the Kimberley Process in 2004 amid allegations that most of its diamond exports were in fact being smuggled out of the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.   The Republic of the Congo's sparse population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country, leaving the vast areas of tropical jungle in the north virtually uninhabited. Thus, Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in Africa, with 85% of its total population living in a few urban areas, namely in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, or one of the small cities or villages lining the  railway which connects the two cities. In rural areas, industrial and commercial activity has declined rapidly in recent years, leaving rural economies dependent on the government for support and subsistence. Before the 1997 war, about 15,000 Europeans and other non-Africans lived in Congo, most of whom were French. Presently, only about 9,500 remain.   Since the country is located on the Equator, the climate is consistent year-round, with the average day temperature being a humid  () and nights generally between  ().      crh:Kongo (Brazzavil) frp:Rèpublica du Congô ast:Congo zh-min-nan:Congo Kiōng-hô-kok be-x-old:Рэспубліка Конга bpy:কঙ্গো প্রজাতন্ত্র pam:Republic of the Congo lij:Repubbrica Do Congo nov:Kongo pms:Còngo scn:Concu simple:Republic of the Congo sh:Republika Kongo vec:Republica del Congo diq:Kongo bat-smg:Kuongs Convention for Alternative Democracy Congolese Labour Party (PCT) Liberal Republican Party National Union for Democracy and Progress Patriotic Union for the National Reconstruction National Republic Party of Helasia Union for the National Renewal Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development or MCDDI [Michel Mampouya] Pan-African Union for Social Development or UPADS [Martin Mberi] Rally for Democracy and Social Progress or RDPS [Jean-Pierre Thystere Tchicaya, president] Rally for Democracy and the Republic or RDR [Raymond Damasge Ngollo] Union for Democracy and Republic or UDR leader NA Union of Democratic Forces or UFD, Sebastian Ebao List of writers from the Republic of the Congo Music of the Republic of the Congo Public holidays in the Republic of the Congo Communications in the Republic of the Congo Foreign relations of the Republic of the Congo Military of the Republic of the Congo Transport in the Republic of the Congo Scouting in Congo-Brazzaville List of cities in the Republic of the Congo List of Democratic Republic of the Congo-related topics List of Republic of the Congo-related topics Maria Petringa, Brazza, A Life for Africa  (2006)  ISBN 9781-4259-11980 AllAfrica.com - Congo-Brazzaville news headline links IRIN News for Congo, from the United Nations CIA World Factbook - Congo, Republic of the Congolese literature at a glance Open Directory Project - Republic of the Congo directory category Stanford University - Africa South of the Sahara: Congo-Brazzaville directory category The Index on Africa - Congo-Brazzaville directory category University of Pennsylvania - African Studies Center: Congo directory category Yahoo! - Congo (Brazzaville) directory category Baka Pygmies of Cameroon and Congo Culture and music of the first inhabitants of Congo [ ] Amnesty International Human Rights Report, 2006  :LINKNUM:114
