   Addis Ababa (sometimes spelled Addis Abeba, the spelling used by the official Ethiopian Mapping Authority; Amharic, Āddīs Ābebā "new flower," ; Oromo Finfinne) is the capital city of Ethiopia and the African Union and its predecessor, the OAU. With a Population of 3,627,934 as of 2007, Addis Ababa is the world's largest city that is in a landlocked country. As a chartered city (ras gez astedader), Addis Ababa has the status of both a city and a state. The city has as many as 80 nationalities speaking 80 languages, and Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities.  Addis Ababa is a grassland biome. The city is located at .[ ] From its lowest point, around Bole International Airport, at  above sea level in the southern periphery, the city rises to over  in the Entoto Mountains to the north. The site was chosen by Empress Taytu Betul and the city was founded in 1886 by her husband, Emperor Menelik II, and now has a population of around four million, and an eight per cent annual growth rate. The city lies at the foot of Mount Entoto, and is home to Addis Ababa University.  Addis Ababa was founded by the Ethiopian emperor Menelik II. Other parts of the city were called Fil wiha ("hot springs") in Amharic. Menelik, as initially a King of the Shewa province, had found Mount Entoto a useful base for military operations in the south of his realm, and in 1879 visited the reputed ruins of a medieval town, and an unfinished rock church that showed proof of an Ethiopian presence in the area prior to the campaigns of Ahmad Gragn. His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area. However the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town due to the lack of firewood and water, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in 1886.  Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the "Filwoha" hot mineral springs, where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths.  Other nobility and their staffs and households settled the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the Imperial Palace which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today.  Addis Ababa became Ethiopia's capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that is still visible today is the planting of numerous eucalyptus trees along the city streets. On 5 May, 1936, Italian troops occupied Addis Ababa during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, making it the capital of Italian East Africa from 1936 to 1941. After the Italian army in Ethiopia was defeated by the British army and the Ethiopian patriots) during the East African Campaign, Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa on 5 May, 1941&mdash;five years to the very day after he had departed&mdash;and immediately began the work of re-establishing his capital. Emperor Haile Selassie helped form the Organization of African Unity in 1963, and invited the new organization to keep its headquarters in the city. The OAU was dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the African Union (AU), also headquartered in Addis Ababa.  The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa.  Addis Ababa was also the site of the Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in 1965. Ethiopia has often been called the origin of human kind due to various hominid fossil discoveries like the Australopithecine Lucy. North eastern Ethiopia, and the Afar region in particular was the central focus of these claims until recent DNA evidence suggested origins in south central Ethiopian regions like present-day Addis Ababa.Humans Moved From Africa Across Globe, DNA Study SaysDNA Links Humanity To One Common Origin: Africa After analyzing the DNA of almost 1,000 people around the world, geneticists and other scientists claimed humans spread from what is now Addis Ababa 100,000 years ago.
