    Freetown, population 1,070,200 in a recent estimate, but 772,873 in the 2004 census, is the  capital and largest city of Sierra Leone, and a major port on the Atlantic Ocean. Located in the Western Area of the country on the Sierra Leone peninsula, Freetown is the hub of the nation's administrative, financial, educational, communications, cultural and economic center, as well as its main port.   The area, said to have previously been a slave market, was first settled in 1787 by 400 freed slaves and Black American Loyalists sent from England, under the auspices of British abolitionists. They established the 'Province of Freetown' on land purchased from local Koya Temne subchief King Tom and regent Naimbana, a purchase which was to cede the land to the new settlers "for ever." The established arrangement between Europeans and the Koya Temne did not include provisions for permanent settlement, and some historians question how well the Koya leaders understood the agreement.  Disputes soon broke out, and King Tom's successor, King Jimmy burnt the settlement to the ground in 1789Shaw, Rosalind, Memories of the Slave Trade: Ritual and the Historical Imagination in Sierra Leone.

The London based Sierra Leone Company made a second attempt in 1792 and resettled Freetown with 1,100 former slaves and Loyalists from Nova Scotia, many of whom were born in the colonial United States, led by former slave Thomas Peters. Around 500 free Jamaican Maroons joined them in 1800.  It survived being pillaged by the French in 1794, and the indigenous inhabitants revolted in 1800, but the British retook control, beginning the expansionism that led to the creation of Sierra Leone.  From 1808 to 1874, the city served as the capital of British West Africa.  It also served as the base for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron which was charged with halting the slave trade. Most of the slaves liberated by the squadron choose to settle in Sierra Leone, and Freetown in particular, rather than return home; thus the population includes descendants of many different peoples from all over the west coast of Africa. The city expanded rapidly as many freed slaves settled, accompanied by African soldiers who had fought for Britain in the Napoleonic Wars. During World War II, Britain maintained a naval base at Freetown. Descendants of the freed slaves, called Krios, play a leading role in the city, even though they are a minority of the population. The city was the scene of fierce fighting in the late 1990s. It was captured by ECOWAS troops seeking to restore President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in 1998, and later it was unsuccessfully attacked by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front.

The beginning and end of the rainy season is marked by strong thunder storms.  This is a Tropical Savanna Climate.

Average temperature ranges in Freetown are from 21 degrees Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) to 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) all year. Freetown is governed with a  city council form of government, which is headed by a mayor, in whom executive authority is vested. The mayor is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws are enforced. The mayor is elected directly by the residents of Freetown. The current mayor is Herbert George-Williams, a member of the rulling All Peoples Congress (APC) party. He replaced his fellow member of the Krio  ethnic group, Winstanley Bankole Johnson on January 17, 2008. Johnson was appointed mayor in July 2004 and was a member of the APC. Johnson came to power as the APC swept 2004 Western Area municipal elections.
