   Goa  (Konkani: गोंय goṃya;  govā; ) is India's smallest state in terms of area and the fourth smallest in terms of population. Located on the west coast of India in the region known as the Konkan, it is bounded by the state of Maharashtra to the north, and by Karnataka to the east and south, while the Arabian Sea forms its western coast. Panaji (Panjim) is the state's capital. Vasco da Gama (Vasco) is the largest city. The historic city of Margao still exhibits the influence of Portuguese culture. Portuguese merchants first landed in Goa in the early 16th century, and annexed it soon after. The Portuguese colony existed for about 450 years (one of the longest held colonial possessions in the world), until it was taken over by India in 1961.  Renowned for its beaches, Goa is visited by hundreds of thousands of international and domestic tourists each year. Goa is also known for its temples and world heritage architecture including the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Old Goa, which makes it one of the biggest Christian pilgrimage sites in Asia. Goa also has rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the Western Ghats range, which is classified as a biodiversity hotspot. The name Goa came to European languages from the Portuguese colonisers, but its precise origin is unclear. The name Goa is said to have been derived from the Konkani word 'Goyan', which means a patch of tall grass. The Indian epic Mahabharata refers to the area now known as Goa, as 'Goparashtra' or 'Govarashtra"' which means a nation of cowherds. 'Gopakapuri' or 'Gopakapattanam' were used in some ancient Sanskrit texts, and these names were also mentioned in other sacred Hindu texts such as the Harivansa and the Skanda Purana. In the latter, Goa is also known as "Gomanchala". Gove, Govapuri, Gopakpattan, Gomantak and Gomant are some other names that the region is referred to in certain inscriptions and texts such as the Puranas. It has also been known as "Apparent".   Goa's known history stretches back to the 3rd century BC, when it formed part of the Mauryan Empire. It was later ruled by the Satavahanas of Kolhapur, around two thousand years ago and passed on to the Hoysalas of SInd, who controlled it between 580 to 750. Over the next few centuries Goa was successively ruled by the Silharas, the Kadambas and the Chalukyas of Kalyani, rulers of Deccan India. The Kadambas, a local Hindu dynasty based at Chandrapura, (present day Chandor - Salcete), laid an indelible mark on the course of Goa's pre-colonial history and culture. In 1312, Goa came under the governance of the Delhi Sultanate. However, the kingdom's grip on the region was weak, and by 1370 they were forced to surrender it to Harihara I of the Vijayanagara empire. The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory until 1469, when it was appropriated by the Bahmani sultans of Gulbarga. After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell to the hands of the Adil Shahis of Bijapur who made Velha Goa their auxiliary capital. In 1498, Vasco da Gama became the first European to set foot in India through a sea route, landing in Calicut (Kozhikode) in Kerala, followed by an arrival in what is now known as Old Goa. Goa, then a term referring to the City of Goa on the southern bank of the River Mandovi, was the largest trading centre on India's western coast. The Portuguese arrived with the intention of setting up a colony and seizing control of the spice trade from other European powers after traditional land routes to India had been closed by the Ottoman Turks. Later, in 1510, Portuguese admiral Afonso de Albuquerque defeated the ruling Bijapur kings with the help of a local ally, Timayya, leading to the establishment of a permanent settlement in Velha Goa (or Old Goa). The Portuguese intended it to be a colony and a naval base, distinct from the fortified enclaves established elsewhere along India's coasts.  In 1668, Chatrapti Shivaji captured five towns in North Goa and ordered renovation of "Saptkotishwar" temple at the present site during one of his campaigns to oust the Portuguese. Even after repetitive attempts, he was not able to win the Goa from Portuguese.[20]In 1685, Chatrapti Sambhaji captured capital Panji and penetrated his Maratha army peacefully in entire Central and North Goa but could not retain the Goa and again moved to Deccan plateau to handle  the situation arise due to sudden attack of Mogul.   With the imposition of the Inquisition (1560&ndash;1812), many of the local residents were forcibly converted to Christianity by missionaries, threatened by punishment or confiscation of land, titles or property.   Many converts however retained parts of their Hindu heritage. To escape the Inquisition and harassment, thousands fled the state, settling down in the neighbouring towns of Mangalore and Karwar in Karnataka, and Savantwadi in Maharashtra. With the arrival of the other European powers in India in the 16th century, most Portuguese possessions were surrounded by the British and the Dutch. Goa soon became Portugal's most important possession in India, and was granted the same civic privileges as Lisbon. In 1843 the capital was moved to Panjim from Velha Goa. By mid-18th century the area under occupation had expanded to most of Goa's present day state limits. After India gained independence from the British in 1947, Portugal refused to accede to India's demand to relinquish their control of its enclave. Resolution 1541 by the United Nations General Assembly in 1960 noted that Goa was non-self-governing and favoured self determination. Finally, on December 12, 1961, the Indian army with 40,000 troops moved in as part of Operation Vijay. Fighting lasted for twenty-six hours before the Portuguese garrison surrendered. Goa, along with Daman and Diu (enclaves lying to the north of Maharashtra), was made into a centrally administered Union Territory on India. India's takeover of Goa is commemorated on December 19 (Liberation Day). The UN Security Council considered a resolution condemning the invasion which was vetoed by the Soviet Union. Most nations later recognised India's action, and Portugal recognised it after the Carnation Revolution in 1974. On May 30, 1987, the Union Territory was split, and Goa was elevated as India's twenty-fifth state, with Daman and Diu remaining Union Territories.     Goa encompasses an area of 3,702&nbsp;km² (1,430&nbsp;sq mile). It lies between the latitudes 14°53'54" N and 15°40'00" N and longitudes 73°40'33" E and 74°20'13" E. Most of Goa is a part of the coastal country known as the Konkan, which is an escarpment rising up to the Western Ghats range of mountains, which separate it from the Deccan Plateau. The highest point is the Sonsogor, with an altitude of 1,167&nbsp;meters (3,827&nbsp;feet). Goa has a coastline of 101&nbsp;km (63&nbsp;miles). Goa's main rivers are the Mandovi, the Zuari, the Terekhol, Chapora River and the Betul. The Mormugao harbor on the mouth of the river Zuari is one of the best natural harbors in South Asia. The Zuari and the Mandovi are the lifelines of Goa, with their tributaries draining 69% of its geographic area. Goa has more than forty estuarine, eight marine and about ninety riverine islands. The total navigable length of Goa's rivers is 253&nbsp;km (157&nbsp;miles). Goa has more than three hundred ancient tanks built during the rule of the Kadamba dynasty and over a hundred medicinal springs. Most of Goa's soil cover is made up of laterites which are rich in ferric aluminium oxides and reddish in color. Further inland and along the river banks, the soil is mostly alluvial and loamy. The soil is rich in minerals and humus, thus conducive to plantation. Some of the oldest rocks in the Indian subcontinent are found in Goa between Molem and Anmod on Goa's border with Karnataka. The rocks are classified as Trondjemeitic Gneiss estimated to be 3,600 million years old, dated by the Rubidium isotope dating method. A specimen of the rock is exhibited in the Goa University. Goa, being in the tropical zone and near the Arabian Sea, has a warm and humid climate for most of the year. The month of May is the hottest, seeing day temperatures of over 35 °C (95 °F) coupled with high humidity. The monsoon rains arrive by early June and provide a much needed respite from the heat. Most of Goa's annual rainfall is received through the monsoons which last till late September. Goa has a short cool season between mid-December and February. These months are marked by cool nights of around 20&nbsp;°C (68&nbsp;°F) and warm days of around 29&nbsp;°C (84&nbsp;°F) with moderate amounts of humidity. Further inland, due to altitudinal gradation, the nights are a few degrees cooler.  The state is divided into two districts: North Goa and South Goa. Panaji is the headquarters of the north Goa district and Margao of the south district. Each district is governed by a district collector, an administrator appointed by the Indian government. The districts are further divided into eleven talukas &ndash; Talukas of North Goa are Bardez, Bicholim, Pernem, Ponda, Satari and Tiswadi, the talukas of South Goa are Canacona, Mormugao, Quepem, Salcete and Sanguem. Headquarters of the respective talukas are Mapusa, Bicholim, Pernem, Ponda, Valpoi, Panjim, Chaudi, Vasco, Quepem, Margao and Sanguem. In the Parliament of India, Goa has two seats in the Lok Sabha, one representing each district, and one seat in the Rajya Sabha.   Forest cover in Goa stands at 1,424&nbsp;km², most of which is owned by the government. Government owned forest is estimated at 1224.38&nbsp;km² whilst private is given as 200&nbsp;km². Most of the forests in the state are located in the interior eastern regions of the state. The Western Ghats, which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. In the February 1999 issue of National Geographic Magazine, Goa was compared with the Amazon and Congo basins for its rich tropical biodiversity. Goa's state animal is the Gaur, the state bird is the Ruby Throated Yellow Bulbul, which is a variation of Black-crested Bulbul, and the state tree is the Asan. The important forests products are bamboo canes, Maratha barks, chillar barks and the bhirand. Coconut trees are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of Goa barring the elevated regions. A large number of deciduous vegetation consisting of teak, sal, cashew and mango trees are present. Fruits include jackfruits, mangos, pineapples and blackberries. Foxes, wild boars and migratory birds are found in the jungles of Goa. The avifauna includes kingfishers, mynas and parrots. Numerous types of fish are also caught off the coast of Goa and in its rivers. Crabs, lobsters, shrimps, jellyfish, oysters and catfish form some of the piscine catch. Goa also has a high snake population, which keeps the rodent population in control. Goa has many famous National Parks, including the renowned Salim Ali bird sanctuary. Other wildlife sanctuaries include the Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary, Molem Wildlife Sanctuary, Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, Madei Wildlife Sanctuary, Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuaryand the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary located on the island of Chorao. Goa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38&nbsp;km²) of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Park. Since there is a substantial area under private forests and a large tract under cashew, mango, coconut, etc. plantations, the total forest and tree cover constitutes 56.6% of the geographic area.  Goa's gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $3 billion in current prices. Goa is India's richest state with a GDP per capita two and a half times that of the country as a whole, and one of its fastest growth rates: 8.23% (yearly average 1990–2000). Tourism is Goa's primary industry: it handles 12%Economy of Goa, from goenkar.com verified 2005-04-02. of all foreign tourist arrivals in India. Goa has two main tourist seasons: winter and summer. In the winter time, tourists from abroad (mainly Europe) come to Goa to enjoy the splendid climate. In the summertime (which, in Goa, is the rainy season), tourists from across India come to spend the holidays.  Tourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. In 2004 there were more than 2 million tourists reported to have visited Goa, 400,000 of which were from abroad. The land away from the coast is rich in minerals and ores and mining forms the second largest industry. Mining in Goa focuses on ores of iron, Bauxite, manganese, clays, limestone and silica. The Marmagao Port handled 31.69 million tonnes of cargo last year, and accounts for over 39% of India's Iron Ore exports. The leaders in the Goan Iron Ore industry include Sesa Goa (now owned by Vedanta) and Dempo Agriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew and coconut. The fishing industry provides employment for about forty thousand people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, perhaps coupled with the fact that traditional fishing has given way to large-scale mechanised trawling. Medium scale industries include the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilisers, tyres, tubes, footwear, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wheat products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, brewery products. Goa is also notable for its low liquor prices due to its very low excise duty on alcohol. Another source of cash inflow into the state comes from many of its citizens who work abroad and remit money to their families. Zuari Industries (2005 gross income Rs.36,302 million) and Sesa Goa (2005 gross income Rs.17,265 million) are two S&P CNX 500 conglomerates which have corporate offices in Goa. The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more special economic zones(SEZs) in Goa. This is in stark contrast to policy followed by other states of India. SEZs are known to bring tax revenues for the government and employment option for local citizens since industries flock there for lower tax rates as compared to other areas. Currently there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. This decision was taken by state government after strong opposition to SEZs by political parties and Goa catholic church.  Goa's sole airport, the Dabolim Airport, is both a military and civilian airport catering to domestic and international airlines that stop en route to other Indian destinations. In addition to regular flights, the airport handles a large number of chartered flights. Goa receives International flights from Dubai, Sharjah and Kuwait in the Middle East and from the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia during the charter flight tourist season. Dabolim airport is serviced by the following carriers - Air India, Indian Airlines, Air Deccan, Kingfisher airlines, Go air, Spice jet, Jet Airways besides Charter flights from Thomas Cook (condor) etc. Goa's public transport largely consists of privately operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas. Government-run buses, maintained the Kadamba Transport Corporation, links both major routes (like the Panjim–Margao route) and some remote parts of the state. In large towns such as Panjim and Margao, intra-city buses ply. However, public transport in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transport, usually motorised two-wheelers. Goa has two National Highways passing through it. NH-17 runs along India's west coast and links Goa to Bombay in the north and Mangalore to the south. NH-4A running across the state connects the capital Panjim to Belgaum in east, linking Goa to cities in the Deccan. The NH-17A connects NH-17 to Mormugao Harbour from Cortalim, and the new NH-17B, once complete will be a four lane highway connecting Mormugao Harbour to NH-17 at another location, Verna, via Dabolim airport. Goa has a total of  of National highway,  of state highway and 815&nbsp;km of district highway. Hired forms of transport include unmetered taxis, and, in urban areas, auto rickshaws. A unique form of transport in Goa is the Motorcycle taxi, operated by drivers who are locally called "pilots". These vehicles transport a single pillion rider, at fares that are usually negotiated prior or after the journey (it is always better to ask locals on the correct fare before you try any negotiations yourself). In some places in Goa, there are river crossings which are serviced by the ferry boats, operated by the river navigation departments. Goa has two rail lines — one run by the South Western Railway and the other by the Konkan Railway. The line run by the South Western Railway was built during the colonial era linking the port town of Vasco da Gama with Hubli in Karnataka via Margao. The Konkan Railway line, which was built during the 1990s, runs parallel to the coast connecting Mumbai to the Malabar Coast. The Mormugao harbour near the city of Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal and international containers. Much of the shipments consist of minerals and ores from Goa's hinterland. Panjim, which is situated on the banks of the Mandovi, also has a minor port, which used to handle passenger steamers between Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s. A native of Goa is called a Goan in English, 'Goenkar' in Konkani, 'Goês' (male) or 'Goesa' (female) in Portuguese, and a 'Govekar' in Marathi. Goa has a population of 1.344 million residents, making it India's fourth smallest (after Sikkim, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh). The population has a growth rate of 14.9% per annum. There are 363 people for each square kilometre of the land. 49.77% of the population lives in urban areas. The sex ratio is 960 females to 1000 males. Hinduism (65.8%), Christianity (26.7%) and Islam (6.8%) are the three main religions in Goa. http://www.censusindia.net/religiondata/ 2001 Indian Census Data Roman Catholicism reached Goa during the period of European colonisation, which began in 1498 when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama arrived on the Malabar coast. With the establishment of Goa Inquisition in 1560, a large sections of the population became Roman Catholic. There is also a small community of Sikhs that make up 0.1% of the population. Goa's major cities include Vasco, Margao, Marmagao (also known as Murgaon or Mormugão), Panjim and Mapusa. The region connecting the last four cities is considered a de facto conurbation, or a more or less continuous urban area. The official language of Goa is Konkani. Following the end of Portuguese rule, the most widely used languages are Konkani and Marathi. Konkani is the primary spoken language; English and Marathi for official, literary or educational purposes;The Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987 makes Konkani the sole official language, but provides that Marathi may also be used for "for all or any of the official purposes". The Government also has a policy of replying in Marathi to correspondence received in Marathi.   and other languages including Hindi and Portuguese. Language is a controversial issue in Goa, over which an agitation was fought between two contending pro-Konkani and pro-Marathi camps between 1985–87. Most of the Goans united and fought for Konkani as their mother tongue. After the agitation ended in 1987, a complex formula grants 'official language' status to Konkani, while Marathi is also allowed to be used "for any or all official purposes." Given the bitter rivalry between the two lobbies, clubbed with a maudlin issue has resulted in a stalemate over the actual implementation. Portuguese, the earlier language of the elite, has been hit by shrinking numbers, though a small number still prefer it as the medium for discourse at home, and a few Portuguese books have even been published in recent years. English, viewed as a language of opportunity and social mobility, is widely understood by many of the state residents.   The most popular celebrations in Goa are Christmas, Easter Sunday, Ganesh Chaturthi (Chavoth-Konkani), Diwali, New Year's Day, Shigmo and the Carnival. However, since the 1960s, the celebrations of the Shigmo and carnival have shifted to the urban centres, and in recent times these festivals are seen more as a means of attracting tourists. Celebrations for all festivals usually last for a few days and include parties and balls. Western English songs have a large following in most parts of Goa. Traditional Konkani folk songs also have a sizable following. Manddo, the traditional Goan music which originated in the nineteenth century, is sung and danced on special occasions. Goa is also known for its Goa trance music. In the year 2006, the AIR FM channel ran a program "Goa Top 10", which listed the most requested tracks of the week. During analysis, it emerged that the song "Faithful" by Lobo had an unusually high, consistent popularity, in spite of not being a fresh track. Thus, this song is arguably Goa's favourite English song, and has been referred to as Goa's English anthem. It has been found that Goans have a preference for pop music, soft rock, ballads and country music over hard rock, hip-hop, etc. Some traditional Goan dance forms are dekhnni, fugdi, and corridinho. Rice with fish  curry (Xit kodi in Konkani) is the staple diet in Goa. Goa is renowned for its rich variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes. Coconut and coconut oil is widely used in Goan cooking along with chili peppers, spices and vinegar giving the food a unique flavour. Pork dishes such as Vindaloo, Xacuti and Sorpotel are cooked for major occasions among the Catholics. An exotic Goan vegetable stew, known as Khatkhate, is a very popular dish during the celebrations of festivals, Hindu and Christian alike. Khatkhate contains at least five vegetables, fresh coconut, and special Goan spices that add to the aroma. A rich egg-based multi-layered sweet dish known as bebinca is a favourite at Christmas. The most popular alcoholic beverage in Goa is feni; Cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms. Goa has two World Heritage Sites: the Bom Jesus Basilica [ ] and a few designated convents. The Basilica holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier, regarded by many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa (the patron of the Archdiocese of Goa is actually the Blessed Joseph Vaz. Once every decade, the body is taken down for veneration and for public viewing. The last such event was conducted in 2004. The Velhas Conquistas regions are also known for its Goa-Portuguese style architecture. In many parts of Goa, mansions constructed in the Indo-Portuguese style architecture still stand, though in some villages, most of them are in a dilapidated condition. Fontainhas in Panjim, has been declared a cultural quarter, and are used as a living museum showcasing the life, architecture and culture of Goa. Some influences from the Portuguese era are visible in some of Goa's temples, notably the Mangueshi Temple, although after 1961, many of these were demolished and reconstructed in the indigenous Indian style.  The    height    of    Goa's    glory    was    closely    and    mutually  linked   with   the   heyday   of   Portugal,  but  Goan   grandeur   pre-dated   the  Portuguese.    Chieftains,   kings   and   a   host   of   Indian   dynasties   had  made   this   little   jewel   glitter   with   royal   pomp.   The   Batpuras,   the  Bhujas     and,     after  the   fall   of   Ashoka  and the Mauryans,  the Satyavahanas, ruled  over  Goa. The inscription of around A.D.1000  (when     Shashtadeva  of the Goa Kadamba dynasty  sat   on   the   throne),  describes    the    early  splendor       of       the  capital:        'Gardens  on       every       side.White            plastered  houses,   alleys,   horse   stables,   flower   gardens,   agreeably   connected  bazaars,   harlots'   quarters,   and   tanks.'   In   his   son's   reign,   Goa   is  reputed  to  have  commanded  a  powerful  fleet  and  traded  with  four-  teen  foreign  lands.In   essence,   it   was   a   coveted   land   with   the   most   sought-after   port  in  India.  And  as  the  word  spread,  this  advantage  was  to  become  a  liability.      The   friendly   harbours   that   had   sent   out   sparkling   blue  ripples   to   the   world   were   to   backflow   and   become   the   road   of  conquest  and  colonization. On  July  4,  1497  when  Vasco  da  Gama  set  sail  from  the  River  Tagus   in   Lisbon   commanding   the   flagship   St.   Gabriel,   no   one  could   have   imagined   the   implications   of   his   voyage.   At   that   time  the  potentates  of  the  East  were  wealthier  than  the  financially  em-  barrassed  Western  kings.Vasco  da  Gama  never  actually  visited  Goa,  though  now  there  is  a  coastal   town   by   his   name   to   commemorate   his   link   with   Portugal.  It   was   Afonso   de   Albuquerque   who   is   credited   with   sowing   the  seeds   of   the   Portuguese   empire   in   India,   first   by   destroying,   then creating. the     Arabian   Sea   into   the   fresh   mouth   of   the   Mandovi.   Little   did   anyone  know   that   Goa   would   change   face.   Now   a   stranger   on   the   throne  was  to  remould  the  past,  reshape  the  present  and  go  so  far  as  to  influence  the  future  psyche  of  an  entire  people. The   Portuguese   brought   to   Goa   the   magnificence   of   the   West   and  the   might   of   a   nation   at   the   height   of   its   imperial   power.   Their  vision   was   lofty   and ambition sky high,   but   it   blazed   a   short   trail  like   a   meteor.   An  art   historian   remarked,   'Portugal   was   a   very   small   nation   of   a  people   then   heroic.      However,   at   its   peak,   Goa   was   one   of   the  wonders  of  the  world,  larger  than  Lisbon  and  even  the  London  of its   time!   Some   300,000   people   had   made   it   their   home.   Goa   re-  sembled  the  'meeting  upon  the  burse  in  Antwerpe'  wrote  Linschoten,  the  Dutchman,  and  it  was  then  that  epithets  like  'Rome  of  Asia'  and  'Pearl  of  the  Orient'  were  coined.  'Goa  Dourada'  or  'Golden  Goa'  sands   was   not   an   advertising   slogan   to   beckon   tourists,   but   more  precisely  the  gilt-coated  reredos  and  altars  in  the  churches  that  dis-  played  layers  of  the  real  gold  Portugal  had  discovered  in  Africa. Contemporary  descriptions  do  not  undertake  this  glitter.  'Quem  viu  Goa   excusa   de   ver  Lisboa',     the     word  went    round,    'Who  has         seen         Goa  needn't                    see  Lisbon.'      In      1606  Goa        got        Santa  Monica,     the     first  nunnery       in       the  East.   The   imposing  Basilica      of      Bom  Jesus           impressed  Christians  and  non-Christians alike. Fantastic Italian    architecture-typically    renaissance  modelled  on  architectural  details  from  the  churches  circled  the  city's  skyline. There   were   compulsory   orders   to   paint   the   mansions   annually,   af-  ter    the    monsoon    had    passed.    The    regulations    insisted    that    al-  though   white   may   be   used   for   picking   out   architectural   details  like   quoins   and   cornices,   and   window   edges   and   balustrades   to  contrast  with  the  wall  surfaces  of  yellow-ochre,  Indian  red  or  pale  green,  no  buildings  but  churches  might  be  white  all  over. In  1839,  Caption  Marryat  in  his  novel  The  Phantom  Ship  de described   Goa:   'The   squares   behind   the   palace   and   the   wide   streets  were   filled   with   living   beings:   elephants   with   gorgeous   trappings;  led  or  mounted  horses  with  superb  housings;  palanquins  carried  by  natives   in   splendid   liveries;   running   footmen;   syces;   every   variety  of   nation,   from   the   proud   Portuguese   to   the   half-covered   native;  Musselmen,   Arabs,   Hindoos,   Armenians;   Officers   and   soldiers   in  their   uniforms,   all   crowded   and   thronged   together:   all   was   bustle  and   motion.   Such   was   the   wealth,   the   splendor   and   luxury   of   the  proud   city   of   Goa-   the   Empress   of   the   East.'  Football is perhaps the most popular sport in Goa and is embedded in Goan culture. Its origins in the state are traced back to 1883 when the visiting British priest Fr. William Robert Lyons established the sport as part of a "Christian education". On December 22, 1959 the Associacao Futebol de Goa was formed, which continues to administer the game in the state under the new name, Goa Football Association. Goa, along with West Bengal,and Kerala. is the locus of football in the country and is home to many football club in India's National Football League, including three of the ten Premier Division teams. The state's football powerhouses include Salgaocar, Dempo, Churchill Brothers, Vasco Sports Club and Sporting Clube de Goa. The state's main football stadium, Fatroda (or Nehru stadium), is located at Margao and also hosts cricket matches. In recent decades, a growing influence of cricket is visible, in large part fuelled by the massive coverage this sport gets on national television, thus making an impact even in a part of South Asia which hardly had any contact with the British Empire. Goa now has its own cricket team. Field Hockey is the third most popular sport. Panaji, known as Panjim in English and earlier called Pangim in Portuguese times, and known in the local language as Ponnje is the administrative capital of Goa lying on the left bank of the Mandovi near Panaji. Goa's legislative capital is Porvorim &ndash; the seat of the Goa assembly, which lies across the Mandovi River. The state's judicial capital, however, is Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay, which is the capital of Goa's neighbouring Maharashtra state), as the state comes under the Bombay High Court. A bench of the High Court is present in Panaji. Goa contributes two seats to the Lok Sabha and one to the Rajya Sabha, in India's bicameral parliament. Unlike other states, which follow the British Indian model of civil laws framed for individual religions, the Portuguese Uniform Civil Code, based on the Napoleonic code, has been retained by the Goa government. Goa has a unicameral legislature consisting of a forty member Legislative Assembly, headed by a Chief Minister who wields the executive power. The present Chief Minister of Goa is Mr. Digamber Kamat and the Leader of Opposition is Mr. Manohar Parrikar. The ruling government consists of the party or coalition garnering the most seats in the state elections and enjoying the support of a simple majority of the House. The governor is appointed by the President of India. The governor's role is largely ceremonial, but plays a crucial role when it comes to deciding who should form the next government or in suspending the legislature as has happened in the recent past. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005.Odds stacked against Parrikar, Anil Sastry, The Hindu, 2005-01-31, verified 2005-04-02 In March 2005 the assembly was dissolved by the governor and President's Rule was declared, which suspended the legislature. A by-election in June 2005 saw the Congress coming back to power after winning three of the five seats that went to polls. The Congress party and the BJP are the two largest parties in the state. In the assembly pole of 2007, Congress-led coalition won and started ruling the state. Other parties include the United Goans Democratic Party, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party.[20]http://northgoa.nic.in/  Goa is served by almost all television channels available in India.

Goa has number of local news channels registered under CABLE NEWS CHANNEL ASSOCIATION which are as follows. GOA365 (ENGLISH), GOAPLUS (ENGLISH & KONKANI), INGOA (MARATHI)  Each taluka is made up of villages, each having a school run by the government. Due to the low levels of corruption and the quality of the government schools, private schools are less in demand, compared to the rest of the country. All schools come under the state SSC whose syllabus is prescribed by the state Education department. There are also a few schools run by the all-India ICSE board. Most students in Goa complete their high school using English as the medium of instruction. Primary schools, on the other hand are largely run in Konkani (in private, but government-aided schools). As is the case in most of India, enrollment for vernacular media has seen a fall in numbers in favour of English medium education.  After ten years of schooling, students join a Junior College which offers courses in popular streams such as Science, Arts, Law and Commerce. Additionally, many join three year diploma courses. Two years of college is followed by a professional degree. The Goa University is the sole university in the state located in Taleigao and all Goan colleges are affiliated to it. There are four engineering colleges and one medical college in the state. The Goa Engineering College and Goa Medical College are run by the state whereas the other three engineering colleges are run by private organisations. The other private engineering colleges are BITS Pilani Goa Campus, Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Shiroda, and Padre Conceicao College of Engineering, Verna. There are also colleges offering pharmacy, architecture and dentistry along with numerous private colleges offering law, arts, commerce and science. Many residents, however, choose to take up courses in other states as the demand for a course in Goa is more than that available. Goa is also well-known in India for courses in marine engineering, fisheries, hotel management and cuisine. The State also hosts a  business school - the Goa Institute of Management which is autonomous and was founded in 1993 by Fr. Romuald D'souza. Portuguese is taught as a part of the school curriculum, often as a third language in some schools. The Goa University also offers Bachelors and Masters degrees in Portuguese.     bpy:গৱা simple:Goa Gross State Domestic Product at Current Prices (in millions of Indian Rupees) figures in crores of Indian Rupees Year Gross State Domestic Product 1980 3,980 1985 6,550 1990 12,570 1995 33,190 2000 76,980 The 1961 Armed Liberation of Goa Patriarchate of the East Indies Timeline of Goan history Goa Trance Jan Huyghens van Linschoten Arambol Navelim Chinchinim Chapora Beach List of people from Goa List of Goan Christian surnames Houses of Goa Public squares in Goa Shanta Durga temple Saraswat cuisine Media in Goa Tourism in Goa Government of Goa official website Government of Goa information website The Goa Jesuits Chabad of Goa Goa Blog [20 http://northgoa.nic.in/] | Banknotes used in Goa during the Portuguese era  :LINKNUM:421
