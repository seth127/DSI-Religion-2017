   Montenegro (Montenegrin/Serbian: Црна Гора, Crna Gora (, ), Albanian: Mali i Zi ()) is a country located in Southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south and borders Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia and its partially recognized breakaway southern province of Kosovo to the northeast and Albania to the southeast. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as Prijestonica, the old royal capital or former seat of the throne. A Serbian principality in the Late Middle Ages, its independence from the Ottoman Empire was formally recognized in 1878. From 1918, Montenegro became a part of various incarnations of Yugoslavia and the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. Based on the results of the referendum held on May 21 2006, Montenegro declared independence on June 3, 2006 making it the newest fully recognized country in the world. On June 28, 2006, it became the 192nd member stateList of members to the United Nations by joining date of the United Nations, and on May 11, 2007, the 47th member state of the Council of Europe.Directorate of Communication - The Republic of Montenegro becomes 47th Council of Europe member state Montenegro's native name, Crna Gora, is mentioned for the first time in 1296 by King Stefan Uroš I in his edicts to the Serbian Orthodox Zeta Episcopate seat at the Vranjina island in Lake Scutari. Geography. The origin of the term lies in the Slavic reference to excessively mountainous regions, often emerging in the medieval Serbian realm. Mentioned afterwards in most Nemanyidens' edicts and in subsequent Venetian sources in the 13th and 14th centuries, signifying the area of the Upper Zeta, the name stabilized itself for a Principality in the second half of the 15th century under Lord Ivan Crnojević, mostly confounding erroneously the term with the dynasty's name, which both have similar roots. The region itself became remembered as Old Montenegro (Стара Црна Гора / Stara Crna Gora) as by the 19th century The Highlands were added to the state, and Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century during wars against the Ottomans, expanding its name to and annexing Old Herzegovina and parts of Old Serbia, most notably Metohija and southern Rashka. The state changed little to modern day reference, losing Metohija (western Kosovo) and gaining the Bay of Kotor. The term gave the name to its people, the Montenegrins (Црногорци / Crnogorci). The country's name in most Western European languages, including English, reflects an adoption of the Venetian term , also meaning "black mountain", which probably dates back to the era of Venetian hegemony over the area in the Middle Ages. Other languages, particularly nearby ones, use their own direct translation of the term "black mountain" (e.g. Albanian: , Bulgarian: Черна гора, Cherna gora, Czech: , Greek: , Mavrovoúnio, Polish: Czarnogóra, Romanian: , Slovene: , Slovak: Čierna hora, and Turkish: ). Names from further afield include  and  (pinyin: "hēishān"this literal translation is used in Mainland China and Hong Kong; Taiwanese Mandarin uses  "méngtènèigēluó", a phonetic transcription of "Montenegro") The ISO Alpha-2 code for Montenegro is ME and the Alpha-3 Code is MNE.ISO 3166-1 Newsletter No. V-12, Date: 2006-09-26   The first recorded settlers of Montenegro were Illyrians, the Docleata. In 9 AD the Romans conquered the region of present-day Montenegro. Slavs massively colonized the area in the 5th and 6th centuries, forming a semi-independent principality, Doclea, that was involved in the Balkan medieval politics with ties with minor Rascia and major Byzantium and to a lesser extent Bulgaria, becoming a Kingdom in 1077. By the end of the 12th century fully incorporated into a unified Serbian realm, the "Zeta" was governed by Nemanjics preparing to assert the throne. After the Serbian Empire collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, a family came to prominence by expanding their lordship in present-day Montenegro, the Balšićs. In 1421 it was annexed to the Serbian Despotate, but after 1455 another local noble family, the Crnojevićs, ruling the Principality of Montenegro that until the end of the 15th century became the last free monarchy of the Balkans, finally falling to the Ottomans in 1499, annexing it to the sanjak of Skadar. For a short time Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous sanjak in 1514-1528, an alteration of which existed again some time between 1597 and 1614. In the 16th century Montenegro developed a form of special and unique autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, the local Serb clans were free of many bonds. Nevertheless the Montenegrins refused to accept Ottoman reign and in the 17th century raised numerous rebellions, culminating with the Ottoman defeat in the Great Turkish War at the end of the century. Montenegro factually became a theocracy led by the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitans, flourishing ever since the Petrović-Njegoš became the traditional Prince-Bishops. The Venetian Republic introduced Governors that mettled into Montenegrin politics, succeeded by the Austrian Empire in 1797, it was abolished by Prince-Bishop Petar II in 1832. His predecessor Petar I contributed to the unification of Montenegro with the Highlands.  Under Nicholas I, the Principality of Montenegro vastly advanced and enlarged several times in the Serbo-Turkish Wars and achieved recognition of independence in 1878. Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. Political rifts for the first time emerged between the reigning People's Party that supported democratization of the ruler's autocratic regime and unconditional union with Serbia and the minor pro-monarch True People's Party. In 1910 Montenegro became a Kingdom. It initiated the Balkan wars in 1912 and 1913 in which the Ottomans lost all lands in the Balkans, achieving a common border with Serbia, but the Skadar was awarded to a newly created Albania. In World War I in 1914 Montenegro sided with Serbia against the Central Powers, suffering a full scale defeat to Austria-Hungary in early 1916. In 1918 the Serbian Army liberated Montenegro, which elected a union with the Kingdom of Serbia. In 1922 Montenegro formally became the Zeta Area of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in 1929 it became a part of a larger Zeta Banate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In World War II Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis forces in 1941, who established a fascist puppet Independent State of Montenegro, liberated by the Partisans in 1944. Montenegro became a constituent republic of the Communist Yugoslavia, its capital renamed to Titograd in honor of Tito. More and more autonomy was established, until SR Montenegro got its last Constitution in 1974. After the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro kept a smaller Yugoslavia with Serbia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.   In the referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992, 95.96% of the votes were cast for remaining in the federation with Serbia, although the turnout was at 66% because of a boycott by the Muslim, Albanian and Catholic minorities as well as of pro-independence Montenegrins. The opposition claimed that poll was organised under undemocratic conditions, during war time in the former Yugoslavia, with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote. There is no impartial report on the fairness of the referendum, as the 1992 referendum was totally unmonitored, unlike the 2006 vote, which has been closely monitored by the European Union. During the recent Bosnian War and Croatian War (1991-1995) Montenegro participated with its police and paramilitary forces in the attacks on Dubrovnik and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops. It conducted persecutions against Bosniak refugees who were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foča, where they were executed.PORODICA NEDŽIBA LOJE O NJEGOVOM HAPŠENJU I DEPORTACIJI 1992. GODINE [ ] In 1996, Milo Đukanović's government de facto severed ties between Montenegro and Serbia, which was then still under Milošević. Montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the Deutsche Mark as its currency. It has since adopted the Euro, though it is not formally part of the Eurozone. Subsequent governments of Montenegro carried out pro-independence policies, originally restored by the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite the political changes in Belgrade. Despite its pro-independence leanings, targets in Montenegro were repeatedly bombed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force in 1999. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement regarding continued cooperation and entered into negotiations regarding the future status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, the Yugoslav federation was replaced in favor of a looser state union named Serbia and Montenegro and a possible referendum on Montenegrin independence was postponed for a minimum of three years.  The status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by the referendum on Montenegrin independence on May 21, 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate. 230,661 votes or 55.5% were for independence and 185,002 votes or 44.5% were against.BBC News: Montenegro vote result confirmed The 45,659 difference narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have all recognized Montenegro's independence; by doing so they removed all remaining obstacles from Montenegro's path towards becoming the world's newest sovereign state. The 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an OSCE/ODIHR monitoring team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from CEMI, CEDEM and other organizations). The OSCE/ODIHR ROM joined efforts with the observers of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE) and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM—in its preliminary report—"assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation." Furthermore, the report assessed that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that "there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights." On June 3 2006, the Parliament of Montenegro declared the independence of MontenegroBBC News: Montenegro declares independence, formally confirming the result of the referendum on independence. Serbia did not obstruct the ruling, confirming its own independence and declaring the Union of Serbia and Montenegro ended shortly thereafter. On September 6 2007 an advisor of the Prime Minister of Serbia called Montenegro a 'quasi-state'Index - Diplomáciai botrány Szerbia és Montenegró között. Montenegro gave a protest list to the Serbian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia, Božidar Đelić, has apologised for this.

Historically, its territory is composed by the following geo-historical entities Old Montenegro, The Highlands, Old Herzegovina, the Montenegrin Littoral, or the Bay of Kotor in specific, and to an extent Old Serbia. Some of the biggest cities and towns in Montenegro are: Montenegro ranges from high peaks along its borders with Serbia and Albania, a segment of the Karst of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only one to four miles wide. The plain stops abruptly in the north, where Mount Lovćen and Mount Orjen plunge abruptly into the inlet of the Bay of Kotor. Montenegro's large Karst region lies generally at elevations of 1,000&nbsp;metres (3,281&nbsp;ft) above sea level; some parts, however, rise to 2,000&nbsp;metres (6,560&nbsp;ft), such as Mount Orjen (1,894&nbsp;m / 6,214&nbsp;ft), the highest massif among the coastal limestone ranges. The Zeta River valley, at an elevation of 500&nbsp;meters (1,640&nbsp;ft), is the lowest segment. The mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in Europe. They average more than 2,000&nbsp;metres (6,560&nbsp;ft) in elevation. One of the country's notable peaks is Bobotov Kuk in the Durmitor mountains, which reaches a height of 2,522&nbsp;metres (8,274&nbsp;ft). The Montenegrin mountain ranges were among the most ice-eroded parts of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period. See also: Foreign relations of Montenegro, Military of Montenegro Montenegro is defined as a "Civic, democratic, ecological and state of social justice, based on the reign of Law". It is an independent and sovereign Republic. It proclaimed its new Constitution on 22 October 2007. The current Government of the Republic of Montenegro (Vlada Republike Crne Gore) is composed of the prime minister, the deputy prime ministers as well as ministers. Željko Šturanović was the Prime Minister of Montenegro and head of the Government, but he resigned due to health reasons. The ruling party in Montenegro ever since multiparliamentarism is the controversial centre-left Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) (Demokratska Partija Socijalista Crna Gore), in coalition with the much smaller center-right Social Democratic Party of Montenegro (SDP) (Socijaldemokratska Partija Crne Gore).  The President of Montenegro is elected for a period of five years through direct elections. According to the constitution, the President will represent the republic in the country and abroad, promulgate laws by ordinance, call elections for the Parliament, propose candidates for the Prime Minister, president and justices of the Constitutional Court to the Parliament, propose to the Parliament calling of a referendum, grant amnesty for criminal offences prescribed by the national law, confer decoration and awards, and perform all other duties in accordance with the Constitution. The President shall also be a member of the Supreme Defence Council. The Montenegrin Parliament (Skupština Republike Crne Gore) passes all laws in Montenegro, ratifies international treaties, appoints the Prime Minister, ministers, and justices of all courts, adopts the budget and performs other duties as established by the Constitution. The Parliament can pass a vote of no-confidence on the Government by a majority of the members. One representative is elected per 6,000 voters, which in turn results in a reduction of total number of representatives in the Parliament of Montenegro. The current president of the Parliament is Ranko Krivokapić. The present Parliament convening 81 seats instead of previous number of 75 (parliamentary elections were on 10 September 2006 and were the first after the proclamation of independence. The constituent Parliament session took place on 2 October 2006). A new official flag of Montenegro was adopted on July 13 2004, by the Montenegrin legislature. The new flag is based on the royal standard of King Nikola I of Montenegro. This flag was all red with a gold border, a gold coat of arms, and the initials НІ in Cyrillic script (corresponding to NI in Latin script) representing King Nikola I. These initials are omitted from the modern flag and replaced with a golden lion. The national day of 13 July marks the date in 1878 when the Congress of Berlin recognised Montenegro as the 27th independent state in the world and the start of one of the first popular uprisings in Europe against the Axis Powers on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro. In 2004, the Montenegrin legislature selected a popular Montenegrin traditional song, Oh, Bright Dawn of May, as the national anthem. Montenegro's official anthem during the reign of King Nikola was  (To our beautiful Montenegro). The Montenegrin popular anthem has unofficially been Onamo, 'namo! since King Nikola I wrote it in the 1860s.   Montenegro is divided into twenty-one municipalities (opština), and two urban municipalities, subdivisions of Podgorica municipality:      During the era of communism Montenegro experienced a rapid period of urbanization and industrialization. An industrial sector based on electricity generation, steel, aluminum, coal mining, forestry and wood processing, textiles and tobacco manufacture was built up, with trade, overseas shipping, and particularly tourism, increasingly important by the late 1980s. The loss of previously guaranteed markets and suppliers after the breakup of Yugoslavia left the Montenegrin industrial sector reeling as production was suspended and the privatization program, begun in 1989, was interrupted. The disintegration of the Yugoslav market, and the imposition of the UN sanctions in May 1992 were the causes of the greatest economic and financial crisis since World War II. During 1993, two thirds of the Montenegrin population lived below the poverty line, while frequent interruptions in relief supplies caused the health and environmental protection to drop below the minimum of international standards. The financial losses under the adverse effects of the UN sanctions on the overall economy of Montenegro are estimated to be approximately $6.39 billion. This period also experienced the second highest hyperinflation in history (3 million percent in January 1994) (The highest hyperinflation happened in Hungary after the end of World War II, when inflation there hit 4.19&nbsp;x&nbsp;1016 percent). In 1997, Milo Đukanović took control over the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) and began severing ties with Milosevic' Serbia. He blamed the policies of Slobodan Milošević for the overall decline of the Montenegrin economy, as well as Milošević's systematic persecution of non-Serbs. Montenegro introduced the German mark as response to again-growing inflation, and insisted on taking more control over its economic fate. This eventually resulted in creation of Serbia and Montenegro, a loose union in which Montenegro mostly took responsibility for its economic policies. This was followed by implementation of faster and more efficient privatization, passing of reform laws, introduction of VAT and usage of Euro as Montenegro's legal tender.   According to 2003 census, Montenegro has 620,145 citizens. If the methodology used up to 1991 was used in the 2003 census, Montenegro would officially have 673,094 citizens. Most recent estimates stake somewhere below 700,000 inhabitants. When the census was taken Montenegro was a non-national civic state. In the meantime, the Constitution was changed, hence it now recognizes the major ethnic groups living in it: Montenegrins, Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians, Muslims, Croats and Romas. Ethnic composition according to the 2003 census:Official results of the 2003 Montenegrin census Most citizens speak the Serbian language of the Iyekavian dialect. However, as of 2004 the moves for an independent Montenegrin language were promoted and with the new 2007 Constitution it became Montenegro's prime official language. Next to it, Serbian, Albanian, Bosnian and Croatian are recognized in usage. Most Montenegrin inhabitants are Orthodox Christians, followers of the Serbian Orthodox Church's Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral. The religious institutions all have guaranteed rights and are separate from the state, there is a handful of Sunni Muslims in Montenegro that maintain their own Islamic Community of Montenegro. There is also a small Roman Catholic population, divided onto the Achdiocese of Antivari headed by Serbian Primates and the Diocese of Kotor that is a part of the Church of Croatia. Religious determination according to the census: According the newest report, there are 24,610 total refugees from the Yugoslav wars in Montenegro, forming 4.2% of the total population. 16,136 are refugees from Kosovo after 1999 and 8,474 expelled from Croatia and Bosnia.     The culture of Montenegro has been shaped by a variety of influences throughout history. The influence of Orthodox South Slavic, Central European, and seafaring Adriatic cultures (notably parts of Italy, like the Republic of Venice) have been the most important in recent centuries. Montenegro has many significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is especially well known for its religious monuments, including the Cathedral of Saint Tryphon in Kotor Kotor (Cattaro under the Venetians), the basilica of St. Luke (over 800 years), Our Lady of the Rocks (Škrpjela), the Savina Monastery and others. Montenegro's medieval monasteries contain thousands of square metres of frescos on their walls. The traditional folk dance of the Montenegrins is the Oro, a circle dance that involves dancers standing on each other's shoulders in a circle while one or two dancers are dancing in the middle. The first literary works written in the region are ten centuries old, and the first Montenegrin book was printed five hundred years ago. The first state-owned printing press was located in Cetinje in 1494, where the first South Slavic book, Oktoih, was printed the same year. Ancient manuscripts, dating from the thirteenth century, are kept in the Montenegrin monasteries. Montenet - History of Montenegro: Crnojevic Rule Montenegro's capital Podgorica and the former royal capital of Cetinje are the two most important centers of culture and the arts in the country.  Education in Montenegro is regulated by the Montenegrin Ministry of Education and Science. Education stars in either pre-schools or elementary schools. Children enroll in elementary schools (Serbian: Osnovna škola) at the age of 6; it lasts 9 years. The students may continue their secondary education, which lasts 4 years (3 years for trade schools) and ends with graduation (Matura). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years. Serbia and Montenegro were represented by a single football team in the 2006 FIFA World Cup tournament, despite having formally split just weeks prior to its start. Following this event, this team has been inherited by Serbia, while a new one was organized to represent Montenegro in international competitions.UEFA: Montenegro set for big adventure On March 24, 2007, the Montenegrin national team came from behind to win its first ever fixture, 2-1, in a friendly game against Hungary at the Podgorica Stadium. Montenegro take a bow at victory On their 119th Session in Guatemala City in July 2007, the International Olympic Committee granted recognition and membership to the newly formed Montenegrin National Olympic Committee. Montenegro is set to debut at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The first official international representation of Montenegro as an independent state was in the Miss World 2006 celebrated on September 30, 2006 in Warsaw, Poland. Ivana Knežević from the city of Bar was the first Miss Montenegro at any international beauty pageant. Both Montenegro and Serbia competed separately in this pageant for the first time after the state union came to an end. Part of the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale is set in Montenegro, although the filming was done in Czech Republic. Nero Wolfe, the eccentric fictional detective created by American writer Rex Stout, is Montenegrin by birth. One Nero Wolfe novel, The Black Mountain, takes place in Tito-era Montenegro. Jay Gatsby, the main character of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby, supposedly fought in Montenegro in World War I, and had been given a medal of honour by the Montenegrin King Nicholas I.      als:Montenegro ang:Sweartbeorg arc:ܛܘܪܐ ܐܘܟܡܐ frp:Montènègro ast:Montenegru zh-min-nan:O͘-soaⁿ Kiōng-hô-kok be-x-old:Чарнагорыя ceb:Montenegro dsb:Carnogórska hsb:Čorna Hora ilo:Montenegro bpy:মন্টিনিগ্রো nah:Tlīltepēc nds-nl:Montenegro nap:Montenegro nrm:Crna Gora nov:Montenegro pms:Montnèigr crh:Montenegro sco:Montenegro scn:Montenegru simple:Montenegro cu:Чрьна Гора sh:Crna Gora vec:Montenégro war:Montenegro zh-yue:黑山 diq:Montenegro bat-smg:Joudkalnėjė Number % TOTAL 620,145 100 Montenegrins 267,669 43.16 Serbs 198,414 31.99 Bosniacs 48,184 7.77 Albanians 31,163 5.03 Muslims 24,625 3.97 Croats 6,811 1.1 Romany 2,601 0.42 others 40,678 6.56 Number % TOTAL 620,145 100 Serbian 393,740 63.49 Montenegrin 136,208 21.96 Albanian 32,603 5.26 Bosnian 14,172 2.29 Croatian 2,791 0.45 other 40,631 6.55 Number % TOTAL 620,145 100 Orthodox 460,383 74.24 Muslim 110,034 17.74 Catholic 21,972 3.54 other 27,756 4.48 Date Name Notes 1 January New Year's Day (non-working holiday) 7 January Orthodox Christmas (non-working) 14 January Julian New Year's Day 25 April Orthodox Good Friday Date for 2008 only 27 April Orthodox Easter Date for 2008 only 28 April Orthodox Easter Monday Date for 2008 only 1 May Labour Day (non-working) 9 May Victory Day 21 May Independence Day (non-working) 13 July Statehood Day (non-working) Podgorica (capital; 136,473 inhabitants) Nikšić (58,212) Pljevlja (21,377) Bijelo Polje (15,883) Cetinje (The former royal capital and the seat of the throne; 15,137) Bar (13,719) Herceg Novi (12,739) Berane (11,776) Longest beach: Velika Plaža, Ulcinj — 13,000&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;miles) Highest peak: Zla Kolata, Prokletije at 2,534 m Largest lake: Skadar Lake — 391&nbsp;km² (151&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of surface area Deepest canyon: Tara River Canyon — 1,300&nbsp;m (4,265&nbsp;ft) Biggest bay: Bay of Kotor National parks: Durmitor — 390&nbsp;km² (150&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), Lovćen — 64&nbsp;km² (25&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), Biogradska Gora — 54&nbsp;km² (21&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), Lake Scutari — 400&nbsp;km² (154&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) UNESCO World Heritage sites: Durmitor and Tara River Canyon, old city of Kotor.
