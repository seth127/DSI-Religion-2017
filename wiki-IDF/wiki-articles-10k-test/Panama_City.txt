Panama City is the political and administrative center of the country. Juan Carlos Navarro is Panama City's current mayor. Panama City has been for 7 years in the top 5 places for retirement in the world according to International Living Magazine“International Living 2007 Retirement Index” Panama City has a dense skyline, including mostly apartment buildings, but office complexes and hotels as well. Panama City is an important hub for international banking and commerce. It has an advanced communications service, Internet use is widespread; and Panama City's Tocumen International Airport offers daily flights to international destinations.“International Living -Panama Live (See at the infraestructure paragraph)" Panama City was chosen to be the American Capital of Culture for the year 2003 (jointly, with Curitiba, Brazil). The city was founded on August 15, 1519, by Pedro Arias de Ávila. Within years of its founding, the city became a launching point for the exploration and conquest of Peru and a transit point for gold and silver headed towards Spain. In 1671, the Welsh pirate Henry Morgan, with the help of a band of 1400 men, attacked and looted the city, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. The ruins of the old city still remain and are a popular tourist attraction known as Panamá la Vieja (Old Panama). It was rebuilt in 1673 in a new location approximately 5 miles southwest of the original city. This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city. Two years after the start of the California Gold Rush in 1848, the Panama Railroad Company was formed,The Panama Railroad from Trainweb but the railroad did not begin operation until 1855.Harper's New Monthly Magazine March 1855, Volume 10, Issue 58, p.543 Between 1848 and 1869, the year the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the United States, about 375,000 persons crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 in the opposite direction. That traffic greatly increased the prosperity of the city during that period. The construction of the Panama Canal was of great benefit to the infrastructure and economy. Of particular note are the improvements in health and sanitation brought about by the American presence in the Canal Zone. These include the eradication of yellow fever and malaria and the introduction of a first-rate water supply system. However, most of the workers involved in the construction of the canal were brought in from the Caribbean, which created unprecedented racial and social tensions in the city.  During World War II, construction of military bases and the presence of larger numbers of U.S. military and civilian personnel brought about unprecedented levels of prosperity to the city. Panamanians had limited access, or no access at all, to many areas in the Canal Zone neighboring the Panama City metropolitan area.  Some of these areas were military bases accessible only to United States personnel. Tensions arose between the people of Panama and the U.S. citizens living in the Panama Canal Zone. This erupted in the January 9, 1964 riots. In the late 1970s through the 1980s Panama City became an international banking center, bringing a lot of undesirable attention as an international money-laundering center. In 1989 after nearly a year of tension between the United States and Panama, President George H. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama to depose the leader of Panama, General Manuel Noriega. As a result of the action a portion of the El Chorrillo, a neighborhood which consisted mostly of old wood-framed buildings dating back to the 1900s, was destroyed by fire. Eventually, the U.S. helped finance the construction of large cinderblock apartment buildings to replace the destroyed structures. Panama City remains a major banking center, although with very visible controls against money laundering. Shipping is handled through port facilities in the area of Balboa operated by the Hutchison Whampoa Company of Hong Kong and through several ports on the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Balboa, which is located within the greater Panama City metropolitan area, was formerly part of the Panama Canal Zone, and in fact the administration of the former Panama Canal Zone was headquartered there. Panama City is located in the Pacific Coast of Panama, east of the Panama Canal.  Panama City has a rainy season that stretches from May to December, and a Dry season from January to April. Year temperatures range between 21°C and 35°C. "Panama City Hall" The city has numerous tourist attractions including world-class hotels and restaurants. Particularly interesting for tourists are various sites located in the old quarter (also commonly referred to as "Casco Viejo", "Casco Antiguo" or "San Felipe"), including   The area immediately east of the Pacific entrance of the canal--known as the Amador CausewayJogging in Paradise...but where is everbody? The Panama Report-- is currently being developed as a major tourist center. Currently the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute operates a station and a small museum open to the public on Culebra Island, just off the island of Naos (See inset). A new museum, The Bridge of Life Museum, is currently under construction on the causeway. The Bridge of Life Museum was designed by the American architect Frank Gehry famous for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Disney Concert Center in Los Angeles and it is scheduled to be completed in 2009.Panama:Bridge of Life|Biodiversity Museum Panama La Vieja (Old Panama) is the name used for the architectural vestiges of the Monumental Historic Complex of the first Spanish city founded on the Pacific coast of the Americas by Pedro Arias de Avila on 15 August 1519. This city was the starting point of the expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru (1532)(The year the egiptions were at war). It also was a stopover point of one of the most important trade routes in the history of he American continent leading to the famous fairs of Nombre de Dios (worshpers Name) and Portobelo where most of the gold and Silver that Spain took from the Americas passed through. "World Heritage Site" The Committee decided to inscribe this property on the basis of cultural criteria (ii), (iv) and (vi), considering that Panamá was the first European settlement on the Pacific coast of the Americas, in 1519, and the Historic District preserves intact a street pattern, together with a substantial number of early domestic buildings, which are exceptional testimony to the nature of this early settlement. The Salón Bolivar is of outstanding historical importance, as the venue for Simón Bolivar's visionary attempt in 1826 to create a Pan-American congress, more than a century before such institutions became a reality."UNESCO Official Site" The City Proper has around 813,097 inhabitants in the 23 Panama City Boroughs.“Panama City Hall (Spanish” Panama City is located between the Pacific Ocean and many tropical rain forests. The Parque Natural Metropolitano (Metropolitan Nature Park), stretching from Panama city along the Panama Canal, has several unique bird species and other animals such as tapir, puma, alligators, etc. At the Pacific entrance of the canal is the Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas (Marine Exhibitions Center), a research center for those interested in tropical marine life and ecology. Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas is managed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Tropical forests around Panama City are vital for the functioning of the Panama Canal. These forests provide the canal with the watershed required for its operation (a rare example of a vast engineering project in the middle of the forest which actually helped preserve that very nature). Due to the importance of the Canal to the Panamanian economy, tropical forests around the canal have been kept in an almost pristine state. Along the western side of the Canal is the Parque Nacional Soberania (Sovereignty National Park) which includes Summit botanical gardens and a zoo. In this national park, the best known trail is the Pipeline Road, very popular among birdwatchers.Canopy Tower, a famous birdwatchers hotel Due to lack of urban planning throughout several decades, Panama City is now facing several urban problems. With the large number of condominiums and office buildings being built, population density is increasing far beyond previously expected."burica wordpress" Neighborhoods like El Cangrejo and El Carmen, originally designed for a density of 10,000 inhabitants per square kilometer (26,000/sq mi) are now reaching 35,000 inhabitants per square kilometer (91,000/sq mi).“La Prensa Newspaper” The city's downtown streets are overcrowded with cars, creating traffic problems.“La Prensa Newspaper” In addition, Panama City's existing water supply piping system is not receiving enough maintenance and this is causing several water pollution related problems. Another important problem is the shape of the city: Panama City has grown following the shape of a narrow strip along the coast as it expands to the northeast. This is mainly due to the fact that Panama City is limited in the south by the Pacific Ocean, in the north by the protected lands of the Metropolitan Park and other national parks of the Panama Canal Basin, and in the west with the Panama Canal itself. Subsequently Panama City has expanded mostly eastwards, in an irregular funnel-like shape. Panama City has a total of 79 banks, two of them being national. The city also boasts several tourist attractions, and is a stopover for other nearby destinations in the country as well as a tourist destination in its own right. The city is also responsible for the production of about 55% of the country's GDP. This due to the fact that most businesses and premises are located in the city and its metro area.http://municipio.gob.pa/ The communications systems are highly developed and are among Central America's most reliable. Internet use is widespread due to Panama's high income.“International Living -Panama Live Panama City currently has more than 110 skyrise projects being constructed, with 127 highrise buildings already built.“Skyscraper page Panama City” It currently holds the 65th place in the world by highrise buildings count.“Skyscraper page Cities List” The Centennial Bridge, that crosses the Panama Canal earned the American Segmental Bridge Institute prize of excellence together with 7 other bridges in the Americas. “La Prensa Newspaper” Panama City counts 11 medical complexes. Around 45% of Panama physicians are located in Panama City.“Panama City Hall – Healthcare” Panama offers good-quality medical care and modern hospitals in the metropolitan area, however, the more isolated the location, the harder it is to access these services. The hospitals offer first-rate medical care. Many Panamanian doctors are U.S. trained, and the standards at the top hospitals compare favorably to those in the United States.“International Living Healthcare Overview” Panama City's international airport, Tocumen International Airport, located on the eastern outskirts of the city, is easily accessible.
