 Nova Scotia ()  (Latin for New Scotland; ; ) is a Canadian province located on Canada's southeastern coast. It is the most populous province in the Maritimes.  Its capital, Halifax, is a major economic centre of the region.  Nova Scotia is the second smallest province in Canada, with an area of 55,284 km².  Its population of 934,782 makes it the fourth least populous province of the country, though second most densely populated. Nova Scotia's economy is traditionally largely resource-based, but has in recent decades become more diverse.  Industries such as fishing, mining, forestry and agriculture remain very important, and have been joined by tourism, technology, film, music, and finance. The province includes several regions of the Mi'kmaq nation of Mi'gma'gi, which covered all of the Maritimes, as well as parts of Maine, the Gaspé, and Newfoundland.  Nova Scotia was already home to the Mi'kmaq people when the first European colonists arrived.  In 1604, French colonists established the first permanent European settlement north of Florida at Port Royal, founding what would become known as Acadia.  The British Empire obtained control of the region between 1713 and 1760, and established a new capital at Halifax in 1749. In 1867 Nova Scotia was one of the founding provinces of the Canadian Confederation, along with New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada (which became the separate provinces of Quebec and Ontario).  The province's mainland is the Nova Scotia peninsula surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, including numerous bays and estuaries. No where in Nova Scotia is more than 67 km (40 mi) from the ocean.  Cape Breton Island, a large island to the northeast of the Nova Scotia mainland, is also part of the province, as is Sable Island, a small island notorious for its shipwrecks, approximately 175 km (95 nm) from the province's southern coast.  Nova Scotia is Canada's second smallest province in area (after Prince Edward Island). Nova Scotia is also Canada's most southern province even though it does not have the most southern location in Canada. That is held by Ontario. Northern Ontario keeps the central region of Ontario farther north than Nova Scotia.  Nova Scotia's economy has traditionally been largely resource-based, but has in recent decades become more diverse. The founding of Nova Scotia was driven by the ready availability of natural resources, especially the fish stocks of the Scotian shelf.  A pillar of the economy from its development by the French in the 1600s, the collapse of the cod stocks in 1992, which also eliminated approximately 20,000 jobs, has been followed by a slow but steady decline of the sector as a whole as most stocks are under stress. The per capita GDP in 2005 was $31,344, lower than the national GDP of $34,273 and less than half that of Canada's richest province, Alberta. Mining is also a significant sector, especially of gypsum, salt and barite. Since 1991, offshore oil and gas has become a more important part of the economy. Agriculture remains an important sector in the province. Around the central part of Nova Scotia, lumber and paper industries are responsible for much of the employment opportunities.  The government of Nova Scotia is a parliamentary democracy.  Its unicameral legislature, the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, consists of fifty-two members.  As Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II is the head of Nova Scotia's Executive Council, which serves as the Cabinet of the provincial government.  Her Majesty's duties in Nova Scotia are carried out by her representative, the Lieutenant-Governor, currently Mayann E. Francis.  The government is headed by the Premier, Rodney MacDonald, who took office February 22, 2006. Halifax is home to the House of Assembly and Lieutenant-Governor. The province's revenue comes mainly from the taxation of personal and corporate income, although taxes on tobacco and alcohol, its stake in the Atlantic Lottery Corporation, and oil and gas royalties are also significant.  In 2006/07, the Province passed a budget of $6.9 billion, with a projected $72 million surplus.  Federal equalization payments account for $1.385 billion, or 20.07% of the provincial revenue.  While Nova Scotians have enjoyed balanced budgets for several years, the accumulated debt exceeds $12 billion (including forecasts of future liability, such as pensions and environmental cleanups), resulting in slightly over $897 million in debt servicing payments, or 12.67% of expenses.  The province participates in the HST, a blended sales tax collected by the federal government using the GST tax system. Nova Scotia has elected three minority governments over the last decade.  The Progressive Conservative government of John Hamm, and now Rodney MacDonald, has required the support of the New Democratic Party or Liberal Party since the election in 2003.  Nova Scotia's politics are divided on regional lines in such a way that it has become difficult to elect a majority government.   Rural mainland Nova Scotia has largely been aligned behind the Progressive Conservative Party, Halifax Regional Municipality has overwhelmingly supported the New Democrats, with Cape Breton voting for Liberals with a few Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats.  This has resulted in a three-way split of votes on a province-wide basis for each party, and difficulty in any party gaining a majority.  Progressive Conservative Premier Dr. Hamm announced his retirement in late 2005 and was replaced by Rodney MacDonald after MacDonald won a closely contested leadership convention, defeating former finance minister, and the race's frontrunner, Neil LeBlanc on the first ballot and Halifax businessman Bill Black on the second. MacDonald is the second youngest premier in Nova Scotia's history. The last election on June 13, 2006 elected 23 Progressive Conservatives, 20 New Democrats and 9 Liberals, leaving Nova Scotia with a Progressive Conservative minority government. Nova Scotia no longer has any incorporated cities, as they were amalgamated into Regional Municipalities in 1996. Halifax, the provincial capital, is now part of the Halifax Regional Municipality, as is Dartmouth, formerly the province's second largest city.  The former city of Sydney is now part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. The House of Assembly passed a motion in 2004 inviting the Turks and Caicos Islands to join the province, should these Caribbean islands renew their wish to join Canada.[ ]   In the province of Nova Scotia, the Minister of Education is responsible for the administration and delivery of education, as defined by the Education Act and other acts relating to colleges, universities and private schools.  The powers of the Minister and the Department of Education are defined by the Ministerial regulations and constrained by the Governor-In-Council regulations. Nova Scotia has more than 450 public schools for children. The public system offers primary to Grade 12. There are also some private schools in  the province.  Public education is administered by seven regional school boards, responsible primarily for English instruction and French immersion, and also province wide by the Conseil Scolaire Acadien Provincial, which administer French instruction to students for whom the primary language is French. The Nova Scotia Community College system has 13 campuses around the province.   The community college, with its focus on training and education, was established in 1988 by amalgamating the province's former vocational schools. The province has 11 universities and colleges, including Dalhousie University, University of King's College, Saint Mary's University (Halifax), Mount Saint Vincent University, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Acadia University, Université Sainte-Anne, Saint Francis Xavier University, Nova Scotia Agricultural College, Cape Breton University. Despite the small population of the province, Nova Scotia's music and culture is influenced by several well established cultural groups, that are sometimes referred to as the "founding cultures." Originally populated by the Mi'kmaq First Nation, the first European settlers were the French, who founded Acadia in 1604. Nova Scotia was briefly colonized by Scottish settlers in 1620, though by 1624 the Scottish settlers had been removed by treaty and the area was turned over to the French until the mid-1700s. After the defeat of the French and prior expulsion of the Acadians, settlers of English, Irish, Scottish and African descent began arriving on the shores of Nova Scotia. Settlement was greatly accelerated by the resettlement of Loyalists in Nova Scotia during the period following the end of the American revolutionary war. It was during this time that a large African Nova Scotian community took root, populated by freed slaves and Loyalist blacks and their families, who had fought for the crown in exchange for land.  This community later grew when the Royal Navy began intercepting slave ships destined for the United States, and deposited these free slaves on the shores of Nova Scotia. Later, in the 1800s the Irish Famine and, especially, the Scottish Highland Clearances resulted in large influxes of migrants with Celtic cultural roots, which helped to define the dominantly Celtic character of Cape Breton and the north mainland of the province.   This Gaelic influence continues to play an important role in defining the cultural life of the province, though less than 500 Nova Scotians today are fluent in Scottish Gaelic. Nearly all live in Antigonish County or on Cape Breton Island. Modern Nova Scotia is a mix of many cultures. The government works to support Mi'kmaq, French, Gaelic and African-Nova Scotian culture through the establishment of government secretariats, as well as colleges, educational programs and cultural centres.  The Province is also eager to attract new immigrants, but has had limited success. The major population centres at Halifax and Sydney are the most cosmopolitan, hosting large Arab populations (in the former) and Eastern European populations (in the latter). Halifax Regional Municipality hosts a yearly multicultural festival.  According to the 2001 Canadian census the largest ethnic group in Nova Scotia is Scottish (29.3%), followed by English (28.1%), Irish (19.9%), French (16.7%), German (10.0%), Dutch (3.9%), First Nations (3.2%), Welsh (1.4%), Italian (1.3%), and Acadian (1.2%). Almost half of all respondents (47.4%) identified their ethnicity as "Canadian." Top Ten Counties by Population The 2006 Canadian census showed a population of 913,462.Of the 899,270 singular responses to the census question concerning 'mother tongue' the most commonly reported languages were:  In addition, there were also 105 responses of both English and a 'non-official language'; 25 of both French and a 'non-official language'; 495 of both English and French; 10 of English, French, and a 'non-official language'; and about 10,300 people who either did not respond to the question, or reported multiple non-official languages, or else gave some other unenumerated response. Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.Detailed Mother Tongue (186), Knowledge of Official Languages (5), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) (2006 Census) Nova Scotia has long been a centre for artistic and cultural excellence.  Halifax has emerged as the leading cultural centre in the Atlantic region.  The city hosts such institutions such as NSCAD University, one of Canada's leading art, craft and design colleges, and the Symphony Nova Scotia, the only full orchestra performing in Atlantic Canada.  The province is home to a full spread of expression, from avant guard visual art and traditional crafting, from writing and publishing to an, at times, vibrant film industry. Nova Scotia is arguably best known for its music.  Music is a part of the warp and weft of the fabric of Nova Scotia's cultural life. This deep and lasting love of music is expressed the through the performance and enjoyment of all types and genres of music. While popular music from many genres has experienced almost two decades of explosive growth and success in Nova Scotia, the province remains best known for its folk and traditional based music. Nova Scotia's traditional, or folk music, is characteristically Scottish in character, and traditions from Scotland are kept very traditional in form, in some cases more so than in Scotland. This is especially true of the island of Cape Breton, one of the major international centers for Celtic music. On main land Nova Scotia, particularly in some of the rural villages throughout Guysborough County, Irish influenced styles of music are commonly played, due to the predominance of Irish culture in many of the county's villages.   Ellen Page, Academy-Award nominee for Best Actress in Juno, was born and raised in Nova Scotia, and still resides there today. The Showcase program Trailer Park Boys takes place and is filmed in Nova Scotia. In the popular Carly Simon song "You're so Vain", Nova Scotia is mentioned in the following verse: "Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga/ And your horse naturally won./ Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia/ To see the total eclipse of the sun." Scottish electronica band Boards of Canada included a track called "Nova Scotia Robots" on a number of their early, self-released albums. John Mayer's song "This Will All Make Perfect Sense Someday" includes the line "And if it ever gets bad/ I mean really bad/ I'll move to Nova Scotia/ Forget the life I had/ I'll be up at 9 each morning/ Down by the shore/ Collecting things that fell off boats in storms/ Well ok so I might never/ But it's nice to know the option's there."  The Nova Scotia tourism industry includes more than 6,500 direct businesses, supporting nearly 40,000 jobs. [ ] Nova Scotia lies in the northern temperate zone and, although the province is almost surrounded by water, the climate is continental rather than maritime.  The temperature extremes of the continental climate are moderated by the ocean. Described on a provincial vehicle license plate as Canada's Ocean Playground, the sea is a major influence on Nova Scotia's climate.  Nova Scotia is known to have cold winters and warm summers.  The province is surrounded by three major bodies of water, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the north, the Bay of Fundy to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east. Over its 350-mile (565 kilometres) length, Nova Scotia has a modified continental climate, comparable to that of northern Europe.  The southwestern and southern shores of Nova Scotia have both milder and wetter climates than the rest of the province.  Rainfall varies from 1.4 metres (55 inches) in the south to 1 metre (40 inches) elsewhere.  Nova Scotia is also very foggy in places, with Halifax averaging 196 foggy days per yearhttp://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=59317&refer=&units=us and Yarmouth 191.  http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=30617&refer=&units=us The average annual temperatures are: Because of the ocean's effect on the weather Nova Scotia is the warmest of the provinces in the Atlantic region.  Nova Scotia also has a fairly wide but not extreme temperature range, a late and short summer, skies that are often cloudy or overcast; frequent coastal fog and marked changeability of weather from day to day. The main reasons of Nova Scotia's climate can be related to four basic factors: As Nova Scotia juts out into the Atlantic, it is prone to tropical storms and hurricanes in the summer and autumn. There  have been 33 such storms, including 12 hurricanes, since records were kept in 1871 - about once per four years.  The last hurricane was category-two Hurricane Juan in September 2003, and the last tropical storm was in Tropical Storm Noel in 2007.  Paleo-Indians camped at locations in present-day Nova Scotia approximately 11,000 years ago.  Archaic Indians are believed to have been present in the area between 1,000 and 5,000 years ago.  Mi'kmaq, the First Nations of the province and region, are their direct descendants. Some believe that the Vikings may have settled in Nova Scotia at some time, though there is little evidence of this and the claim is disputed by historians.  The only authenticated Viking settlement in North America is L'Anse aux Meadows, which establishes the fact that Vikings explored North America 500 years before Christopher Columbus. While there is some debate over where he landed, it is most widely believed that the Italian explorer John Cabot visited present-day Cape Breton in 1497.  [ ].  The first European settlement in Nova Scotia was established in 1604.  The French, led by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts established the first capital for the colony Acadia at Port Royal in 1604 at the head of the Annapolis Basin. Also, French fishermen established a settlement at Canso the same year. In 1620, the Plymouth Council for New England, under King James I (of England) & VI (of Scots) designated the whole shorelines of Acadia and the Mid-Atlantic colonies south to the Chesapeake Bay as New England. The first documented Scottish settlement in the Americas was of Nova Scotia in 1621. On 29 September 1621, the charter for the foundation of a colony was granted by James VI to William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling and, in 1622, the first settlers left Scotland. This settlement initially failed due to difficulties in obtaining a sufficient number of skilled emigrants and in 1624, James VI created a new order of Baronets. Admission to this order was obtained by sending six labourers or artisans, sufficiently armed, dressed and supplied for two years, to Nova Scotia, or by paying 3,000 merks to William Alexander. For six months, no one took up this offer until James compelled one to make the first move. In 1627, there was a wider uptake of baronetcies, and thus more settlers available to go to Nova Scotia. However, in 1627, war broke out between England and France and the French re-established a settlement at Port Royal which they had originally settled. Later that year, a combined Scottish and English force destroyed the French settlement, forcing them out. In 1629, the first Scottish settlement at Port Royal was inhabited. The colony's charter, in law, made Nova Scotia (defined as all land between Newfoundland and New England) a part of mainland Scotland, this was later used to get around the English navigation acts. However, this did not last long: in 1631, under King Charles I, the Treaty of Suza was signed which returned Nova Scotia to the French. The Scots were forced by Charles to abandon their mission before their colony had been properly established and the French assumed control of the Mi'kmaq and other First Nations territory. In 1654, King Louis XIV of France appointed aristocrat Nicholas Denys as Governor of Acadia and granted him the confiscated lands and the right to all its minerals. English colonists captured Acadia in the course of King William's War, but England returned the territory to France in the Treaty of Ryswick at the wars end.  The territory was recaptured by forces loyal to Britain during the course of Queen Anne's War, and its conquest confirmed by the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. France retained possession of Île St Jean (Prince Edward Island) and Île Royale (Cape Breton Island), on which it established a fortress at Louisbourg to guard the sea approaches to Quebec. This fortress was captured by American colonial forces, then returned by the British to France, then ceded again after the French and Indian War of 1755. Thus mainland Nova Scotia became a British colony in 1713, although Samuel Vetch had a precarious hold on the territory as governor from the fall of Acadian Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal) in October 1710. British governing officials became increasingly concerned over the unwillingness of the French-speaking, Roman Catholic Acadians, who were the majority of colonists, to pledge allegiance to the British Crown, then George II.  The colony remained mostly Acadian despite the establishment of Halifax as the province's capital, and the settlement of a large number of  foreign Protestants (some French and Swiss but mostly German) at Lunenburg in 1753. In 1755, the British forcibly expelled  over 12,000 Acadians in what became known as the Grand Dérangement, or Great Expulsion. The colony's jurisdiction changed during this time. Nova Scotia was granted a supreme court in 1754 with the appointment of Jonathan Belcher and a Legislative Assembly in 1758. In 1763 Cape Breton Island became part of Nova Scotia.  In 1769, St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony.  The county of Sunbury was created in 1765, and included all of the territory of current day New Brunswick and eastern Maine as far as the Penobscot River.  In 1784 the western, mainland portion of the colony was separated and became the province of New Brunswick, and the territory in Maine entered the control of the newly independent American state of Massachusetts.  Cape Breton became a separate colony in 1784 only to be returned to Nova Scotia in  1820.  Ancestors of more than half of present-day Nova Scotians arrived in the period following the Acadian Expulsion.  Between 1759 and 1768, about 8000 New England Planters responded to Governor Charles Lawrence's request for settlers from the New England colonies. Several years later, approximately 30,000 United Empire Loyalists   (American Tories) settled in Nova Scotia (when it comprised present-day Maritime Canada) following the defeat of the British in the American Revolutionary War.  Of these 30,000, 14,000 went to New Brunswick and 16,000 went to Nova Scotia. Approximately 3,000 of this group were slaves of African ancestry, about a third of which soon relocated themselves to Sierra Leone in 1792.  Large numbers of Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots emigrated to Cape Breton and the western part of the mainland during the late 18th century and 19th century.  About one thousand Ulster Scots settled in mainly central Nova Scotia during this time, as did just over a thousand farming migrants from Yorkshire and Northumberland between 1772 and 1775. Nova Scotia was the first colony in British North America and in the British Empire to achieve responsible government in January-February 1848 and become self-governing through the efforts of Joseph Howe. Pro-Confederate premier Charles Tupper led Nova Scotia into the Canadian Confederation in 1867, along with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada. In the provincial election of 1868, the Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 Federal seats, and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature.  For seven years, William Annand and Joseph Howe led the ultimately unsuccessful fight to convince British imperial authorities to release Nova Scotia from Confederation.  The government was vocally against Confederation, contending that it was no more than the annexation of the province to the pre-existing province of Canada:  A motion passed by the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1868 refusing to recognise the legitimacy of Confederation has never been rescinded.  Repeal, as anti-confederation became known, would rear its head again in the 1880s, and transform into the Maritime Rights Movement in the 1920s.  Some Nova Scotia flags flew at half mast on Dominion Day as late as that time.   ang:Nīwe Scotland zh-min-nan:Nova Scotia pdc:Nei-Schottland pam:Nova Scotia lij:Neuva Scossia pms:Neuva Scòssia simple:Nova Scotia bat-smg:Naujuojė Škuotėjė   Symbols of Nova Scotia Official  Dog Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever  Official  Gemstone Agate  Official  Tartan Nova Scotia Tartan Official  Mineral Stilbite  Official  Fossil Hylonomus lyelli Official  Schooner The Bluenose II  County  2001 2006 Halifax 359,183 372,858 Cape Breton (county) 109,330 105,928 Kings County 58,866 60,035 Colchester County 49,307 50,023 Lunenburg County 47,591 47,150 Pictou County 46,965 46,513 Hants County 40,513 41,182 Cumberland County 32,605 32,046 Yarmouth County 26,843 26,277 Annapolis County 21,773 21,438 1.
