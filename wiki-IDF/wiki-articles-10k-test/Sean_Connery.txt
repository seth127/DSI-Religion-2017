   Sir Thomas Sean Connery (born August 25 1930) is a Scottish actor and producer who is perhaps best known as the first actor to portray James Bond in cinema, starring in seven Bond films. In 1988 he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables. Sir Sean Connery was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in July 2000. Connery is known for retaining his Scottish accent in films, regardless of the nationality of the character played, and for his rugged good looks. He has repeatedly been named as one of the most attractive men alive by various magazines, despite the fact that he is older than most sex symbols. Connery was born in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh to a factory worker and truck driver father and a charwoman mother. His father, Joseph Connery, was a Roman Catholic of Irish descent with roots in County Wexford, while his mother, Euphamia "Effie" Maclean, was a Protestant. He claims he was called Sean, his middle name, long before becoming an actor, explaining that he had an Irish friend named Séamus and those who knew them decided to call him by his middle name when with Séamus. His first job was as a milkman in Edinburgh with St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society. He then joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged on medical grounds because of a duodenal ulcer. Afterwards, he returned to the co-op, then worked at other jobs, including a lorry driver, a labourer and an artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. According to Connery's official website, he placed third in the 1950 Mr. Universe bodybuilding contest. Fellow competitor, Johnny Isaacs, suggested he audition for a stage production of South Pacific, which led to stage, television, and film work. A prominent television role was in Rudolph Cartier's 1961 production of Anna Karenina for BBC Television, in which he co-starred with Claire Bloom. He also acted in Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1956) starring Albert Sharpe; his first American television role was as a porter in an episode of The Jack Benny Show. Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He acted in seven Bond films, six produced by EON, followed by an unofficial Warner Brothers Thunderball-remake: These include Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983) (unofficial). The imposing, yet light-footed, actor was co-discovered by Harry Saltzman, and Albert R. Broccoli after other aspirants to the Bond role were eliminated, including David Niven (later to play Bond in the spoof Casino Royale, in 1967), Cary Grant, and James Mason; the latter two refused to commit to a film series. The low budget forced the producers to hire an unknown actor. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming doubted the casting, saying, "He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks" and "I’m looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man", adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2", and a Scot) was unrefined. However, Fleming's girlfriend told him Connery had the requisite sexual charisma. Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No premiere; he was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for the literary James Bond in the later novels. Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Robert Cotton wrote in one Connery biography that Lois Maxwell (the first Miss Moneypenny) noticed, "Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat". Cotton wrote, "Some cast members remarked that Connery was simply doing a Terence Young impression, but Young and Connery knew they were on the right track." In June 1967, after filming You Only Live Twice, Connery quit the role, having tired of repetitive plots, a lack of character development, the public's demands of him, and fear of being typecast. He also disliked the fantastic direction in which the series was headed, away from the source material. Connery reportedly wanted to be a co-producer of the series, his inspiration being Dean Martin's role as a co-producer of the Matt Helm series. Connery noted that The Silencers made nowhere near as much money as Thunderball, but Martin made more money than he did. In 1970, United Artists agreed to finance Connery's production of The Offence. Connery's final official appearance as 007 was in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever; he reportedly declined £5 million to make Live and Let Die (1973). In 1978, owing to complex dealings between EON Productions and Kevin McClory (co-producer of Thunderball and co-creator of the story in Ian Fleming's eponymous novel), the latter obtained the right to re-make Thunderball. McClory and Connery were to write an original Bond film, titled either James Bond of the Secret Service or Warhead, but EON and United Artists blocked it in court. The re-make was revived in the 1980s, and Connery was to play Bond for the seventh, and final, time in the "unofficial" film Never Say Never Again; its title is said to derive from Connery's comment after filming Diamonds Are Forever that he'd never again play Bond. Yet, in 2005, Connery again reprised the role with his voice and physical likeness in the video game adaptation of From Russia with Love. His favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love, one of the most acclaimed in the series, which he confirmed in a 2002 interview with Sam Donaldson for ABCNews.com.; (American Movie Classics mistakenly listed Thunderball as Connery's favourite during a Bond retrospective). More than forty years after playing the role, Connery's incarnation remains as the definitive cinema James Bond, despite popular interpretations by Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton (often considered akin to the literary Bond), and Pierce Brosnan. Connery's feelings about James Bond range from resentment to fondness, once saying he hated the character so much that he'd have killed him, but also saying he never hated Bond, but merely wanted to portray other characters. Certainly, when the James Bond series was at its peak in the mid-1960s, his association with James Bond 007 was so great that his performances in films, such as Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, A Fine Madness, and Sidney Lumet's The Hill, were ignored. When asked if he'd ever escape the identification, he replied, "Never, it's with me 'til I go in the box". At another point, he said he still cared about the future of the character and the franchise, having been its icon for too long not to care, and that all Bond films had their good points. Although Bond was his most famous role, Connery has also maintained a successful career since. As part of the agreement to appear in Diamonds are Forever, Connery was given carte blanche to produce two films for United Artists, but felt that the only film made under this deal, The Offence, was buried by the studio. Apart from The Man Who Would Be King, most of Connery's successes in the next decade were as part of ensemble casts in films such as Murder on the Orient Express and A Bridge Too Far (in which he acted in a scene opposite Sir Laurence Olivier). His portrayal of Berber chieftain Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli in John Milius's The Wind and the Lion (1975) gained him considerable acclaim from critics and audiences and showed his range as an actor. In 1981, Sean Connery appeared in the film Time Bandits as Agamemnon. The casting choice derives from a joke Michael Palin included in the script, in which he describes the character as being "Sean Connery (or someone of equal, but cheaper, stature)". However, when shown the script, Connery was happy to play the supporting role. The brevity of his appearance in this film has been hailed by some as refreshing. After his experience with Never Say Never Again in 1983 and the following court case, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and for two years did not make any films. Following the successful European production The Name of the Rose (1986), for which he won a BAFTA award, Connery's interest in more credible material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in Highlander showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which would become a recurring role in many of his later films. The following year, his acclaimed performance as a hard-nosed cop in The Untouchables (1987) earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The media reported that the producers wanted him for the movie but could not afford his salary, so he agreed to do the movie for $50,000 with a ten percent share of the proceeds.  The expectation was that the movie would not make much money, but it exceeded all expectations and Sean Connery reaped a large amount of money.  It was one of the most publicized times that an actor had benefited so greatly from having "bet" on the future of the film and since then other actors have parlayed their acting skills into taking less up front for a part of the proceeds. Subsequent box-office hits such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) (in which he played Dr. Henry Jones, the father of Harrison Ford, actually only 12 years his junior), The Hunt for Red October (1990), (he was not the original actor for the film, and when that actor left the film, the producer/director who were good friends with Connery, called him in desperation and he agreed to do the movie out of friendship with two weeks notice, the media reported.) The Russia House (1990), The Rock (1996), and Entrapment (1999) re-established him as an actor capable of playing major parts. Just Cause (1995) drew attention to some of the issues surrounding race and the death penalty in America and controversially, serves as an endorsement for the practice.  Both Last Crusade and The Rock alluded to his James Bond days. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas wanted "the father of Indy" to be Connery since Bond directly inspired the Indiana Jones series, while his character in The Rock, John Patrick Mason, was a British secret service agent imprisoned since the 1960s. In more recent years, Connery's filmography has included several box office and critical disappointments such as The Avengers (1998), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) and First Knight (1995), but he also received positive reviews for films including Finding Forrester (2000). He also later received a Crystal Globe for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. He has often been criticised for never losing his accent, even when playing Russian and Irish characters, but he has said this is out of respect for his country. In 1987&ndash;88, Connery was to star in the British television series Red Dwarf. Connery was to appear as the captain of the spaceship Red Dwarf. However, the role was written as being slightly overweight and inept, and so, with the part not being a good fit for Connery, it eventually went to an American comedy actor, Mac McDonald. This was revealed in the Red Dwarf Series I DVD commentary. In September 2004, media reports indicated that Connery intended to retire after pulling out of Josiah's Canon, which was set for a 2005 release. However, in a December 2004 interview with The Scotsman newspaper from his home in the Bahamas, Connery explained he had taken a break from acting in order to concentrate on writing his autobiography. The book project was later abandoned because the publishers wanted to delve too far into his private life. Connery has long denied accusations from his first wife Diane Cilento that he physically abused her during their marriage. About a month before his 75th birthday, over the weekend of July 30/31, 2005, it was reported that he had decided to retire from film making following disillusionment with the "idiots now in Hollywood", and the turmoil making (and subsequent box office failure of) the 2003 film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. He stated in interviews for the film included on the DVD release that he was offered roles in both The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings series, declining both due to "not understanding them". After they went on to become huge hits, he decided to accept the League role, despite not "understanding" it either. At the Tartan Day celebrations in New York in March 2006, Connery again confirmed his retirement from acting, and stated that he is now writing a history book. He was planning to star in an $80 million movie about Saladin and the Crusades that would be filmed in Jordan before the producer Moustapha Akkad was killed in the 2005 Amman bombings. Connery received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 June 2006, where he again confirmed his retirement from acting. On 7 June 2007, he denied rumours that he would appear in the fourth Indiana Jones film, stating that "retirement is just too much damned fun". Sean Connery however did return to acting in one form, in the form of voice acting. As he played the title character in the animated short, "Sir Billi the Vet". Allegedly, while making the film Another Time, Another Place, Lana Turner was rumoured to have been having an affair with Connery, her co-star. Johnny Stompanato stormed onto the set. After Stompanato's death, there were rumours that organized crime mobsters had helped Connery bring on the eventual demise of Stompanato, and Connery is alleged to have laid low for a time. There is no evidence that Connery and Turner were having an affair; this sort of behaviour was apparently normal for Stompanato. Connery was married to the Australian-born actress Diane Cilento from 1962 until 1973 (he was her second husband). They have one son, Jason Connery (born January 11, 1963), who was educated at Millfield School in Somerset, England, and the rigourous Gordonstoun boarding school in Scotland, before going on to become an actor. According to Jason, his parents' divorce was an extremely bitter and painful affair (Diane Cilento has reportedly just written an autobiography that paints an unflattering portrait of her ex-husband). In 1975, Sean Connery married French artist Micheline Roquebrune, who is the grandmother of French television journalist Stéphanie Renouvin. He has one grandchild from his son Jason's marriage to actress Mia Sara, a grandson named Dashiell Quinn Connery (born in June, 1997). He holds an honorary shodan in Kyokushin karate. In her autobiography My Nine Lives, as well as in subsequent interviews on radio and in print, Diane Cilento claimed that Connery had beaten her on several occasions; Connery vehemently denied the accusations. He caused an uproar in a December 1987 interview with Barbara Walters, in which he said it was okay for a man to slap a woman with limited force, assuming that it was required to calm her down or "keep her in line". The interview with Walters referenced remarks Connery had made in a November 1965 interview with Playboy magazine on the set of Thunderball. In Vanity Fair in 1993 he said: "There are women who take it to the wire. That's what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack."  Connery has long supported the Scottish National Party, a left-of-centre political party campaigning for Scottish independence, both financially and through personal appearances. His involvement in Scottish politics has attracted considerable criticism since he has not resided in Scotland for more than fifty years, being labelled a "tax exile" amongst other things. His support for the SNP is illustrated by a comment from his official website: Connery has a "Scotland Forever" tattoo on his arm and used his fee from Diamonds Are Forever (1971) to establish a charity to support deprived children in Edinburgh as well as Scottish film production. He has said that he will return to Scotland when it is granted independence. He suggested in 1997 that the Labour government had prevented him being knighted for his charitable work because of his support for the SNP. At the time a Labour Party spokesman stated Connery's knighthood had been blocked because of the numerous remarks that the actor had made in past interviews condoning violence and physical abuse towards women. Connery received the Légion d'honneur in 1991. He received Kennedy Center Honors from the United States in 1999, presented to him by President Bill Clinton. He received a knighthood as a Knight Bachelor on July 5, 2000, wearing a hunting tartan kilt of the MacLean of Duart clan. He also received the Orden de Manuel Amador Guerrero from Mireya Moscoso, former president of Panama on 11 March 2003, for his talent and versatility as an actor. In 1993, news that Connery was undergoing radiation treatment for an undisclosed throat ailment sparked media reports that the actor was suffering from throat cancer following years of heavy smoking, and he was falsely declared dead by the Japanese and South African news agencies. Connery immediately appeared on the David Letterman show to deny all of this. In a February 1995 interview with Entertainment Weekly, he said that the radiation treatment was to remove nodules from his vocal cords. His father, a heavy smoker, died from throat cancer in 1972. In 2003, he had surgery to remove cataracts from both eyes. On March 12, 2006, he announced he was recovering from surgery to remove a kidney tumour in January. Connery's distinctive speaking voice has sometimes made him a target of satire, most notably in the recurring Saturday Night Live sketch "Celebrity Jeopardy!" In the sketches, Connery (as portrayed by Darrell Hammond) taunts and mocks host Alex Trebek (played by Will Ferrell) and makes numerous lewd references and jokes about women sexually. Hammond would also play Connery for a fake trailer for a live action Smurfs movie, where Connery played Papa Smurf. Comedian and talk show host Craig Ferguson has imitated Connery as well as Michael Caine, sometimes pairing the two together in a spliced sketch. Connery's role in Finding Forrester, specifically his line "You're the man now, dog!", became the inspiration for the popular website YTMND.com. He was voted to have the worst movie accent by Empire, for his performance in The Untouchables. He has been derided, but also applauded, for using the same accent for every character, despite playing roles as diverse as an Irish American Chicago cop (The Untouchables), King Richard I of England (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and a Lithuanian Soviet submarine captain (The Hunt for Red October). He has an asteroid named after him, 13070 Seanconnery. Connery is impersonated by Kelsey Grammer in his role as Frasier, in the eponymous Cheers spin-off. British comedian Eddie Izzard often impersonates Connery during his shows. Sean connery starred in his very own video game in 2005. It was based on the 1957 novel and the 1963 movie From Russia With Love.The game follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of earlier Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the jet pack from Thunderball (1965) and the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964). From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor. James Bond 007: From Russia with Love is the last video game EA Games marketed before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.The game begins with a standard pre-title sequence in which Elizabeth Stark, the British Prime Minister's daughter, is kidnapped by OCTOPUS while attending a party. Fortunately, Bond was assigned to attend the party for just such an event, and he defeats OCTOPUS and rescues Stark. Similar to the film, OCTOPUS has conceived a plan to embarrass British secret service agent 007 for the death of Dr. Julius No from the film Dr. No, in which No was an agent of SPECTRE (although not in the novel). The plan involves the theft of a Soviet encoding machine known as the Lektor with the help of a defecting Soviet agent, Tatiana Romanova. Romanova, however, is being used by OCTOPUS to lure James Bond into a trap; their ultimate goal is to let him obtain the Lektor and then ambush him for it, killing him in humiliating fashion as well. Romanova is sent by Rosa Klebb, an agent of the KGB (in both the novel and film, an agent of SMERSH) who has secretly defected to OCTOPUS. Her immediate subordinate, Donald "Red" Grant, protects Bond through the first half of the game and attacks him in the second. The game ends with a final assault on OCTOPUS headquarters, remiscent of the finale of you only live twice.                        simple:Sean Connery Year Film Role Other notes 1954 Lilacs in the Spring Undetermined Role (uncredited) 1957 No Road Back Spike Hell Drivers Johnny Kates Action of the Tiger Mike Time Lock Welder #2 1958 Another Time, Another Place Mark Trevor A Night to Remember Titanic deck hand uncredited 1959 Darby O'Gill and the Little People Michael McBride Tarzan's Greatest Adventure O'Bannion 1961 On the Fiddle Pedlar Pascoe The Frightened City Paddy Damion 1962 The Longest Day Pte.
