In Western cultures, particularly in the United States, birthday parties are often accompanied by colorful decorations such as streamers and balloons.

Housewarming parties are generally informal, and there are usually no planned activities besides a tour of the new house. A dinner party is a formal social gathering at which people eat dinner together, usually in the host's own home.

House parties which center around the consumption of beer which is pumped from a keg into plastic cups are called keg parties (or "Keggers").

The party is often exclusive to the performers and crew members, with a smaller number of guests who did not themselves participate in the performance. Cast parties are traditional for almost all acted performances, including amateur events such as high school plays. A "pre-party", also known as "pre-gaming" or "pre-funking", is an informal name for a party held prior to main events including: school dances, weddings, birthday parties, raves, or bar/bat mitzvahs. These are usually short and sometimes involve guests getting ready (putting on makeup, clothes, etc.) for the main event. After a pre-party, the guests usually leave at the same time to arrive at the main event together. Often, "pre-gaming" includes drinking alcohol before the party so one is "buzzed" before the actual party. An "after-party" is the informal name for a cast party, used in the professional music performance community. After parties are usually coordinated by the performers, and invitations are very selective. Only the performers, crew members and a small number of outside friends are invited. After-parties can also be held after school dances, bar/bat mitzvahs, weddings, and other large parties. However, only a few select close friends of the host would be invited to the after party instead of all the people who were invited to the primary event. The term is now used to advertise a club's affiliation with an event, in the hopes that people will go to the club afterwards to continue partying after the primary event is over. In smaller shows, these "after-parties" hosted by clubs will also attract the performers who may be on tour and thus not have a place to host a party.
