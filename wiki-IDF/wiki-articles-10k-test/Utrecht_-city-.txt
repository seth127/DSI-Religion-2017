   Utrecht () city is the capital and most populous city of the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is located in the North-Eastern end of the Randstad, and is the fourth largest city of the Netherlands, with a population of 288,535. The smaller Utrecht agglomeration counts some 420,000 inhabitants, while the larger region counts up to 820,000 inhabitants. Utrecht's ancient city-centre features many buildings and structures from its earliest origins onwards. It has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the eighth century CE. Currently it is the see of the Archbishop of Utrecht, the most important Dutch Roman Catholic leader. Utrecht is also the see of an archbishop of the Old Catholic church, and the location of the offices of the main protestant church. Utrecht is host to Utrecht University, the largest university of the Netherlands, as well as several other institutes for higher education. Due to its central position within the country it is an important transportation hub (rail and road) in the Netherlands. It has the second highest number of cultural events in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam. Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Bronze age (app. 1800-800 BCE), the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (castellum), probably built in the year 47 CE. These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort a settlement would grow housing artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children. A line of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand further North. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed. This line was located at the borders of the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today. The name of the Utrecht fortress originally was simply Traiectum denoting its location on the Rhine at a ford. Later the name was adorned with the prefix Ultra (on the far side) to distinguish it from other settlements (for example Mosa Trajectum Maastricht). Over time the two parts of the name would merge and evolve into the current name (Utrecht).  In the second century, the wooden walls were replaced by sturdier tuff stone walls, remnants of which are still to be found below the buildings around Dom Square. From the middle of the 3rd century Germanic tribes regularly invaded the Roman territories. Around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border and Utrecht was abandoned. Little is known about the next period 270-650. Utrecht is first spoken of again in the 7th century when the influence of the growing realms of the Franks lead Dagobert I to build a church devoted to Saint Martin within the walls of the Roman fortress. In ongoing border conflicts with the Frisians the church was however destroyed.  By the mid of the 7th century, English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisian. The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, archbishop of the Frisians; which is usually considered to initation of archbishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish king bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Roman catholic church in the Netherlands.  The see of the archbishops of Utrecht was located at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian empire. Furthermore it had to compete with the nearby trading centre Dorestad, also founded on the location of a roman fortress. The political turmoil in the Frankish realms after the death of Charlemagne, in combination with viking raids and domination lead to the downfall of Dorestad and established Utrecht as one of the most important cities in the Netherlands.   The importance of Utrecht as a centre of christianity is illustrated by the appointment of the Utrecht born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens to pope in 1522 (the last non Italian pope before John Paul II). When the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, the bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops. The realm of the bishopry included not only land the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht') but extended to the northeast. However, the feudalist system resulted in conflict between the different lords. The prince bishopry had its conflicts with the count of Holland and the dukes of Guelders.   The Veluwe was soon taken by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht. The clergy built several churches and monasteries inside, or close to the city of Utrecht. Most dominant of these was the gothic Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of this cathedral started in 1253 after an earlier romanesque cathedral had been badly damaged by fire. When the choir and transept were finished from 1320 the ambitious Dom tower was built. The central nave was the last part to be constructed from 1420. By that time, however, the time of the great cathedrals had and ended and the declining finances prevented this ambitious cathedral from being finished, resulting in the construction of the central nave being suspended before finishing the planned flying buttresses. Besides the cathedral there were four additional collegiate churches in Utrecht: Saint Saviour (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century.; Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039  and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives). Besides these churches the city housed Saint Paul abbey .  The 15th century beguine monastery of Saint Nicholas, and a 14th century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights. Besides these buildings which were part of the hierarchy of the bishopric; an additional four parish churches were constructed in the city: the Jacobichurch (dedicated to Saint James), founded in the 11th century, with the current gothic church dating back to the 14th century ; the Buurkerk (Neighbourhood-church) of the 11th century parish in the centre of the city; Nicolaichurch (dedicated to Saint Nicholas), from the 12th century  and the 13th century Geertekerk (dedicated to Saint Gertrude of Nivelles)  The location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town Utrecht received city rights in 1122.  When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed, which still flowed through the heart of the town became evermore canalized; and a unique wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system.  On the wharfs storage facilities (werfkelders) where built, on top of which the main street, including houses was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure.All other canal cities in The Netherlands (such as Leiden, Amsterdam and Delft) have the water in canals bordering directly to the road surface. The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy. The bishop, for example dammed the Lek at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and lead to the city of Utrecht commissioning a canal, the Vaartse Rijn, to connect Utrecht to the Lek at Nieuwegein; to insure access to the town for shipping trade. In 1528 the wordly powers of the bishop over both Neder- and Oversticht; including the city of Utrecht, were transferred to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who became the Lord of the 17 Netherlands (the current Benelux and the Northern parts of France). This transition was not an easy one and Charles V wanted to exert his power of the citizens of the city; who had achieved a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to give this power to their new lord. Charles decided to build a heavily fortified castle Vredenburg to house a large garrison with as most important task to maintain order in the city. The castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch revolt.  In 1579 the northern seven provinces of these Low Countries signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the one in Utrecht, which had become an archiepiscopal see in 1559. The lack of flying buttresses proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of St Martin church when Utrecht was struck by a tornado in 1674. Only in 1853 did the Dutch government allow the see to be reinstated (by Rome).  However, since 1723, but especially after 1870, Utrecht has been the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 settled the War of the Spanish Succession. Its most lasting result was the cession by Spain of Gibraltar to Great Britain. In the early 19th century the role of Utrecht as a fortified town became outdated. The old fortifications were outdated and the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie was move east of Utrecht. The ramparts could now be demolished to allow for growth. The water defenses remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact until today.  In 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network.  With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht finally began to grow far beyond the medieval center from the 1880s onward with the construction of neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, , Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During World War II, Utrecht was held by the Germans until the general German surrender of the Netherlands on 5 May, 1945. Canadian troops that surrounded the city entered it after that surrender, on May 7, 1945. Since World War II, the city has grown considerably when new neighbourhoods such as , , , , and (recently) Leidsche Rijn were built. Utrecht city has a population of 288,732. The total Utrecht agglomeration counts some 620,000 inhabitants. About 68% of the population is Dutch, 9% is Moroccan, 5% is Turkish, 3% Surinamese and 15% of other ethnicities. Utrecht is expected to have 340,000 inhabitants in 2020. Inhabitants of Utrecht are called Utrechter or more rarely Utrechtenaar.The term Utrechtenaar has become a profane expression for homosexual after the 1730-31 sodomy trials, and has fallen into disuse since. This distinction, however, is not always known by Dutch speakers from outside the region, who may use the term Utrechtenaar without being aware of the specific connotation. Vleuten-De Meern was a separate municipality until 2001, which included the villages of Haarzuilens and Veldhuizen. Population data are of Jan 1 2007.   Utrecht is famous for the Dom Tower of Utrecht, belonging to the former cathedral (Dom Church), and for the canal structure in the inner city. The inner city has largely retained its Medieval structure. Due to the importance of Utrecht as a religious centre in the past, several monumental churches have survived, such as the romanesque St Peter's and St John's churches, and the gothic churches of St Jacob and St Nicholas, and the so-called Buurkerk, now converted into a museum. The city also has a minor skyline, dominated by the Dom tower, which will be expanded in the next couple of years. The second highest building of the city, the 'Rabobanktoren', will be completed in 2010 and will stand 105m tall. Two antennas will increase that height to 120m. Two other buildings are currently under construction around the 'Nieuw Galgenwaard' stadium. These buildings, the 'Kantoortoren Galghenwert' and 'Apollo Residence', will be completed in 2007 and will stand 85,5 and 64,5 metres high respectively. Finally, there are somewhat controversial plans for a 262 m high skyscraper in the newly built neighbourhood of Leidsche Rijn: the 'Belle van Zuylen'. Because of its central location, the City of Utrecht is well connected to the rest of the Netherlands, and has a well-developed public transport network.  Utrecht Centraal railway station (NS abbreviation: ut) is a main node of the Dutch railway network. The station is served by: There are also four minor railway stations in Utrecht: Utrecht Overvecht (uto), Utrecht Lunetten (utl), Utrecht Terwijde (utt), and Utrecht Zuilen (utzl). Additionally, some new railway stations are planned for the Randstadspoor project. Special train services operate to the former Maliebaan station, which is now home to the Dutch railroad museum. A light-rail (sneltram in Dutch) line runs from the Utrecht Centraal station, through the neighbourhoods of  and  to Nieuwegein and IJsselstein. This line is operated by Connexxion. Besides being an important node in the transportation system Utrecht hosts the headquarters of both the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railroads), the most important train company in the Netherlands, and ProRail, the state owned company that is responsible for building and maintenance of railroad tracks throughout the Netherlands. Utrecht Central railway station also operates as the main local and regional bus station. The bus network of Utrecht includes The Utrecht Central railway station is also frequented by the pan-European Eurolines bus company and acts as the departure and arrival place of many bus trips to holiday resorts in Spain and France and during winter in Austria and Switzerland. Utrecht is well connected to the main roads in the Netherlands. Two of the most important major roads cross near Utrecht: The A12 [The Hague - Germany] and the A2 [Amsterdam - Maastricht]. Other roads are the A27 [Almere - Bavel] and the A28 [Utrecht - Groningen]. Due to the increasing traffic, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht. Utrecht also has a medium-sized industrial port, located on the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal, which is connected to the Rhine river. The CTU container terminal has a capacity of 80,000 containers a year. In 2003, the port facilitated the transport of four million tons of cargo; mostly sand, gravel, fertilizer, and fodder. Additionally some touristic boat trips are organised from various places on the Oudegracht. The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city. Production industry has a relatively small influence in Utrecht. Rabobank a large bank has its headquarters in Utrecht. Utrecht is the center of the Dutch railroad network and the location of the head office of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways). NS's former head office 'De Inktpot' in Utrecht is the largest brick building in the Netherlands (the "UFO" gracing its facade stems from an art program in 2000). The building is currently used by ProRail. A large indoor shopping center called  is located between the central railway station and the city center. The corridors have been considered public places like streets, and the main route from station to city center is therefore open all night. Over the next 20 years (counting from 2004), parts of Hoog Catharijne will disappear as a consequence of the renovation of the Station-area[ ]. Parts of the city's network of canals, which were filled to create the shopping center and central station area, will be recreated. At the west side of the central railway station can be found the Jaarbeurs, one of the largest convention centers of the Netherlands.  Utrecht University, the largest university of The Netherlands (26,787 students as of 2004), is based in the inner city and in the Uithof campus area, on the east of the city. It's the 42nd best university in the world, according to Shanghai Jiaotong University's university ranking in 2007. Utrecht also houses the much smaller University of Humanistics (estimated at a few hundred students). Utrecht is home of one of the locations of TiasNimbas, focused on post-experience management education and the largest management school of its kind in The Netherlands. In 2007, its executive MBA program was rated the 11th best progam in the world by the Financial Times. Utrecht is also home to two other large institutions of higher education: the Hogeschool Utrecht (30,000 students), the HKU Utrecht School of the Arts (3,000 students). Utrecht city has an active cultural life, in the Netherlands second only to Amsterdam. There are several theatres and theatre companies. It hosts an important classical music centre Vredenburg and the rock club Tivoli. Training of young musicians is taking place in the conservatory (a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts). There is a specialised museum of automatically playing musical instruments. There are a large number of cinemas including three arthouse cinemas. Utrecht is host to the Netherlands Film Festival.  There are many art galleries in Utrecht. There are also several foundations to support art, and artists. Training of artists is done at the Utrecht School of the Arts, and there are many initiatives for amateur artists. The Centraal Museum has many exhibitions on the arts, including a permanent exhibition on the works of Utrecht resident illustrator Dick Bruna, who is best known for creating Miffy. Utrecht also houses one of the landmarks of modern architecture, the 1924 Rietveld Schröder House, which is listed on UNESCO's world heritage sites. To involve the city population as a whole (rather than the elite alone) in the cultural riches of the city, Utrecht city, in collaboration with the different cultural organisations, regularly organise cultural Sundays. During a thematic Sunday several organisations create a program, which is open to everyone without, or with a very much reduced, admission fee. Utrecht is home to the FC Utrecht football club, which plays in Stadium Nieuw Galgenwaard. It is also the home of the largest sportsclub of The Netherlands (4.500 members), SV Kampong. Kampong features fieldhockey, soccer, cricket, tennis, squash and jeu de boules. Kampong's men and women top hockey squads play in the highest dutch hockey league, the Rabohoofdklasse.
