   Baltimore (pronounced ) is an independent city and the largest city in the state of Maryland in the United States.  As of 2006, the population of Baltimore City was 640,961. The city is a major U.S. seaport, situated closer to major Midwestern markets than any other major seaport on the East Coast. Once an industrial town with an economic base in manufacturing, Baltimore's economy has shifted primarily to a service sector-oriented, with the largest employer no longer Bethlehem Steel but The Johns Hopkins University and The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Baltimore Metropolitan Area, which includes the city's surrounding suburbs, has approximately 2.6 million residents. Baltimore is also part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area (CMSA) of approximately 8.1 million residents.  Baltimore's metropolitan area is the 20th largest in the country. The city is named after the founding proprietor of the Maryland Colony, Lord Baltimore in the Irish House of Lords. Baltimore himself took his title from a place named Baltimore in Ireland, which is an Anglicized form of the Irish language Baile an Tí Mhoir.Placenames. Northern Ireland. Genealogy.

Baltimore in County Cork was the seat of Lord Baltimore.http://pages.baltimorecountymd.com/history.htm History of Baltimore County] Baltimore became the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States during the 1800s. Because there is also a Baltimore County surrounding (but not including) the city, it is sometimes referred to as Baltimore City when a clear distinction is desired.       During the 17th century, various towns called "Baltimore" were founded as commercial ports at various locations on the upper Chesapeake Bay.  The Maryland colonial General Assembly created the port (at Locust Point) in 1706 as a tobacco port of entry. The present city dates from July 30, 1729, and is named after Cæcilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore, who was the first Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland.  Like many early U.S. cities, this name came from a place in Europe. Cæcilius Calvert was a son of George Calvert who was awarded the Barony of Baltimore in County Cork Ireland in 1625 by King James I of England. George Calvert hence became the first Lord Baltimore. Baltimore grew swiftly in the mid- to late 18th century as a granary for sugar-producing colonies in the Caribbean.  The profit from sugar encouraged the cultivation of cane and the importation of food.  Baltimore's shorter distance from the Caribbean, compared to other large port cities such as New York City and Boston, reduced transportation time and minimized the spoilage of flour. Baltimore played a key part in events leading to and including the American Revolution.  City leaders such as Jonathan Plowman Jr. moved the city to join the resistance to British taxation.  Baltimore joined other cities in protesting Boston's punishment by the British by banding together the merchants to sign agreements to not import from or export to Britain.  Dr. John Stevenson and Jonathan Plowman Jr. made Baltimore a center for importation of indentured servants from England during the 1750s and 60's.  Baltimore in 1773 was also the place where Customs officer Robert Moreton was chased out of town for trying to seize the ship Speedwell and its cargo.  The story is that Mr. Moreton had ordered the captain to wait on offloading till after he came back.  The merchants demanded their cargo and started off loading.  When Mr. Moreton returned he declared the ship seized and went to Annapolis to file the paperwork.  Upon his return the local merchants chased him and tarred and feathered two men who worked for him.  Fearing for his life he first fled to Annapolis and later to Boston. During the War of 1812, the British declared Baltimore a "nest of Pirates.""The Chesapeake Campaign". Pride of Baltimore II. Baltimore Clipper History. URL retrieved on January 27, 2007.  The city's Fort McHenry came under attack by British forces near the harbor after the British had burned Washington, D.C. Known today as the Battle of Baltimore, American forces won by repulsing joint land and naval attacks. In the years that followed, Baltimore's population grew explosively, due to increased commerce not only abroad but more importantly with points west in the interior of the United States.  The construction of the federally funded National Road (a route now followed by U.S. Route 40) and the privately funded Baltimore & Ohio Railroad made Baltimore a major shipping and manufacturing center.  As fortunes were made, the city's distinctive local culture started taking shape, and it started to develop a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments.  On an 1827 visit to the city, John Quincy Adams purportedly nicknamed it "Monument City"--a moniker that remained popular for well over a century. Baltimore became an independent city in 1851, being separated from Baltimore County at that time. Though it was a slave-holding state, Maryland did not secede but remained part of the Union during the Civil War. Slavery was outlawed in Maryland by the state Constitution of 1864. Secessionist sentiment led to the Baltimore riot of 1861, when Union soldiers marched through the city. After the riot, Union troops occupied Baltimore, and Maryland came under direct federal administration &mdash; in part, to prevent the state from seceding &mdash; until the end of the war in April 1865. This was considered a necessary move by the Union to prevent Washington, D.C., from being completely surrounded by seceded Confederate territory. The case Ex parte Merryman, written by Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney (himself a Marylander), dealt with the habeas corpus rights of Marylanders jailed by the Abraham Lincoln Administration and strongly rebuked Lincoln for his actions. The Great Baltimore Fire on February 7, 1904, destroyed over 1,500 buildings in 30 hours and forced most of the city to rebuild.  Immediately afterward, Mayor Robert McLane was quoted in the Baltimore News-Post newspaper as saying, "To suppose that the spirit of our people will not rise to the occasion is to suppose that our people are not genuine Americans.  We shall make the fire of 1904 a landmark not of decline but of progress." He then refused assistance, stating "As head of this municipality, I cannot help but feel gratified by the sympathy and the offers of practical assistance which have been tendered to us.  To them I have in general terms replied, 'Baltimore will take care of its own, thank you.'" (McLane committed suicide on May 30.) Two years later, on September 10, 1906, the Baltimore American newspaper reported that the city had risen from the ashes and "one of the great disasters of modern time had been converted into a blessing." Baltimore's population peaked at 949,708 in the 1950 Census, which ranked it as the sixth-largest city in the country, behind Detroit, and ahead of Cleveland.  For the next five decades, the city's population declined while its suburbs grew dramatically, bottoming out in 2000 at 636,251.  In the 21st century, the city's population has stabilized and is again rising, mostly due to revitalization efforts in many city neighborhoods.  The mid-July 2006 Census estimate was 640,961. Sparked by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in Memphis, Tennessee on Thursday, April 4, 1968, the Baltimore Riot of 1968 did not end until Friday, April 12, 1968. Coinciding with riots in other cities, the Baltimore riot yielded an estimated fourth of riot-related arrests nationwide and cost the city of Baltimore an estimated $8-$10 million. Maryland National Guard troops were stationed and 1,900 federal troops were ordered into the city. Lasting effects of the riot can be seen on the streets of North Avenue, Howard Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue where long stretches of the streets are barren of business. (A tie-in to this story is that Dr. King was scheduled to speak in Baltimore in March of 1968 but instead went to Memphis, Tennessee to join the sanitation worker strike.)Baltimore Riots of 1968: A Timeline, University of Baltimore In recent years, efforts to redevelop the downtown area have led to a revitalization of the Inner Harbor. Up until the late 1970s, the harbor had been merely abandoned warehouses full of rats and rotting piers. In Baltimore's early days, the harbor was the landing destination for boats and ships bringing cargo such as bananas, sugar, cocoa, and the like from all over the world. The Baltimore Convention Center was opened in 1979 and was renovated and expanded in 1996.  Harborplace, a modern urban retail and restaurant complex, was opened on the waterfront in 1980, followed by the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland's largest tourist destination, and another cultural venue, the Baltimore Museum of Industry in 1981. In 1992, the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball moved from Memorial Stadium to Oriole Park at Camden Yards downtown, and six years later the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League moved next door into PSINet Stadium (later renamed M&T Bank Stadium following PSINet's bankruptcy). On October 2, 1996, Baltimore became the first city in the United States to adopt 311 as a non-emergency "hot line" telephone number, in order to reserve the use of 911 for genuine emergencies. The concept has been highly successful, and numerous other American municipalities have since implemented the practice.  In 2003, the Baltimore Development Corporation announced that three hotel projects were being reviewed. As of September 2006, the 756-room, $305 million Hilton hotel project is currently under construction west of the Baltimore Convention Center. The City of Baltimore hopes to have it finished and opened by August 2008. (See Baltimore Convention Center Hotel Project for more details regarding the convention center hotel.) Also in 2003, on September 18, Baltimore was affected by Hurricane Isabel from flooding as a result of tidal surge, affecting primarily the Fells Point community and the Inner Harbor and surrounding low areas. Many places were flooded, including the sports center ESPN Zone, the Baltimore World Trade Center (which remained closed for approximately a month during cleanup efforts), and most of the Inner Harbor. Water levels rose some 20&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(6&nbsp;m) in areas, flooding underground parking garages and displacing thousands of cubic yards of trash and debris. Beginning in the early part of the 21st century, Baltimore has undergone a major building spree in the downtown area, specifically in the Inner Harbor East district.  The skyline has extended and will continue to do so well into the next decade.

Formerly the president of the Baltimore City Council, Dixon became mayor when former Mayor Martin O'Malley resigned to become Governor of Maryland.  Dixon was elected to a full term in November of 2007. Baltimore is in the north central part of the state of Maryland, on the Patapsco River, 40&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(60&nbsp;km) northeast of Washington DC, very close to the Chesapeake Bay.  The fall line, where the Piedmont Plateau meets the Atlantic Coastal Plain, cuts through the western portion of the city, dividing Baltimore into "lower city" and "upper city."  Baltimore's City Hall lies approximately 34&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(10.4&nbsp;m) above sea level, with elevations in the city ranging from sea level to  in the northwest corner. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 92.1&nbsp;square miles (238.5&nbsp;km²), of which, 80.8&nbsp;square miles (209.3&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 11.3&nbsp;square miles (29.2&nbsp;km²) of it is water. The total area is 12.240 percent water. Baltimore's climate, with plentiful precipitation and a relatively long growing season, supports the presence of many different types of trees.  Many species of trees thrive here and can be spotted throughout the city, including white oak, elm, maple, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), southern live oak, bradford pear, poplar, southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), several species of Hardy palms and crepe myrtle.  The city lies mostly in Plant Hardiness Zone 8, with a small portion of the northern and western city in zone 7. The average date of first freeze in Baltimore is November 13, and the average last freeze is April 2. The Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area is the 4th largest Combined Statistical Area in the United States, with an estimated population of 8,052,496. The Baltimore-Towson Metropolitan Statistical Area is the 19th largest MSA, with a population of 2,655,675. &nbsp; Baltimore lies within the humid subtropical climate zone (Cfa), according to the Köppen classification. The weather is moderated by the city's relative proximity to the ocean. The city gets relatively hot, humid summers and cool, moist winters. July is typically the hottest month of the year, with an average high temperature of 91 °F (32 °C) and an average low of 73 °F (22 °C).  Summer is also a season of very high humidity in the Baltimore area, with afternoon thunderstorms occurring regularly. The record high for Baltimore is 108 °F (42 °C), set in 1985. January is the coldest month, with an average high of 44 °F (6 °C) and an average low of 29 °F (-1 °C). However, winter warm fronts can bring periods of springlike weather, and Arctic fronts can drop nighttime low temperatures into the teens. The record low temperature for Baltimore is -7 °F (-22 °C), set in 1934. Baltimore rarely experiences temperatures below  or above . Due to an urban heat island effect in the city proper and a moderating effect of the Chesapeake Bay, the outlying, inland, and higher elevation parts of the Baltimore metro area are usually several degrees cooler than the city proper and the coastal towns. As is typical in most East Coast cities, precipitation is generous, and very evenly spread throughout the year. Every month usually brings 3-4 inches of precipitation, averaging around  annually.  Spring, summer, and fall bring frequent showers and thunderstorms, with an average of 105 sunny days a year. Winter often brings lighter rain showers of longer duration, and generally less sunshine and more clouds. Snowfall can occur occasionally in the winter, with the average annual snowfall around 21 inches (53 cm).  Baltimore averages only 2-3 snow events per year   In the northern and western suburbs, the climate begins to transition to continental, and thus winter snowfall amounts are usually higher, with some towns annually receiving 24-36 inches (61-91 cm).NOAA,  Freezing rain and sleet occurs a few times each winter in Baltimore, as warm air over rides cold air at the upper levels of the atmosphere. The cold air gets trapped against the mountains to the west and the result is freezing rain and or sleet. The city lies in between two peculiar physical features that protect it from extreme weather and account for the relatively tempered seasons.  The Appalachian Mountains protect central Maryland from much of the harsh northern winds and accompanying lake effect weather that bring subfreezing temperatures and heavy snows to the Great Lakes region, and the Delmarva Peninsula protects Baltimore from many of the tropical storms that affect the immediate coast. ::::Average Monthly Temperatures and Precipitation for Baltimore, MD Source: The Weather Channel   Baltimore exhibits examples from each period of architecture over more than two centuries, and work from many famous architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, John Russell Pope, Mies Van Der Rohe and I.M. Pei. The city has architecturally important buildings in a variety of styles. The Baltimore Basilica (1806-1821) is a neoclassical design by Benjamin Latrobe, and also the oldest Catholic Cathedral in the United States. In 1813 Robert Cary Long, Sr. built for Rembrandt Peale the first substantial structure in the United States designed expressly as a museum. Restored, it is now the Municipal Museum of Baltimore, or popularly the “Peale Museum”. The McKim Free School founded and endowed by John McKim, although the building was erected by his son Isaac in 1822 after a design by William Howard and William Small. It reflects the popular interest in Greece when the nation was securing its independence, as well as a scholarly interest in recently published drawings of Athenian antiquities. The Phoenix Shot Tower (1828), at 215&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(65.5&nbsp;m) tall, was the tallest building in the United States until the time of the Civil war. It was constructed without the use of exterior scaffolding.  The Sun Iron Building designed by R.C. Hatfield in 1851, was city’s first iron-front building and it was a model for a whole generation of downtown buildings. The Johns Hopkins Hospital, designed by Lt. Col. John S. Billings in 1876 was a considerable achievement for its day in functional arrangement and fire proofing. I.M.Pei's World Trade Center (1977) is the tallest equilateral pentagonal building in the world at 405&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(123.4&nbsp;m) tall. Future contributions to Baltimore's skyline include plans for a 717&nbsp;foot&nbsp;(218.5&nbsp;m) tall structure known as "10 Inner Harbor". The building was recently approved by Baltimore's design panel and will be completed around the year 2010. It will include luxury condominiums, a hotel, restaurants, and shopping centers.  The Naing Corporation has approved a tower of 50-60 floors for the lot at 300 Pratt street, with the design currently being finalized.  The Inner Harbor East area will see the addition of two new towers which have started construction:  a 24-floor tower that will be the new world headquarters of Legg Mason, and a 44-floor Four Seasons Hotel complex. The streets of Baltimore are organized in a grid pattern. The streets are lined with tens of thousands of brick and Formstone faced rowhouses. Many consider the rowhouse the architectural form most closely associated to the city. Some rowhouses are dated as far back as the 1790s. Oriole Park at Camden Yards is considered by many to be the most beautiful ball park in Major League Baseball, and has inspired many other cities to build their own versions of this Retro-Style Ballpark. Camden Yards along with the National Aquarium have helped revive the Inner Harbor from what once was an Industrial zone full of dilapidated warehouses, into a bustling commercial district full of bars, restaurants and retail establishments. Tallest Buildings in Baltimore Baltimore is officially divided into nine geographical regions: Northern, Northwestern, Northeastern, Western, Central, Eastern, Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern, with each patrolled by a respective Baltimore Police Department district. However, it is not uncommon for locals to divide the city simply by East or West Baltimore, using Charles Street or I-83 as a dividing line, and/or into North and South using Baltimore Street as a dividing line. The Central region of the city is the Downtown area and location of Baltimore's main commercial area. Home to Harborplace, The Camden Yards Sports Complex (Oriole Park at Camden Yards and M&T Bank Stadium), the Convention Center, and the National Aquarium in Baltimore, the area also includes many nightclubs bars and restaurants, shopping centers and various other attractions. It is also serves as the home to many of Baltimore's key business such as Legg Mason and Constellation Energy. In addition, the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus is housed in this area, with the long-associated University of Maryland Medical Center adjacent to the school. The area, especially in the downtown core, has mainly served as a commercial district with limited residential opportunities. However since 2002 the population in the downtown has doubled to 10,000 residents with a projection of 7,400 additional housing units coming available by 2012.Mirabella, Lorraine. "Downtown jobs, housing boom", The Baltimore Sun,  January 30, 2007 The Northern region of the city lies directly north of downtown and is bounded on the East by The Alameda and on the West by Pimlico Road is a suburban residential area home to many of the city's upper class residents in neighborhoods such as the Roland Park-Homewood-Guilford area. The Northern region is home to many of Baltimore's notable universities such as Loyola College and The Johns Hopkins University. The Southern Region of the city, a mixed industrial and residential area, consists of the area of the city below the Inner Harbor east of the B&O railroad tracks. It is a mixed socio-economic region consisting of working class ethnically mixed neighborhoods such as Locust Point; the recently gentrified Federal Hill and Canton areas, home to many working professionals, pubs and restaurants; and low-income residential areas such as Cherry Hill. The Eastern part of the city consists of the Northeastern, Eastern, and Southeastern regions of the city. Northeastern Baltimore is primarily a residential neighborhood home to Morgan State University bounded by the city line on its Northern and Eastern boundaries, Sinclair Lane, Erdman Avenue, and Pulaski Highway on its southern boundaries and The Alameda on its western boundaries. It has undergone demographic shifts over many years and remains a diverse but predominantly African American region of the city. The Eastern region is the heart of what is considered "East Baltimore" and is home to Johns Hopkins Hospital. Located below Erdman Avenue and Sinclair Lane above Orleans Street, it is almost an exclusively African American area home to low-income residential neighborhoods, several of which constitute many of Baltimore's high crime areas. The Southeastern region of the city is located below Orleans Street bordering the Inner Harbor on its western boundary,the city line on its eastern boundaries and the Baltimore harbor on its southern boundaries is a mixed industrial and residential area. Home to many young professionals and working class people, It is an ethnically rich section of Baltimore home to many Polish Americans, Greek Americans, Italian Americans, African Americans and is also the center of the city's steadily growing Hispanic population. The Western part of the city consists of the Northwestern, Western, and Southwestern regions of Baltimore. The Northwestern region of the city bounded by the county line on its northern and western boundaries, Gwynns Falls Parkway on the south and Pimlico Road on the East is a predominantly residential area home to Pimlico Race Course, Sinai Hospital and several of Baltimore's Synagogues. Once the center of Baltimore's Jewish community, it has undergone white flight since the 1960s and has became an almost exclusively African American area. It is home to many suburban residential areas primarily located above Northern Parkway and several lower-income areas below Northern parkway. The Western region of the city located west of downtown is the heart of "West Baltimore" bounded by Gwynns Falls Parkway, Fremont Avenue, and Baltimore Street. Home to Coppin State University and Pennsylvania Avenue, it has been the center of Baltimore's African American culture for years home to many of the city's historical African American neighborhoods and landmarks. Once home to many middle to upper class African Americans, over the years, the more affluent African American residents have since left migrating to other sections of the city in addition to areas such as Randallstown and Owings Mills in Baltimore County and Columbia in Howard County. The area now constitutes a deprived socio-economic group of African American residents and like "East Baltimore", it is known for its high crime rates. Many of the television series concerning Baltimore's crime problems have been based upon events that have taken place in West Baltimore. The Southwestern region of the city is bounded by Baltimore County to the west, Baltimore Street to the north, and downtown and the B&O railroad to the east. A mixed industrial and residential area, it has gradually shifted from having a predominantly White to a predominantly African American majority. The City of Baltimore is bordered by the following communities, all unincorporated census-designated places. All are in adjacent Baltimore County, except Brooklyn Park and Glen Burnie, which are in adjacent Anne Arundel County. In addition, the southern part of the city is bordered by another unincorporated part of northeastern Anne Arundel County.  Historically a working-class port town, Baltimore has sometimes been dubbed a "city of neighborhoods," with over 300 identified districts traditionally occupied by distinct ethnic groups.  Most notable today are three downtown areas along the port: the Inner Harbor, frequented by tourists due to its hotels, shops, and museums; Fells Point, once a favorite entertainment spot for sailors but now refurbished and gentrified (and featured in the movie Sleepless in Seattle); and Little Italy, located between the other two, where Baltimore's Italian-American community was based&ndash;and where current U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi grew up.  Further inland, Mt. Vernon is the traditional center of cultural and artistic life of the city; it is home to a distinctive Washington Monument, set atop a hill in a 19th century urban square, that predates the more well-known monument in Washington, D.C. by several decades. The traditional local accent has long been noted and celebrated as "Baltimorese" or "Bawlmorese."  One thing outsiders quickly notice is that the locals refer to their city as "Bawlmer" or "Ballmer," dropping with the "t" for the most part.  The dialect is similar to that of many Marylanders, Virginians and Pennsylvanians; it may reflect the region's roots in Cornwall and the English West Country, as many of the original settlers of the Chesapeake Bay area came from this area in colonial times.  (Traditionally, many Marylanders call their state "Merlin"--and likewise, many Pennsylvanians call their state "Pennsavania," dropping the "l".)  However, Baltimore's local accent also reflects the rich mix of ethnic groups from Ireland, Germany, and southern and eastern Europe who immigrated to the city during the industrial era. More recently, local pronunciations of "Baldamore" or "Ballmore" have become common. As Baltimore's demographics have changed since World War Two, its cultural flavor and accents have evolved as well.  Today, after decades of out-migration to suburbs beyond its corporate limits and significant in-migration of black Americans from Georgia and the Carolinas, Baltimore has become a majority black city with a significantly changed, but still regionally distinctive, dialect and culture. Recently, neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and Canton have undergone extensive gentrification and have proven to be popular places for young professionals and college students to reside. In addition, Latinos are making their mark, notably in neighborhoods near Fells Point. Much of Baltimore's black American culture has roots that long predate the 20th century "Great Migration" from the Deep South.  Like Atlanta, Georgia and Washington, D.C., Baltimore has been home to a successful black middle class and professional community for centuries.  Before the Civil War, Baltimore had one of the largest concentrations of free black Americans among American cities.  In the twentieth century, Baltimore-born Thurgood Marshall became the first black American justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Baltimore's culture has been famously celebrated in the films of Barry Levinson, who grew up in the city's Jewish neighborhoods.  His movies Diner, Tin Men, Avalon, and Liberty Heights are inspired to varying degrees by his life in the city. Baltimore native John Waters parodies the city extensively in his films, including the 1972 cult classic Pink Flamingos. His film Hairspray and its Broadway musical remake are also set in Baltimore. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra is an internationally-renowned orchestra, founded in 1916 as a publicly-funded municipal organization. The current Music Director is Marin Alsop, a protégé of Leonard Bernstein. Center Stage is the premier theater company in the city and a regionally well-respected group. The Baltimore Opera is an important regional opera company, and The Baltimore Consort has been a leading early music ensemble for over twenty-five years.  The France-Merrick Performing Arts Center, home of the restored Thomas W. Lamb-designed Hippodrome Theatre, has afforded Baltimore the opportunity to become a major regional player in the area of touring Broadway and other performing arts presentations. Baltimore also boasts a wide array of professional (non-touring) and community theater groups.  Aside from Center Stage, resident troupes in the city include Everyman Theatre and Baltimore Theatre Festival. Community theaters in the city include Fells Point Community Theatre and the Arena Players, which is the nation's oldest continuously operating African American community theater.[ ]  Once an industrial town, with an economic base focused on steel processing, shipping, auto manufacturing, and transportation, Baltimore is now a modern service economy.  Although deindustrialization took its toll on the city, costing residents many low-skill, high-wage jobs, the city is a growing financial, business, and health service base for the southern Mid-Atlantic region. The city is home to only one Fortune 500 Company, Constellation Energy, and its suburbs are home to two more--Grace Chemicals, in Columbia, and Black & Decker in Towson.  However, many other companies call Baltimore home, including asset manager Legg Mason, investment advisories T. Rowe Price and Brown Advisory, Alex Brown, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank (of Baltimore origin, and at the time of its acquisition, the oldest continuously-running investment bank in the United States), FTI Consulting, Vertis, Thomson Prometric, Performax, Sylvan Learning/Laureate Education, Under Armour, DAP, 180°, Old Mutual Financial Network, and Advertising.com.  Spice giant McCormick & Company was founded in Baltimore, and is currently headquartered in suburban Hunt Valley. The city is also home to the Johns Hopkins Hospital, which will serve as the center of a new biotechnology park.  The park, one of two such projects currently under construction in the city, will provide room for medical/technology upstarts as well as industry giants to tap into the wealth of knowledge in Baltimore.  Baltimore is widely regarded as one of the world's most important depositories of medical knowledge. After New York City, Baltimore was the second city in the United States to reach a population of 100,000, (followed by New Orleans, Philadelphia, Boston).United States census data for 1830, 1840, and 1850 In the 1830, 1840, and 1850 censuses of the United States of America, Baltimore was the second-largest city in population, surpassed by Philadelphia in 1860. It was among the top 10 cities in population in the United States in every census up to the 1980 census.  The city and metropolitan area currently rank in the top 20 in terms of population.  In the 1990s, the US Census reported that Baltimore ranked as one of the largest population losers alongside Detroit and Washington D.C., losing over 84,000 residents between 1990 and 2000."Top 50 Cities in the U.S. by Population and Rank (2005 Census)". infoplease.com. 2005. Retrieved August 1 2006 As of 2006, the population was 640,961; however, recent projections show a 0.08 percent increase in the population.  The population in 2020 is projected to be 661,100.  The Baltimore&ndash;Towson metropolitan area, as of 2004, was estimated to have a population of 2.6 million.Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2004 (CBSA-EST2004-01)  The population density was 8,058.4 people per square mile (3,111.5/km²).  There were 300,477 housing units at an average density of 3,718.6/sq&nbsp;mi (1,435.8/km²).  The racial makeup of the city was 64.34% Black or African American, 31.63% White, 0.32% Native American, 1.53% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.67% from other races, and 1.47% from two or more races.  1.70% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. This census, however, does not accurately represent the city's Latino population, which, over the past few years, has been steadily increasing. This growth is mainly seen in the southeastern neighborhoods around Fells Point, Patterson Park, and Highlandtown, and in the city's Northwestern neighborhoods such as Fallstaff, as well as various neighborhoods of Northeastern Baltimore. 6.2% of the population were of German ancestry according to Census 2000. There were 257,996 households, out of which 25.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 26.7% were married couples living together, 25.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.0% were non-families. 34.9% of all households are made up of individuals, and 11.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.42, and the average family size was 3.16.

Baltimore is an independent city &mdash; not part of any county. For most governmental purposes under Maryland law, Baltimore City is treated as a "county"-level entity. The United States Census Bureau uses counties as the basic unit for presentation of statistical information in the United States, and treats Baltimore as a county equivalent for those purposes. Baltimore has been a Democratic stronghold for over 150 years, with Democrats dominating every level of government. For a full list of mayors who served the city, see List of Baltimore Mayors. On November 6, 2007, incumbent Democratic Mayor Sheila Dixon was elected Mayor.  Dixon, as former City Council President, had assumed the office of Mayor on January 17, 2007 when former Mayor Martin O'Malley took office as the Governor of Maryland. Grassroots pressure for reform, voiced as Question P, restructured the city council in November of 2002, against the will of the mayor, the council president, and the majority of the council.  A coalition of union and community groups, organized by ACORN, backed the effort. The Baltimore City Council is now made up of 14 single member districts and one elected at-large council president. Stephanie Rawlings Blake is the council's president and Robert W. Curran is the Vice President. See also: Baltimore City Delegation Prior to 1969, some considered Baltimore and its suburbs to be particularly underrepresented in the Maryland General Assembly, while rural areas were heavily overrepresented.  Since Baker v. Carr in 1962, Baltimore and its suburbs account for a substantial majority of seats in the state legislature; this has caused some to argue that rural areas are now underrepresented. Baltimore's steady loss of population, however, has resulted in a loss of seats in the Maryland General Assembly.  Since 1980, Baltimore has lost four senators from the 47-member Maryland State Senate and twelve delegates from the 141-member Maryland House of Delegates. Three of the state's eight congressional districts include portions of Baltimore: the 2nd, represented by Dutch Ruppersberger; the 3rd, represented by John Sarbanes; and the 7th, represented by Elijah Cummings.  All three are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant portion of Baltimore since 1931 and has not represented any of Baltimore since 2003. Both of Maryland's Senators, Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski, are from Baltimore.  Coincidentally, both represented the 3rd District before being elected to the Senate.  Mikulski represented the 3rd from 1977 to 1987, and was succeeded by Cardin, who held the seat until his election and inauguration to the Senate in 2007.

Though this is significantly lower than the record-high 353 homicides in 1993, the homicide rate in Baltimore is nearly seven times the national rate, six times the rate of New York City, and three times the rate of Los Angeles.  In addition, other categories of crime in Baltimore have also been declining, although overall crime rates are still high compared to the national average. The rate of forcible rapes has fallen below the national average in recent years; however, Baltimore still has much higher-than-average rates of aggravated assault, burglary, robbery, and theft., AreaConnect Though the crime situation in Baltimore is considered one of the worst in the nation, city officials have pointed out that most violent crimes, particularly homicides, are committed by people who know their victims and who are often associated with the illegal drug trade., Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (1998)  City officials have, however, come under scrutiny from Maryland legislators regarding the veracity of crime statistics reported by the Baltimore City Police Department., WBAL-TV (February 14, 2006)  For 2003 the FBI identified irregularities in the number of rapes reported, which was confirmed by the Mayor.  2005's homicide numbers appeared to exhibit discrepancies as well, WBAL-TV (February 14, 2006)  The former Commissioner of Police stated upon interview that the administration suppressed corrections of its reported crime., WBAL-TV (February 22, 2006)  However, many of these charges seem to be, at least partially, politically motivated.John Wagner and Tim Craig, , Washington Post (February 14, 2006)  Nonetheless, experts indicate that the city's reporting practices merit an independent audit, with which the administration has not cooperated, despite requests from members of City Council and the City's auditor., The Associated Press (February 12, 2006)  The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a suit in respect of systematic civil rights abuses by the current administration., The Associated Press (June 15, 2006)  While police officials and their critics disagree about exact figures, it is nonetheless clear that approximately 25% of the roughly 100,000 arrests each year are made in the absence of a chargeable offense. Witness intimidation has also been reported as a problem in the city.Gary Gately, , The Boston Globe (February 12, 2005)  In an infamous case, community activist Angela Dawson and her family were murdered by firebomb in their Baltimore home on October 16, 2002, in retaliation for Dawson's reporting of criminal activity.  In a separate incident in 2005, another public safety activist, Edna McAbier, was also targeted by firebomb. Though she survived, she has fled her neighborhood. Three men were sentenced to life in prison for their involvement in the latter case. In 1988, journalist David Simon spent a year with the homicide unit of the Baltimore City Police Department.  His experiences were chronicled in the critically acclaimed book, Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets.  His nonfiction account was the basis for the TV series Homicide: Life on the Street. Simon is currently the producer of the HBO series The Wire which documents the various intricacies of Baltimore's political, criminal, and educational struggles throughout the past several years. In 2007, there were 282 murders in Baltimore. , Baltimore City Paper (January 3, 2008)  In February of 2008, the Baltimore City Police reported a sharp decline in homicides in Baltimore.

Kennedy Memorial Highway), I-395, I-695 (the Baltimore Beltway), I-795 (the Northwest Expressway), I-895 (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway), and I-97.  Several of the city's interstate highways, e.g. I-95, I-83, and I-70 are not directly connected to each other, and in the case of I-70 end just outside city limits at the Baltimore Beltway, because of freeway revolts in the City of Baltimore.  These revolts were led by Barbara Mikulski, which resulted in the abandonment of the original plan.  U.S. highways and state routes that run to and through downtown Baltimore include U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 40 National Road, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  There are two tunnels traversing the Baltimore harbor within the city limits: the four-bore Fort McHenry Tunnel (served by I-95) and the two-bore Harbor Tunnel (served by I-895).  The Baltimore Beltway crosses south of Baltimore harbor over the Francis Scott Key Bridge.   Baltimore is a top destination for Amtrak along the Northeast Corridor.

After the civil war, a coffee ship was designed here for trade with Brazil. At the end of the nineteenth century, European ship lines had terminals for immigrants. The Baltimore and Ohio railroad made the port a major transshipment point. Currently the port has major roll-on roll-off facilities, as well as bulk facilities, especially steel handling.
