   Los Angeles (;or  in Spanish) is the largest city in the state of California and the second-largest in the United States. Often abbreviated as L.A., it is rated an alpha world city, having an estimated population of 3.8&nbsp;million[ ] and spanning over 469.1 square miles (1,214.9 square kilometers) in Southern California. Additionally, the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area is home to nearly 17,776,000 people who hail from all over the globe and speak more than a hundred different languages. Los Angeles is the seat of Los Angeles County, the most populous and most diverse county in the United States.  Its inhabitants are known as "Angelenos" (). Los Angeles was founded in the year 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve as El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula (The Village of Our Lady, the Queen of the Angels of Porciúncula). It became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its independence from Spain.  In 1848, at the end of the Mexican-American War, Los Angeles and California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thus becoming part of the United States; Mexico retained the territory of Baja California. It was incorporated as a municipality on April 4 1850 — five months before California achieved statehood. Los Angeles is one of the world's most prominent centers of culture, technology, and international trade.  It is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields. The city and its immediate vicinity lead the world in producing popular entertainment — such as motion picture, television, video games and recorded music — which forms the base of Los Angeles' international fame and global status.  The Los Angeles Consular Corps is one of the largest and most important consular communities in the world.    Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva (or Gabrieleños) and Chumash Native American tribes thousands of years ago. The first Europeans arrived in 1542 under João Cabrilho, a Portuguese explorer who claimed the area as the City of God for the Spanish Empire; he continued with his voyage and did not establish a settlement.Willard, C. D., The Herald's History of Los Angeles (Los Angeles: Kingsley-Barnes, 1901): 22. The next contact would not come until 227 years later, when Gaspar de Portola, together with Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí, reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2 1769. Crespi noted that the site had the potential to be developed into a large settlement.Father Crespi in Los Angeles In 1771, Franciscan friar Junípero Serra built the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel near Whittier Narrows, in what is now called San Gabriel Valley. After a 1776 flood, the mission was moved to its present site in San Gabriel In 1777, the new governor of California, Felipe de Neve, recommended to the viceroy of New Spain that the site noted by Juan Crespi be developed into a pueblo. The town was founded on September 4, 1781, by a group of 44 settlers and was named "El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río de Porciúncula" ("The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels on the River Porciúncula").The History of Los Angeles County These settlers were of Filipino, Native American, African, and Spanish ancestry, with two-thirds being mestizo or mulatto.  A majority of the settlers had some African ancestry."Colonial records indicate that twenty-six of the forty-six original settlers of Los Angeles were of African or part-African ancestry." Mulroy, Kevin, et. al, eds, Seeking El Dorado:African Americans in California (Los Angeles: Autry Museum of Western Heritage, 2001): 79. The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820 the population had increased to about 650 residents.Los Angeles Historical Chronology Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.Acuna, Rodolfo, Anything But Mexican: Chicanos in Contemporary Los Angeles (New York: Version, 1996): 22. New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. Mexican rule ended during the Mexican-American War: Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating on on January 13, 1847, with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga. Later, with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the Mexican government formally ceded Alta California and other territories to the United States. Railroads arrived when the Southern Pacific completed its line to Los Angeles in 1876.Mulholland, Catherine, William Mulholland and the Rise of Los Angeles (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000): 15. Oil was discovered in 1892, and by 1923 Los Angeles was producing one-quarter of the world's petroleum.The Story of Oil in California By 1900, the population had grown to more than 100,000 people,Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1900 putting pressure on the city's water supply.The Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Owens and Mono Lakes (MONO Case) 1913's completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, under the supervision of William Mulholland, assured the continued growth of the city. In 1915, Los Angeles began the annexation of dozens of neighboring communities without water supplies of their own. In the 1920s, the motion picture and aviation industries flocked to Los Angeles. In 1932, with population surpassing one million,Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1930 the city hosted the Summer Olympics. This period also saw the arrival of exiles from the increasing pre-war tensions of Europe, including Thomas Mann, Fritz Lang, Bertolt Brecht, Arnold Schoenberg, and Lion Feuchtwanger. World War II and the expansion of defense industries brought new growth and prosperity to the city.  Thousands of African Americans migrated from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi to work in these expanding fields. The state also succumbed to war fears, transporting most Japanese American residents from Los Angeles and other cities to distant internment camps for the duration of the war. The post-war years saw an even greater boom, as urban sprawl expanded the city into the San Fernando Valley.Bruegmann, Robert, Sprawl: A Compact History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005): 133. In 1969, Los Angeles became one of the birthplaces of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from UCLA to SRI in Menlo Park.Was L.A. really Internet's ground zero? As in other major cities, long-unresolved racial problems erupted in the 1960s and 1970s.  Los Angeles grappled with the Watts Riots in 1965, the high school walkout by Chicano students in 1968, and the 1970 Chicano Moratorium, all representative of racial strife within the city. Los Angeles was one of the cities to pass gay rights bills during the 1970s (in 1979 after years of pressure from prominent performing arts members), and the first city where AIDS was discovered and focused upon during the 1980s. Also in the 1980s, Los Angeles became the center of the heavy metal music scene, especially glam metal bands. In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. It become the most financially successful Olympics in history, and only the second Olympics to turn a profits — the other being the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles. During the remainder of the 1980s, Los Angeles was plagued by increasing gang violence and police corruption. Racial tensions erupted again in 1991 with the Rodney King controversy and the large-scale riots that followed the acquittal of his police attackers. In 1994, the 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. Reich, Kenneth, "Study Raises Northridge Quake Death Toll to 72," Los Angeles Times 20 December 1995: B1. Voters defeated efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city in 2002.City of Los Angeles Secession Votes - 2002  In the early 2000's, the Los Angeles City Council adopted the idea of smart growth, in part to combat both growing traffic problems and the lack of open land for development.  Restrictions on parking for new development, residential conversions, and the hotel bed tax have been greatly eased to encourage development.  This has lead to thousands of residential unit conversions in downtown Los Angeles, and major new construction such as the Hollywood and Highland complex, LA Live Entertainment District, the Grand Avenue Project, the NBC Universal West Coast headquarters complex, and many new high-rise buildings throughout the city, in what is being termed as "Manhattanization." Gentrification and urban redevelopment have occurred in many parts of the city, most notably Hollywood, Koreatown, Silverlake, Echo Park and Downtown.Welcome to Gentrification City Gentrification has recently spilled into the eastern and southern portions of Los Angeles, with announcements of several billion-dollar residential high-rise and commercial center projects. Los Angeles is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of 498.3 square miles (1,290.6 km²), comprising 469.1 square miles (1,214.9 km²) of land and 29.2 square miles (75.7 km²) of water. This makes it the 14th largest city in land area in the United States.Top 100 Cities with Largest Land Area The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) longitudinally and for 29 miles (47 km) latitudinally. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km). It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range. The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak. Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft (1,548 m). The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal. The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean. Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year.Earthquake Facts One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault. Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake.San Andreas Fault Set for the Big One Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt.Earthquake Facts Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960.May 22, 1960 Tsunami from NOAA The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or Dry-Summer Subtropical zone (Köppen climate classification Csb on the coast, Csa inland), USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers. The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected. The average annual temperature is 18.86°C (around 66 °F)GISS average temperature data, GHCN Climate averages 1971 - 2000, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town. Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F (10°C) warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities. A few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing. Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year. When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom.May Gray / June Gloom Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C), but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82&nbsp;°F (27&nbsp;°C), with overnight lows of 63&nbsp;°F (17&nbsp;°C). Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65&nbsp;°F (18&nbsp;°C), on average, with overnight lows of 48&nbsp;°F (10&nbsp;°C) and during this season rain is common. The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September. This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north. The median temperature in January is 57&nbsp;°F (13&nbsp;°C) and 73&nbsp;°F (22&nbsp;°C) in August. The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119.0&nbsp;°F (48.33&nbsp;°C) in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006;Pool, Bob. "In Woodland Hills, It's Just Too Darn Hot." Los Angeles Times July 26, 2006, B1. the lowest temperature recorded was 18.0&nbsp;°F (−7.8&nbsp;°C) in 1989, in Canoga Park. The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112.0&nbsp;°F (44.4&nbsp;°C) on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28.0&nbsp;°F (−2.0&nbsp;°C) on January 4 1949.National Weather Service website Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months (February being the wettest month), with great annual variations in storm severity. Los Angeles averages 15 inches (385 mm) of precipitation per year. Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches. Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches (5 cm) on January 15, 1932.Burt, Christopher. Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book. New York: Norton, 2004: 100.  The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral. Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise,  Strelitzia reginae.San Diego Zoo Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.How Smog Forms in Los Angeles Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (381&nbsp;mm) of rain each year.  Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days.  Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act.  More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles. Driveclean from the California Government web site As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades. The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.People at Risk In 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-Term Particle Pollution. American Lung Association. Retrieved on January 5, 2007.People at Risk In 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Year-Round Particle Pollution. American Lung Association. Retrieved on January 5, 2007. In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel. With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take steps to improve air and water conditions.Lopez, Theresa Adams. "." Port of Los Angeles (News Release). February 17, 2006.Staff Writer. "Air Quality Protections Take Off." Environmental Defense. December 6, 2004.   The city is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns that were annexed by the growing city. There are also several independent cities in and around Los Angeles, but they are popularly grouped with the city of Los Angeles, either due to being completely engulfed as enclaves by Los Angeles, or lying within its immediate vicinity. Generally, the city is divided into the following areas: Downtown Los Angeles, Northeast - including Highland Park and Eagle Rock areas, the Eastside, South Los Angeles (still often colloquially referred to as South Central by locals), the Harbor Area, Hollywood, Wilshire, the Westside, and the San Fernando and Crescenta Valleys.

The Azusa Street Revival (1906–1909) in Los Angeles was a key milestone in the history of the Pentecostal movement, not long after Christian Fundamentalism received its name and crucial promotion in Los Angeles. In 1909, the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (B.I.O.L.A., now Biola University)published and widely distributed a set of books called The Fundamentals, which presented a defense of the traditional conservative interpretation of the Bible. The term fundamentalism is derived from these books. Los Angeles is also a major hub of the house church Movement.

The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) polices the city of Los Angeles, but the city also maintains four specialized police agencies; The Office of Public Safety, within the General Services Department (which is responsible for security and law enforcement services at city facilities, including City Hall, city parks and libraries, the Los Angeles Zoo, and the Convention Center), the Port Police, within the Harbor Department (which is responsible for land, air and sea law enforcement services at the Port of Los Angeles), the Los Angeles City Schools Police department which handles law enforcement for all city schools, and the Airport Police, within the Los Angeles World Airports Department (which is responsible for law enforcement services at all four city-owned airports, including Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), LA/Ontario International Airport (ONT), LA/Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD), and Van Nuys Airport (VNY), (the busiest general aviation airport in the country).

The campaign to defeat secession was led by then Mayor James Hahn.   Voters created Neighborhood Councils in the Charter Reform of 1999. First proposed by City Council member Joel Wachs in 1996, they were designed to promote public participation in government and make it more responsive to local needs. The councils cover districts which are not necessarily identical to the traditional neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Almost ninety neighborhood councils (NCs) are certified and all "stakeholders" — meaning anyone who lives, works or owns property in a neighborhood — may vote for members of the councils' governing bodies. Some council bylaws allow other people with a stake in the community to cast ballots as well. The councils are official government bodies and so their governing bodies and committees must abide by California's Brown Act, which governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies. The first notable concern of the neighborhood councils collectively was the opposition by some of them in March 2004 to an 18% increase in water rates by the city's Department of Water and Power. This led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review. More recently, some of the councils petitioned the City Council in summer 2006 to allow them to introduce ideas for legislative action, but the City Council put off a decision. The neighborhood councils have been allocated $50,000 each for administration, outreach and approved neighborhood projects.
