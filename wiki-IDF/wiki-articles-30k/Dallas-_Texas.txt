As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon&mdash;by 1900 Dallas was the largest inland cotton market on Earth and led the world in cotton gin machinery manufacturing.

In the 1930s, oil was discovered east of Dallas near Kilgore, Texas, and Dallas's proximity to the discovery put it at the center of the nation's oil market. Oil discoveries in the Permian Basin, the Panhandle, the Gulf Coast, and Oklahoma in the following years further solidified Dallas's position as the hub of the market as it was roughly the geographic center of all 5 regions.
