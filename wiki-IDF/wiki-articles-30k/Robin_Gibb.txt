In 2002, the Bee Gees were appointed as CBEs for their "contribution to music", however investiture at Buckingham Palace was delayed until 2004.

Retrieved 13 August 2009. Music historian Paul Gambaccini described Gibb as "one of the major figures in the history of British music" and "one of the best white soul voices ever". From 2008 to 2011, Gibb was President of the Heritage Foundation, honouring figures in British culture. After a career spanning six decades, Gibb last performed on stage in February 2012 supporting injured British servicemen and women at a charity concert at the London Palladium. On 20 May 2012, Gibb died at the age of 62 from liver and kidney failure brought on by colorectal cancer. As an instrumentalist, Gibb primarily played a variety of keyboards, notably piano, organ and Mellotron on the Bee Gees album Odessa (1969), he also played acoustic guitar and organ on his debut solo album Robin's Reign (1970).   Robin Hugh Gibb was born on 22 December 1949 in Jane Crookall Maternity Home in Douglas, Isle of Man, to Hugh and Barbara Gibb (née Pass). He was the fraternal twin of Maurice Gibb and was the older of the two by 35 minutes. Apart from Maurice, he had one sister, Lesley Evans and two brothers, Barry and Andy. As a kid, Gibb loved to play with fire and would take boxes of matches from the kitchen. His mother said he would start fires anywhere he wanted and called him a "firebug". One fire he set even went to the point of police attention. In 1953, the Gibbs watched the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on the television. Their neighbour in Willaston, Isle of Man, Marie Beck who was the friend of his mother and her sister Peggy. Another neighbour, Helen Kenney was living in Douglas Head as Kenney recalls "Barry and the twins used to come into Mrs. Beck's house and we would mind them, Robin once said to me, 'We're going to be rich one day, we're going to form a band!' "Little did I realise he meant it".  In 1955, when the Gibbs moved back to their home town of Manchester, the Gibb brothers formed The Rattlesnakes. The band consisted of Barry on guitar and vocals, Robin and Maurice on vocals, Paul Frost on drums and Kenny Horrocks on tea-chest bass, and the quintet performed in local theatres in Manchester, their influences at that time such as The Everly Brothers, Cliff Richard and Paul Anka. In May 1958, it was disbanded as Frost and Horrocks left, and the name changed to Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats. In August 1958, the family travelled to Australia on the same ship as Australian musician Red Symons.  The name was finally changed to Bee Gees, when they lived in Queensland, Australia. The Bee Gees' debut television appearance was in 1960 on Desmond Tester's Strictly for Moderns when they performed "Time Is Passing By". When they signed to Festival Records at the start of 1963 (but they were assigned to Leedon Records) they released their debut single, "The Battle of the Blue and the Grey". Their 1964 single "Claustrophobia" is notable for being the first song that features Gibb as an instrumentalist playing melodica. The first Bee Gees record on which he sang lead was "I Don't Think It's Funny" in 1965. In 1966, he wrote his first song "I Don't Know Why I Bother With Myself" that was credited to himself. Also in 1966, Gibb and his brother Barry took more solo vocals. The group's first period of British success in the late 1960s started with "New York Mining Disaster 1941" and the band added drummer Colin Petersen and guitarist Vince Melouney to make the group as a band. They toured the Europe in 1967 and 1968 as well as US in August 1968. The band's first UK #1 was "Massachusetts" which features Gibb on lead vocal. On the day it reached number one, 5 November 1967, Robin Gibb recalled to The Mail on Sunday on 1 November 2009: Gibb spoke of the effects of seeing injured people being carried into the hospital on stretchers in a 2012 interview, "It all got too much for me. I knew that I couldn’t help anyone, and I couldn’t cope with that. I had to get away from the hospital. So Molly [his then girlfriend] and I checked ourselves out, and went to stay at the London home of Robert Stigwood, our manager, then to my parents’ house in Buckinghamshire. I had a delayed reaction; in the days that followed, I started crying and crying and couldn’t stop"."'How my obsession with the Titanic has helped save my life,' says cancer-stricken Robin Gibb working with his son on orchestral requiem to those who perished". Mail Online. Retrieved 5 December 2014 On 13 June 1968, seven songs were recorded including "Indian Gin and Whisky Dry" all of the songs was credited to Gibb alone just his vocals and guitar and the song was later appeared on Idea. On 27 July 1968, Gibb collapsed and fell unconscious. He later admitted to a London nursing home suffering from nervous exhaustion as the group's American tour was postponed. Gibb later moved to Sussex on 31 July to continue his recuperation. Harley Madison of Hullabaloo also made a comment on Gibb's nervous exhaustion. When Gibb collapsed it was only a few hours before the Bee Gees began the tour. Four dates were cancelled and Gibb had another illness called relapse and had to fly back to England to rest a few days. Gibb co-wrote "Only One Woman", The Marbles' debut and successful hit especially in Europe and New Zealand. The single "I Started a Joke" on which he sang lead and co-wrote made the Bee Gees' debut on the US Top 10. Although Gibb claimed that the melody of the song was inspired by the sounds he heard in a jet engine. In August, the band started to record Odessa. In January 1969, Gibb co-wrote another Marbles single "The Walls Fell Down" and co-produced the sessions that same month. However, the rivalry with Barry eventually prompted Robin to leave the group and begin a solo career (three months after guitarist Vince Melouney left the band) after his song "Lamplight" was relegated to the B-side of Barry's song "First of May". Meanwhile, there were rumours during this period that he was dealing with drug problems, allegedly leading his parents to threaten legal action to make him a ward of court (the UK age of majority at that time being 21, while Gibb was only 19). The Bee Gees' last recording session with Robin was in February 1969. Gibb's last performance with the group was on The Tom Jones Show and Top of the Pops before leaving the group. On 19 March 1969, he announced that he was leaving the Bee Gees the same day as the band recorded "Tomorrow Tomorrow" and that became their first single without Robin. In his solo career, Gibb was initially successful with a number 2 UK hit, "Saved by the Bell", which sold over one million copies and received a gold disc. As he performs that song on the German TV show Beat-Club. Also in 1969, Gibb co-produced "Love for Living", the song was performed by Clare Torry and was released as a single. He also starts a mini-tour, making television appearances in dozen countries to promote "Saved by the Bell". By 19 July 1969, New Musical Express announced "Tonight, [Robin Gibb] is fronting a 97-piece orchestra and a 60-piece choir in a recording of his latest composition, 'To Heaven And Back' which was inspired by the Apollo 11 moonshot. It is an entirely instrumental piece, with the choir being used for astral effects. The single will be billed as by 'The Robin Gibb Orchestra and Chorus and it will be rush-released as soon as possible by Polydor". At that time, he was doing a musical score for Henry The Eighth and he's making his own film called Family Tree. Later, it was reported on NME that Gibb wrote dozen of songs for Tom Jones, a meeting between Gibb and Jones was said to be arranged for Gibb's return from a three-day promo trip to Germany. On 31 January and 1 February 1970, Gibb performs in Auckland, New Zealand. However, Robin's first solo album, Robin's Reign (1970) was less successful and he soon found that being a solo artist was unsatisfying. Maurice played bass on the song "Mother and Jack", but was subsequently removed from the project by producer Robert Stigwood. Also in that year, Colin Petersen produced "Make a Stranger Your Friend" performed by Jonathan Kelly, on which Gibb sang on the chorus with Mick Taylor, Klaus Voormann, Madeline Bell, three members of The Family Dogg, Jackie Lomax, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and others. By January 1970, Gibb started to record his second solo album Sing Slowly Sisters until February but was still unreleased. He wanted "Great Caesar's Ghost" to be release as a single around 1970 with "Engines, Aeroplanes" as the B-side but the two songs was not included on that album and was unreleased until this day. On 13 June, Gibb and Maurice reunited and they recorded four songs, the two of the four tracks was released on their upcoming album 2 Years On, the session was originally for Maurice alone as he bought Gibb to the sessions.

In 1976, on the group's Children of the World album, he sang lead on "Love Me" as well as doing falsetto on the track's coda, and he also used his falsetto on his lead vocal part on the song "Lovers" as Barry provided lead vocals on the entire song.

In 2008 Gibb publicly stated that he continued to get on "like a house on fire" with Blair, and claimed that the then Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown regularly listened to the Bee Gees. "He listens to our music every day. Gordon likes our music and I like Gordon," he told The Times. In a tribute upon his death, longtime friend Tony Blair said: "Robin was not only an exceptional and extraordinary musician and songwriter, he was a highly intelligent, interesting and committed human being. He was a great friend with a wonderful open and fertile mind and a student of history and politics."[ ]   Robin Gibb worked on behalf of several charities. He was the organiser of the Sunseeker Ball in aid of the Outward Bound Trust. For the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC), Gibb served as president from 2007 to 2012. He was also the longest serving president (2008–2011) of the Heritage Foundation, which honours figures of British culture and facilitated his campaign on behalf of the Bomber Command Memorial Appeal.[ ]   On 14 August 2010, while performing in Belgium, Gibb began to feel abdominal pains. On 18 August, at an Oxford hospital, he underwent emergency surgery for a blocked intestine, the same condition that his brother, Maurice, suffered from (Maurice died from a heart attack while awaiting surgery for the condition). Gibb recovered and returned to perform concerts in New Zealand and Australia. During this time, Gibb was also involved in promoting fund-raising for the memorial dedicated to RAF Bomber Command in Green Park, London. Gibb also wrote The Titanic Requiem with his son Robin-John, which was recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic in 2012.  Gibb continued to make television appearances and other events following his surgery, but in April 2011 he was forced by health problems to cancel his tour of Brazil. Another concert in Paris was cancelled in October 2011. On 14 October, Gibb was due to perform the charity single with the Soldiers, but was again rushed to hospital with severe abdominal pains. On 18 October, following his release from the hospital, Gibb appeared on ITV's The Alan Titchmarsh Show  looking gaunt and frail. On 27 October 2011, Gibb cancelled an appearance only minutes before he was due to perform at the Poppy Appeal Concert in London. Later the same week however, Gibb was seen in London and quoted as saying he felt "absolutely great".  In November 2011, he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, which had metastasised to his liver several months earlier. In an interview published in The Mail on Sunday on 22 January 2012, Gibb spoke for the first time of the cancer. "For more than 18 months, I had lived with an inflammation of the colon; then I was diagnosed with colon cancer, which spread to the liver. I have undergone chemotherapy, however, and the results&nbsp;— to quote my doctor&nbsp;— have been 'spectacular'. It’s taken a toll, naturally, but the strange thing is that I've never felt seriously ill. I’ve mostly felt great. There have been many false claims around, which I'd like to dispel. I am not and have never been 'at death's door'. Nor do I have a team of alternative doctors working on my health. That's not true, although I'm not averse to healthy remedies for any illness. I feel they can go together with conventional medicine. I do eat health foods and drink herbal teas made for me by Dwina, my wife and RJ's mother. Other than that, I am under the care of Dr. Peter Harper at The London Clinic". In March 2012, Gibb was hospitalised for intestinal surgery and cancelled scheduled appearances while recovering. In April, however, he contracted pneumonia and fell into a coma.  Although he came out of his coma later in April, his colorectal cancer had advanced and he died in London on 20 May 2012 at the age of 62 from liver and kidney failure.  His funeral was held on 8 June 2012 and he was buried at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, near his home in Thame, Oxfordshire.  In September of the same year, a blue plaque was placed on the house. The Who's Roger Daltrey recalls: "A lovely, lovely guy. I hear everyone talking about the success of their career but I haven't heard many talk about him as a singer and I used to think he was one of the best. To me, singing is about moving people and Robin's voice had something about it that could move me and, I'm sure, millions of others. It was almost like his heart was on the outside." John Travolta recalls, "I thought Robin was one of the most wonderful people, gifted, generous and a real friend to everyone he knew. And we'll miss him." Tim Rice described Gibb as "a charming man". Rice adds: "I saw him only a couple of weeks ago, He wasn't at all well but was putting up a marvelous fight. It's a terrible loss for the music industry." Gibb's friend Cliff Richard says, "We are a fraternity of people who sing pop and rock and Robin is another one of us who's gone too soon, too early." Ringo Starr told the BBC: "Robin will be remembered as a musician and as a singer and part of the Bee Gees." Dionne Warwick says: "He was wonderful. He was a jokester. He had an incredibly witty sense of humour and was fun to be around." Kenny Rogers adds: "Robin was a part of something unique. Mostly, Robin was a good guy who didn't deserve to die this young. We will all miss him for what he was as a person and what he brought to music." Other artists paid tribute to Gibb including Justin Timberlake (who played Robin in the SNL skit The Barry Gibb Talk Show), Ronan Keating, Liam Gallagher, Hanson, David Dramain of Disturbed, Atmosphere, Paula Abdul, Jake Shears of The Scissor Sisters, Jermaine Dupri, Peter Frampton, Adam Hills, Peter Andre, Richard Marx, Taboo of The Black Eyed Peas, The Doors, Bruno Mars, Sam Sparro, Elton John, Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed, Duran Duran, The Script and Bryan Adams.
