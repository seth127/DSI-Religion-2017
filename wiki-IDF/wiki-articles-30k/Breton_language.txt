 Breton  (Brezhoneg Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh or  (in Morbihan)) is a Celtic language spoken in Brittany (Breton: Breizh; ), France. Breton is a Brythonic language brought from Great Britain to Armorica by migrating Britons during the Early Middle Ages; it is thus an Insular Celtic language and not closely related to the Gaulish language, which had been spoken in pre-Roman Gaul. Breton is most closely related to Cornish, both being Southwestern Brittonic languages. Welsh and the extinct Cumbric are the more distantly-related Brittonic languages. The other regional language of Brittany, Gallo, is a langue d'oïl. It is a Romance language, thus ultimately descended from Latin, (unlike the similarly-named ancient Celtic language Gaulish) and consequently very close to French, although not mutually intelligible. Having declined from more than 1 million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, Breton is classified as "severely endangered" by the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33 percent between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709. Données clés sur breton, Ofis ar Brezhoneg  Breton is spoken in Lower Brittany, roughly to the west of a line linking Plouha (west of Saint Brieuc) and La Roche-Bernard (east of Vannes). It comes from a Brittonic language community (see image) that once extended from Great Britain to Armorica (present-day Brittany) and had even established a toehold in Galicia (in present-day Spain). Old Breton is attested from the 9th century. It was the language of the upper classes until the 12th century, after which it became the language of commoners in West Brittany (Breizh Izel: "Lower Brittany"). The nobility, followed by the bourgeoisie, adopted French. The written language of the Duchy of Brittany was Latin, switching to French in the 15th century. There exists a limited tradition of Breton literature. Some Old Breton vocabulary remains in the present day as philosophical and scientific terms in Modern Breton. The French monarchy was not concerned with the minority languages of France spoken by the lower classes, and required the use of French for government business as part of its policy of national unity. During the French Revolution, the government introduced policies favouring French over the regional languages, which it pejoratively referred to as patois. The revolutionaries assumed that reactionary and monarchist forces preferred regional languages to try to keep the peasant masses under-informed. In 1794, Bertrand Barère submitted his "report on the patois" to the Committee of Public Safety in which he said that "federalism and superstition speak Breton". Since the 19th century, under the Third, Fourth and Fifth Republics, the government has attempted to stamp out minority languages in state schools, including Breton, in an effort to build a national culture. Teachers humiliated students for using their regional languages, and such practices prevailed until the late 1960s.ICBL information about Breton at breizh.net In the early 21st century, due to the political centralization of France, the influence of the media, and the increasing mobility of people, only about 200,000 people can speak Breton. This has dramatically declined from more than a million in 1950. The majority of today's speakers are more than 60 years old, and Breton is now classified as an endangered language. At the beginning of the 20th century, half of the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton; the other half were bilingual. By 1950, there were only 100,000 monolingual Bretons, and a rapid decline has occurred, with likely no monolingual speakers left today. A statistical survey in 1997 found around 300,000 speakers in Breizh izel, of whom about 190,000 were aged 60 or older. Few 15-to 19-year-olds spoke Breton.Fañch Broudic, Qui parle breton aujourd'hui? Qui le parlera demain? Brest: Brud Nevez, 1999 In 1925, Professor Roparz Hemon founded the Breton-language review Gwalarn. During its 19-year run, Gwalarn tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language. Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, Al Liamm replaced Gwalarn. Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language. In 1977, Diwan schools were founded to teach Breton by immersion. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the education section for more information. The Asterix comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the Gaulish village where Asterix lives is in the Armorica peninsula, which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including The Adventures of Tintin, Spirou, Titeuf, Hägar the Horrible, Peanuts and Yakari. Some original media is created in Breton. The sitcom, Ken Tuch', is in Breton. Pdf. Radio Kerne, broadcasting from Finistère, has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (Lancelot du Lac, Shakespeare in Love, Marion du Faouet, Sezneg) and TV series (Columbo, Perry Mason) have also been translated and broadcast in Breton.  Poets, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including Yann-Ber Kalloc'h, Roparz Hemon, Anjela Duval, Pêr-Jakez Helias and Youenn Gwernig, are now known internationally. Today, Breton is the only living Celtic language that is not recognized by the national government as an official or regional language. The French State refuses to change the second article of the Constitution (added in 1994), which establishes that "the language of the Republic is French." Although Breton was long the Celtic language with the highest number of speakers, it is now endangered. The first Breton dictionary, the Catholicon, was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words. In the early 21st century, the Ofis ar Brezhoneg ("Office of the Breton language") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the Spilhennig to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an Internationalization and localization policy asking Google, Firefoxhttp://www.mozilla.org/br/firefox/fx/ Firefox ha Thunderbird and SPIP to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the Breton Wikipedia started, which now counts more than 50,000 articles. On March 2007, the Ofis ar Brezhoneg signed a tripartite agreement with Regional Council of Brittany and Microsoft Microsoft au secours des langues celtiques y compris du breton for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, Facebook added Breton as one of its 121 languages. Facebook. Et maintenant une version en breton after three years of talks between the Ofis and the American giant.  Breton is spoken mainly in Lower Brittany, but also in a more dispersed way in Upper Brittany (where Gallo is spoken alongside Breton and French), and in areas around the world that have Breton emigrants. The four traditional dialects of Breton correspond to medieval bishoprics rather than to linguistic divisions.  They are leoneg (léonard, of the county of Léon), tregerieg (trégorrois, of Trégor), kerneveg (cornouaillais, of Cornouaille), and gwenedeg (vannetais, of Vannes).  Guérandais was spoken up to the beginning of the 20th century in the region of Guérande and Batz-sur-Mer.  There are no clear boundaries between the dialects because they form a dialect continuum, varying only slightly from one village to the next. Gwenedeg, however, is almost mutually unintelligible with most of the other dialects.Kergoat, Lukian. "Breton Dialects" in Celtic Culture, pp. 250 ff. ABC-CLIO (Sta. Barbara), 2006. http://www.fr.brezhoneg.bzh/46-situation-de-la-langue.htm#par1660   As noted, only French is an official language of France. Supporters of Breton and other minority languages continue to argue for their recognition, education in public schools and place in public life. In July 2008, the legislature amended the French Constitution, adding article 75-1: les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France (the regional languages belong to the heritage of France). This acknowledged the significance of the languages. The government has not provided official recognition, rights or funds to support use of these languages. On the 27 October 2015, the Senate rejected the draft law on ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages such as Breton. Regional and departmental authorities use Breton to a very limited extent, for example in signage. Some bilingual signage has also been installed, such as street name signs in Breton towns. One station of the Rennes metro system has signs in both French and Breton. Under the French law known as Toubon, it is illegal for commercial signage to be in Breton alone. Signs must be bilingual or French only. Since commercial signage usually has limited physical space, most businesses have signs only in French. Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg, the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the daily use of Breton. It created the Ya d'ar brezhoneg campaign, to encourage enterprises, organisations and communes to promote the use of Breton, for example by installing bilingual signage or translating their websites into Breton. In the late 20th century, the French government considered incorporating the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called Diwan) into the state education system. This action was blocked by the French Constitutional Council based on the 1994 amendment to the Constitution that establishes French as the language of the republic. Therefore, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The Toubon Law implemented the amendment, asserting that French is the language of public education. The Diwan schools were founded in Brittany in 1977 to teach Breton by immersion. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. They have gained fame owing to their high level of results in school exams. Diwan FAQ, #6. Breton-language schools do not receive funding from the national government, though the Brittany Region may fund them. Another teaching method is a bilingual approach by Div Yezh ("Two Languages") in the State schools, created in 1979. Dihun ("Awakening") was created in 1990 for bilingual education in the Catholic schools. In 2012, 14,709 Données clés sur breton, Ofis ar Brezhoneg. pupils (about 1.63% of all pupils in Brittany) attended Diwan, Div Yezh and Dihun schools. Their number has increased yearly. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the president of the Regional Council, had a goal of 20,000 pupils by 2010, but is encouraged by their progress. Interview with Jean-Yves Le Drian, the president of the Region Council. In 2007, some 4,500 to 5,000 adults followed a Breton language course (such as evening course, correspondence, or other). The family transmission of Breton in 1999 is estimated to be 3 percent.   Growth of the percentage of pupils in bilingual education.  Percentage of pupils in bilingual education per department.

In addition to bilingual education (including Breton-medium education), the region has introduced Breton language in the primary education, primarily in the department of Finistère. These "initiation" sessions are generally one to three hours per week, and consist of songs and games. Schools in secondary education (collèges and lycées) offer some courses of Breton (given as either foreign language or option, such as German or Spanish). In 2010, nearly 5,000 students in Brittany were reported to be taking this option. L'option de breton Vowels in Breton may be short or long. All unstressed vowels are short; stressed vowels can be short or long (vowel lengths are not noted in usual orthographies as they are implicit in the phonology of particular dialects, and not all dialects pronounce stressed vowels as long). All vowels can also be nasalized, which is noted by appending an 'n' letter after the base vowel, or by adding a combining tilde above the vowel, or more commonly by non-ambiguously appending an 'ñ' letter after the base vowel (this depends on the orthographic variant). Diphthongs are . [ʁ] is used in the French-influenced standard language whereas [r] (or its weaker allophone [ɾ]) and [ɹ] are used in more conservative dialects in northern Léon (Bro-Leon) and Trégor (Bro-Dreger) and by elderly speakers in Morbihan (Bro-Gwened).

However, this is uncertain: for instance, ''menhir'' is ''peulvan'' or ''maen hir'' ("long stone"), ''maen sav'' ("straight stone") (two words: noun + adjective) in Breton. ''Dolmen'' is a misconstructed word (it should be ''taol-'''''v'''''aen''). Some studies state{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that these words were borrowed from [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. ''Maen hir'' can be directly translated from Welsh as "long stone" (which is exactly what a ''menhir'' or ''maen hir'' is).  The French word ''baragouiner'' (‘to jabber in a foreign language’) is derived from Breton ''bara'' 'bread' and ''gwin'' 'wine'.  The French word ''goéland'' (‘large seagull’) is derived from Breton ''gwelan'', which shares the same root as English ‘gull’ (Welsh ''gwylan'').  ==Orthography== The first Breton texts, contained in the Leyde manuscript, were written at the end of the 8th century: 50 years prior to the [[Strasbourg Oaths]], considered to be the earliest example of [[French language|French]]. After centuries of orthography [[calque]]d on the French model, in the 1830s [[Jean-François Le Gonidec]] created a modern phonetic system for the language.  During the early years of the 20th century, a group of writers known as ''Emglev ar Skrivanerien'' elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system. They made it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of [[Cornouaille]], Leon and Trégor (known as from ''Kernev'', ''Leon'' and ''Treger'' in Breton). This '''KLT''' orthography was established in 1911. At the same time writers of the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a phonetic system also based on that of Le Gonidec.  Following proposals made during the 1920s, the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in 1941 to create an orthographic system to represent all four dialects. This ''{{lang|br|Peurunvan}}'' ("wholly unified") orthography was significant for the inclusion of the ''zh'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]], which represents a {{IPA|/h/}} in Vannetais and corresponds to a {{IPA|/z/}} in the KLT dialects.  In 1955 [[François Falc'hun]] and the group Emgleo Breiz proposed a new orthography. It was designed to use a set of [[graphemes]] closer to the conventions of French. This ''Orthographie Universitaire'' ("University Orthography", known in Breton as ''Skolveurieg'') was given official recognition by the French authorities as the "official orthography of Breton in French education." It was opposed in the region and today is used only by the magazine ''Brud Nevez'' and the publishing house Emgléo Breiz.  Between 1971 and 1974, a new standard orthography was devised — the ''etrerannyezhel'' or ''interdialectale''. This system is based on the derivation of the words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  Today the majority of writers continue to use the ''Peurunvan orthography'', and it is the version taught in most Breton-language schools.  ===Alphabet=== Breton is written in the [[Latin script]]. ''Peurunvan'', the most commonly used orthography, consists of the following letters:  : a, b, ch, c'h, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, z  The [[circumflex]], [[grave accent]], [[Trema (diacritic)|trema]] and [[tilde]] appear on some letters. These [[diacritic]]s are used in the following way:  : â, ê, î, ô, û, ù, ü, ñ  See [[Wikiversity:Introduction to Breton/Breton pronunciation]] for an introduction to the Breton alphabet and pronunciation.  ===Differences between ''Skolveurieg'' and ''Peurunvan''=== Both orthographies use the above alphabet, although ''é'' is used only in Skolveurieg.  Differences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan, final [[obstruent]]s, which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in [[sandhi]] before voiced sounds, are represented by a grapheme that indicates a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: ''braz'' (big), ''brasoc'h'' (bigger).  In addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention, which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs by nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one. No distinction is made in pronunciation, e.g. '''brezhoneg''' ''Breton language'' vs. '''brezhonek''' ''Breton (adj)''.

The pronunciation [ɛ̞, œ̞, ɔ̞] appears mainly in front of clusters ''lc’h, rc’h'' (less often also before ''c’h''), before semivowels [j, w], before other clusters beginning with ''r, l'' and before ''rr''. Stressed long ''e, eu, o'' are realized as [eː, øː, oː]. #{{Note|Pron-6}} In Gwenedeg velars or labialized velars are palatalized when followed by ''e'' and ''i'': ''k, g, kw/kou, c’hw/c’hou, gw/gou, w/ou, sk'' to [c, ɟ, cɥ, hɥ, ɟɥ, ɥ, sc/ʃc]. Instead of [c, ɟ] also [tʃ, dʒ] may appear. #{{Note|Pron-7}} In Gwenedeg word-final ''g'' and ''k'' is palatalized to [c] after preceding ''i''. #{{Note|Pron-8}} But before a vowel other than ''i'' the digraph ''ni'' is written instead of ''gn'', e.g. ''bleniañ'' to drive’, radical ''blegn'', 1PS preterite ''blegnis'', 3PS preterite ''blenias''. #{{Note|Pron-9}} But mute in words such as '''''h'''a(g), '''h'''e(c’h), '''h'''o(c’h), '''h'''oll, '''h'''on/'''h'''or/'''h'''ol''. Silent in Gwenedeg and Leoneg. #{{Note|Pron-10}} ''I'' is realized as [j] when it precedes or follows a vowel (or when between vowels), but in words such as ''l'''i'''en, l'''i'''orzh, rakd'''i'''azezañ'' the letter ''i'' is pronounced as [iː] (in orthography ''ï'' may be used:''lïen, lïorzh, rakdïazezañ''). #{{Note|Pron-11}} Group ''ilh'' is pronounced [ʎ] when it follows an vowel, following a consonant the group is pronounced [iʎ]. But before a vowel other than ''i'' ''li'' is written instead of ''ilh'', e.g. ''heuliañ'' to follow, radical ''heuilh'', 1PS preterite ''heulhis'', 3PS preterite ''heulias''. In some regions instead of [ʎ] may appear pronunciation [j]. #{{Note|Pron-12}} Word-finally following a cluster of unvoiced consonants. #{{Note|Pron-13}} In front of ''k, g''. #{{Note|Pron-14}} The digraph ''ou'' is realized same as the letter ''w'' when preceded or followed by a vowel (or when between vowels), but in words such as ''Doue, douar, gouarn'' the digraph ''ou'' is pronounced [uː]. #{{Note|Pron-15}} The digraph ''où'' marks plural ending. Its pronunciation varies throughout Brittany: [u, o, ø, ow, aw, aɥ, ɔɥ] rating geographically from Northwest Leon to Southeast Gwened. #{{Note|Pron-16}} The letter ''v'' is usually pronounced [v], but word-finally (except word-final ''ñv'') is pronounced usually as [w] or in KLT, as [ɥ] in Gwenedeg and as [f] in Goëlo.

In words ''bli'''v''', Gwiskri'''v''', gwi'''v''', li'''v''', pi'''v''', ri'''v''''' are ''v'' is pronounced [u] in KLT, [ɥ] in Gwenedeg and [f] in Goëlo.

''Z'' is generally mute in Kerneweg, Tregerieg and Gwenedeg, but in Leoneg ''z(h)'' is always pronounced. #{{Note|Pron-18}} Used to distinguish words ''stêr'' river, ''hêr'' heir, ''kêr'' town (written also ''kaer'') from ''ster'' sense, ''her ''bold, ''ker'' dear. #{{Note|Pron-19}} Used to distinguish ''trôad'' circuit/tour from ''troad'' foot. #{{Note|Pron-20}} In northern dialects (mainly in Leoneg), there is a tendency to voice ''c’h'' between vowels.
