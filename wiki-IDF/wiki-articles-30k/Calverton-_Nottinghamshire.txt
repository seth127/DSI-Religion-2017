  Calverton  is a Nottinghamshire parish, of some , about seven miles north-east of Nottingham, England, and situated, like nearby Woodborough and Lambley, on one of the small tributaries of the Dover Beck. The 2011 census found 7,076 inhabitants in 2,987 households. About two miles to the north of the village is the site of the supposed deserted settlement of Salterford. The parish is bounded on the south-east by Woodborough,  to the south-west by Arnold, Papplewick and Ravenshead, to the north by Blidworth, and to the north-east by Oxton and Epperstone.Calverton ecclesiastical parish map; The Civil Parish is larger and includes part of Daybrook ecclesiastical parish, either side of Gravelly Hollow. During most of its existence Calverton was a forest village, in that part of Sherwood known as Thorney Wood Chase, with a rural economy limited by a lack of grazing land, in which handicrafts (like woodworking and the knitting of stockings), must in consequence have assumed a more than usual importance.J. Thirsk, (ed.), The Agrarian History of England and Wales, Vol.IV, 1500-1640 (Cambridge, 1967), p.97; J. R. Birrell, 'Peasant Craftsmen in the Medieval Forest', Agricultural History Review, 17 (1969), passim. The parliamentary enclosure of 1780 brought some agrarian progress to the village, but it was not until the opening of a colliery by the National Coal Board in 1952, that the village began to assume its present identity, with new housing estates and marked population growth.  The colliery closed in 1999 and while a small industrial estate provides some local employment, Calverton has taken on the character of a large commuter village. In May 1974 the village was officially twinned with , in the Loire valley of France . The place appears as Calvretone in the Domesday survey of 1086 and as Kalvirton in the Rotuli Hundredorum  of 1275.   Scholars believe that the name means "the farm of the calves", from OE calf (genitive plural "calfra" + tūn.J. Glover, A. Mawer & F. Stenton, Place-Names of Nottinghamshire (Cambridge, 1940), p.158 ;A.D. Mills, Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names  (Oxford, 2003); H. Mutschmann, The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire: Their Origin and Development (Cambridge, 1913), p.29 It is intriguing that a forest village, with a presumed shortage of grazing land, should be named for the young of domestic cattle; perhaps it was the atypical presence of a calf farm, in the woodland landscape, that ensured its name.  Calverton is one of a number of settlements in the area  (with Oxton, Bulcote and Lambley), which contain animal place name elements; this has inevitably led to speculation that there was some undiscovered ancient functional connection between the places. Salterford (q.v.) was Saltreford in 1086 and probably means "ford of the salters",  where salter refers to a salt–dealer or carrier, rather than a maker of the commodity.J. Glover, A. Mawer & F. Stenton, ibid Although the place was situated in the forest, the road to York, or King’s Highway (the precursor of the A614) passed close by, and this may well have been frequented by salt-carriers.Mutschmann, Ibid, p.116 An alternative explanation that it is derived from a ford near to a saltery, or deer-leap, (Latin saltatorium)  on the boundary of the royal hunting ground of Sherwood Forest, and had nothing to do with salt is, perhaps, less likely.M. C. Higham, ‘Take it with a pinch of Salt’ in Landscape History, vol 25 (2003), pp.59-65 ; E.P.Shirley, Some account of English deer parks: with notes on the management of deer (1867), p.14 Some deer parks were established in the Anglo-Saxon era, but this would be a very early use of the word saltery. There are traces of two Roman marching camps in a field north-east of the Oxton Road and Whinbush Lane crossroads (). A smaller one of four acres is set wholly within the defences of a larger, perhaps earlier, one of about twenty-six acres.D. N. Riley, ‘Temporary Camps at Calverton, Notts’, Britannia, vol.14 (1983), p.270 Marching camps traces are thought to be the remains of the entrenchments made by an army unit for an overnight stop, where there was the chance of an attack. The dimensions of the camp are dictated by the size of the army unit. A lead figurine was found at ‘a hill-top site’ in Calverton. It is of a naked seated female personage with long hair, topped by a plain round head-dress. It may depict a fertility goddess, perhaps a local version of Venus.J.M.C.Toynbee, Art in Britain under the Romans (1964), p.356; M.Todd, The Coritani (1991), p.114 Three coin hoards are listed as having been found in Calverton. Nearly two hundred denarii, chiefly of Trajan and Hadrian (A.D. 98-138), were found in 1797 in a broken pot somewhere in the parish.W. Page (ed.), The Victoria history of the county of Nottingham, vol 2 (1906), p.24 More recently, two very similar coin hoards were unearthed at sites less than three hundred yards apart. The first in June 1959, during work on the foundations of Manor Park Infants' School, Collyer Road, and the second during the building of a house in Crookdole Lane in about April 1960. No structural remains were detected with either hoard and the only associated archaeological material was the earthenware pot in which the first hoard was concealed.H B. Mattingly, ‘Two hoards of Roman coins from Calverton', Transactions of the Thoroton Society, 64 (1960), pp. 9-19 While most Roman coin hoards are believed to have been buried for safe-keeping, with the intention of being eventually recovered,  it is possible that hoards may instead sometimes represent communal votive offerings to the gods. The Domesday survey indicates that the Calverton of 1086 was held by three parties: the Archbishop of York had one part, as a berewick (or outlying estate) of his manor at Blidworth, with a church and priest, and the other two parts were held by Roger of Poitou and the thegn Aelfric of Colwick .J. Morris (ed.), Domesday Book, vol. 28: Nottinghamshire (Chichester, 1977), pp.5,16,30;Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland The church is one of only eighty-five mentioned amongst some four hundred places names listed in Nottinghamshire and it is perhaps possible that its existence, at that early time, was due to it being situated on land that was part of an archiepiscopal estate. Two freeman (sochemannus), thirteen villagers (villanus), two smallholders (bordarius) and a priest are mentioned and, assuming that these were the heads of eighteen households, the population of Calverton in 1086 was perhaps around seventy persons.N.Goose,  & A Hinde, ‘Estimating local population sizes at fixed points in time. Part II: Specific sources’,  Local Population Studies 78  (2007) pp.75-6 The Protestation Returns of 1642 were intended to record a full list of all male inhabitants aged eighteen years and over in each parish, who took an oath to 'live and die for the true Protestant religion'. A population total can be easily calculated by allowing for the estimated proportion of the population under the age of eighteen years, perhaps 40% and doubling to allow for women.vide A. Whiteman, ‘The Protestation Returns of 1641–1642: part I, the general organisation’, Local Population Studies, 55 (1995), pp.14–27 Seventy-five names are listed in the Calverton parish returns, with the note ‘none refused’.W. F. Webster (ed.), Protestation Returns, 1641/2 — Notts/Derbys, (West Bridgford, 1980) A population estimate for the village, immediately before the English Civil War, is therefore 250. The Hearth Tax was introduced, after the Civil War, in 1662 to provide a regular source of income for the newly restored monarch, King Charles II. Sometimes referred to as ‘chimney money’, the tax was essentially a property tax on households (rather than houses) graded according to the number of their fireplaces. The 1664 Hearth tax returns show that Calverton had seventy-nine chargeable hearths in thirty-five households and seventeen not-chargeable hearths in seventeen households which had been exempted from the tax.W F Webster ( ed.), Nottinghamshire hearth tax, 1664:1674, Thoroton Society Record Series, 37, (1988) p.97  A multiplier, recommended by some authorities, is 4.3, which gives a population for Calverton at the end of the English Civil War,  of 223 in the fifty-two households.T. Arkell, 'Multiplying factors for estimating population totals from the Hearth Tax', Local Population Studies, 28 (1982), pp.51-7 Village surnames which span the Civil War period include Cooper, Wilkinson, Martin, Pepper, Mottram and Sturtivant. Soon after the Restoration, Calverton lost its vicar, John Allot, for non-conformity. The Act of Uniformity 1662 required the use of all the rites and ceremonies in the Book of Common Prayer in church services. Revd. Allot, a puritan, was one of nearly two thousand clergymen who refused to conform and  were ejected from the Church of England for not complying with the Act. He went to London and ministered in private, but died soon afterwards.E.Calamy & S. Palmer, The Nonconformist's Memorial:Being an Account of the Ministers… (1775), p.280 The Act encouraged the notion of non-conformity and religious dissent in English society. By 1676 it was of urgent interest to discover the religious opinions of the people, since the Catholic James was likely to succeed his brother King Charles II. This anxiety led to the Compton Census, a national ecclesiastical survey named for Henry Compton,  Bishop of London. Adults (i.e. people over the age of 16) of each parish were recorded as either communicants, popish recusants, or other dissenters. In Calverton 129 communicants were recorded, no recusants, but a remarkable fifty-two dissenters.E. L. Guilford, (ed.), ‘Nottinghamshire in 1676’, Transactions of the Thoroton Society 28 (1924), p.110  Demographic historians suggest that the proportion of the population over sixteen in settlements at the time was about 65%, so a simple calculation gives the total population as 278.T. Arkell, ‘A method for estimating population totals from the Compton Census returns’, in K. Schürer and T. Arkell (eds.), Surveying the people:the interpretation and use of document sources for the study of population in the later seventeenth century (Oxford,1992), pp. 97–116. The population estimate is less interesting however than the high proportion of dissenters, which may well have been a result of the ejection from his living of Calverton's vicar, James Stephenson, at some time between 1654 and July 1656, by reason that he was 'destitute... aged and impotent', and also by the 1662 ejection of John Allot for non-conformity (above).H.H. Copnall, Notes and Extracts from the Nottinghamshire County Records of the 17th Century (Nottingham, 1915), pp.119-20,144 Ejections left a void in a parish, which may have facilitated the growth of groups of dissenters. In 1677 Robert Thoroton commented that Calverton was '... a populous village, with an empty church, for the most part'.R. Thoroton, revised by J. Throsby, The antiquities of Nottinghamshire (1790–96), vol. 3, p.42 In 1743 a new Archbishop of York, Thomas Herring, was appointed.Calverton was part of the Diocese of York until 1884 when the Diocese of Southwell was created. Soon after taking up his post he wrote to all the clergy within the diocese, seeking information about the parishes they served.S.L.Ollard & P.C.Walker(eds.), Archbishop Herring's visitation returns Vol. iv,1743, Yorkshire Archaeological Society, Record Series 72, (Wakefield, 1930), p.176  Calverton’s curate, Maurice Pugh (1705-1766), replied to the archiepiscopal enquiry, and his answers give interesting incidental information about life in the village in the mid 18th century: * I. We have about eighty Families in Our Parish we have but two Families Dissenters, one of them Presbyterian, one Quaker. * II. We have a licensd Meeting House in Our Parish for the Presbyterians, but it has not been made use of these 5 or 6 Years * III. We have a Charity School, but not endowed, to teach fourteen Children to read english at the Direction of Mr: Abel Smith, Trustee to the late Mr. Labray of this Town. the Children are instructed as the Canon requires. * IV. We have no Alms House, but have land given to the Poor, by Mrs. Jane Pepper late of this Parish and others the Rent of which is 2 : 7 : 0 per An.  The Vicar and Parish Officers dispose of it jointly to the Poor, we know of no abuse in the management of it. * V. I reside upon My Vicarage of Calverton. * VI. I do the Duty Myself * VII. I know of no such Persons. (Non-baptised churchgoers) * VIII. I read the publick Service once every Lords Day in My Church Morning & Evening alternately I am obliged to do Duty in the Church of Woodborough that is joined with Calverton, I presume the small allowance from the Church of Southwell has been the Reason that Service could not be performed according to Canon * IX. I catechise the Children and Servants during the time of Lent, and all the Summer from May to Michaelmass, and spend some time every Sunday Evening in instructing the Youth in the Principles of the Christian Religion during that time. * X. I administer the Sacrament four times in Year at least. I have about a hundred and fifty Communicants they all receive two or three Times in the Year, about three score last Easter. * XI. I give open and timely Warning of the Sacrament before it is administred, My Parishioners give Me Notice when any Young persons design to communicate, or new Servants, but the elderly People I have not called upon to do so but will for the future. I have had no Reason to refuse the Sacrament to any Person. Calverton May 21. 1744 MAURICE PUGH Vicar If the family size was 4.75 in 1743, then the settlement had about 380 inhabitants at that time. Twenty years later, at the time of Archbishop Drummond’s 1764 visitation, Maurice Pugh reported that the number of families had risen to 'above 110', and so the number of villagers was perhaps 520. Throsby, however, writing in the 1790s said that ‘the village consist of 100 dwellings'.H. Fisher (ed.), Church life in Georgian Nottinghamshire: Archbishop Drummond’s parish visitation returns, 1764, Thoroton Society Record Series, vol 46  (Nottingham, 2012), p.25; R. Thoroton, revised by J. Throsby  The antiquities of Nottinghamshire  (1790–96), vol. 3, p.43 By the time of the first decennial census of 1801 the population had risen to 636 in 129 families.1801-02 (9) Abstract of the answers and returns made pursuant to an act, passed in the forty-first Year of His Majesty King George III. Intituled, "an act for taking an account of the population of Great Britain, and the increase or diminution thereof." Enumeration. Part I. England and Wales, p.277 Until the opening of the colliery in 1952, the greatest social change in Calverton’s history had been arguably the parliamentary enclosure of 1778-80.  By the time that an enclosure petition was presented to Parliament on 1 December 1778 by ‘several landowners and persons interested’, some 996 acres, or about 30% of the parish had already been enclosed.W.E. Tate, Parliamentary Land Enclosures in the county of Nottingham during the 18th and 19th Centuries (1743-1868), Thoroton Society Record Series, 5 (1935),p.66 Some of these acres would of course have been accounted for by the houses and gardens of the settlement itself and the rest had been enclosed piece-meal over centuries. The award, when it came in 1780, would reveal that there had been only 51 acres of the open fields left to enclose.  This is about 1½% of the total area of the parish, so any notion that the primary objective of Calverton's enclosure was to rearrange the village arable from strips and furlongs in large communally farmed fields, into the landscape of today, must be resisted. The rest of the land enclosed was about 550 acres of warren and Sansom wood and 1728 acres of common and forest, much of it to the west of the Old Rufford Road (A614). Calverton was one of forty or so townships within the ancient bounds of Sherwood Forest, and so was subject to forest law, which protected both the animals (primarily deer) for the exclusive use of the king. It may be that because of this,  agricultural improvement and commercial development in Calverton was different from other, more purely agricultural, settlements.For the royal forests and forest law, see: G.J. Turner (ed.)Select pleas of the forest  (Selden Soc. 13, 1899) Specifically the village was situated in one of the two administrative districts or bailiwicks into which Sherwood Forest was divided, the southern part called Thorney Wood Chase, of which the Earl of Chesterfield was hereditary keeper.S.N. Mastoris,  ‘A newly–Discovered Perambulation Map of Sherwood Forest in the Early Seventeenth Century’, Transactions of the Thoroton Society,102 (1998),p.81 The Chase was formerly well wooded and stocked with fallow deer, but growth of population and changes in agricultural practice were altering the character of the area. Back in 1609 Richard Bankes’ map had shown the progress of enclosure in the parish.S.N. Mastoris and S.M. Groves, (eds.), Sherwood Forest in 1609,Thoroton Society, Record Series, XL (Nottingham, 1997) Calverton, like most settlements on Bankes’ map, was found to be surrounded by a number of large communally farmed arable fields. These must have been in existence for many centuries, but by 1609 each of the large open fields had had some of its land changed into non-communable closes, some of which may have been used for pasture. In Calverton the map shows about twenty small closes converted out of a portion of a field, The Moores, to the north east of the village, between the present Carrington Lane and the Doverbeck. Nearby was a bigger New Close. Many other closes, large and small, had been created between Dark Lane and the southern parish boundary with Woodborough, in the large Hyll Feild. More closes line the western edge of the Hyll Feild along the course of the stream which now flows near George’s Lane. Other parts of the parish were less subject to the making of permanent closes, as they were more wooded and breck agriculture was practised. These brecks were temporary enclosures made out of the forest waste land and sheep walks.  Plots of land were fenced off and ploughed as arable for up to seven years, after which period the fences were taken down and the land reverted to open forest. In Calverton each messuage was entitled, as a customary or common right,  to an acre of the breck, and each cottage to half an acre.D. V.Fowkes, ‘The Breck System of Sherwood Forest', Transactions of the Thoroton Society, 81 (1977), pp.55-61 According to Dr. Thoroton's history of the county, the freeholders of Calverton in 1612 were Christopher Strelley, John Sturtivant, Robert Cooper, John Lees, Thomas Leeson, Ed. Benet, John Barber, John Lambrey, Humfr. Youle, Euseby Marshall of Arnall, John Chaworth of Southwell, esquire and John Cressewell.R. Thoroton, revised by J. Throsby  The antiquities of Nottinghamshire,  (1790–96), vol. 3, p.42 A bill was presented in March 1779 by the Nottinghamshire MP Lord Edward Bentinck, who was the younger brother of the third Duke of Portland. It noted counter-petitions to some of its provisions by the Earl of Chesterfield and other smaller owners. The Earl of Chesterfield's objections concerns the alleged insufficient compensation to be allowed to him as hereditary ranger of Thorney Wood Chase. The earl's claims were apparently met by the promoters, and the bill was amended accordingly.Journals of the House of Commons, 22 March, 19 Geo III, Volume 37, p.44; W. E. Tate, ‘Parliamentary Counter-Petitions during the Enclosures of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries’,  English Historical Review, Vol. 59, No. 235 ( 1944), p.400 The other counter-petitioners, led by villager William Huthwaite, described themselves as 'owners and proprietors of ancient houses having right of common'. They alleged that if the bill passed it would be prejudicial to their rights and properties and injurious to the public in general.  They successfully secured the appointment of an additional, fifth, commissioner, a local man George Padley of Calverton, to represent their interests.Ibid, p.402; Tate says 'John', but the actual Award is signed by a 'Geo. Padley' An Act for dividing and inclosing the open fields, meadows, pastures, commons, forest and waste grounds in the parish of Calverton in the County of Nottingham was passed by Parliament in May 1779.19 Geo. III, c.79 After a little over a year, on 7 July 1780, the commissioners were able to sign the award.  One hundred and seventy plots of land were allotted to nearly ninety owners.  Because about 2,334 acres of Calverton had been enclosed in such a short time, it seems very likely that much of the detail mentioned in the award had already  been agreed by the principal owners, and the work of the commissioners will have been to satisfy the claims of those villagers who perhaps owned no land at all, but did have common rights around the parish. These rights would be replaced, at enclosure, by small allotments of land. John Roe (q.v.) for example received just 11 perches, or about 330 square yards.Notts Archives:EA18/1/1,EA18/2 The principal landowners were now the prebends of Oxton, Revd James Bingham as vicar, the Duke of Portland, Margaret Sherbrooke, Elizabeth Bainbrigge and Thomas Smith.  There were many other smaller proprietors however, and because of this multiplicity of ownership, Calverton could not be described as a  'closed village’, where the property was in the hands of a few people who could control development and, for example, restrict people coming in who might become dependent on poor relief.For characteristics of 'open' and 'closed' villages see: D R Mills, Lord and Peasant in Nineteenth Century Britain (1980),p.117, table 6.1 The initial stimulus or spark to parliamentary enclosure is not clear.  As noted, it was not to reorganise the arable, but since the largest Calverton landowners were now the holders of the two prebends of Oxton, Hugh Thomas and John Marsden,  it may well have been prompted by them, so that the annual payment of tithes to the prebendaries could be changed into an allotment of land, and all tithes could be extinguished.TNA:IR 18/7356 Tithes extinguished Thereafter the land, that had been allotted, would provide an income to maintain the prebendaries, who served at Southwell Minster. The Duke of Portland would also have been a supporter of enclosure, since the Calverton villagers’ common right of breck agriculture must have been an irritation at a time when the ‘Dukeries’ were beginning to subsume the forest wastes.B. Cowell, ‘Parks, plebs and the picturesque: Sherwood forest as a contested landscape in later Georgian England, 1770-1830’ in  M. Agnoletti, S, Anderson (eds.,), Forest history: international studies on socio-economic and forest ecosystem change. Report No.2 of the IUFRO Task Force on Environmental Change (2000), pp.195-210 Enclosure meant that the system whereby land which was owned by one person, but over which other people had certain traditional or common rights, such as to allow their livestock to graze upon it, or to collect firewood, or collect sand and gravel was ended forever. The common right  of breck agriculture, which was peculiar  to forest villages, was also brought to an end. The landscape of the parish was also altered. Hedges were planted, drains dug, gates and stiles erected, footpaths and bridleways established in law and roads (sixty feet between the hedges) were laid out, so that today’s Calverton is recognisably as set down in the Award of July 1780. The village seems to have escape the worst of the Luddite disturbances in 1811-17, but a spirit of radicalism did exist, as Calverton was one of eleven Nottinghamshire villages (which also included Woodborough, Oxton and Lambley) that presented petitions to parliament in 1817 demanding electoral reform. The petitioners wished (in a foreshadowing of later Chartist demands), for annual elections of representatives chosen by ’all men who have attained the age of twenty-one… seeing that all men pay Taxes, and all men have lives and liberties to protect’.Journals of the House of Commons, 27 February 1817,p.118 At the time only male owners of property worth at least forty shillings were allowed to vote.  Limited electoral reform was not to come until 1832. (q.v.) By the time the first county directory was published in 1832, Calverton had grown to a ‘considerable village’ of 1,196 persons, of whom 270 were engaged in manufacturing, of one sort or another, forty-seven in retail and handicrafts and only thirty-seven were primarily employed as agricultural labourers.1831. Abstract to the Answers and Returns to the Population, 11 Geo IV. c.30,p.487   It was not  therefore a traditional English agricultural village, but one in which cottage industries, such as the making of hosiery, dominated. William White’s directory claimed nearly three hundred stocking frames were in use at the time.W. White, History, gazetteer, and directory of Nottinghamshire, and the town and county of the town of Nottingham (Sheffield, 1832), pp.665-6 Calverton’s principal resident was Lady Katherine Sherbrooke (1783-1856), the widow of Sir John Coape Sherbrooke (1764-1830) who had been Governor General of British North America and who had retired to live at Calverton Hall.Demolished in 1961,the Hall stood on the site of Old Hall Close,NG14 6PU Other residents included five shoemakers, four hosiery manufacturers, four shopkeepers, three butchers as well as blacksmiths, frame-smiths and tailors. The 1832 directory lists two pubs, the Admiral Rodney and the White Lion, as well as three beerhouses, perhaps recently opened as a result of the Beerhouse Act 1830.In the Nottinghamshire Archives there are alehouse keeper’s bonds dated 1822, for both The White Lion and The Rodney (sic): C/QD/LV/3/6/40-1 The Gleaner (sic) public house was not to make its first appearance, in a directory, until 1876. Its application, as a beerhouse (together with the Forest Tavern), for a spirit license having been refused in 1861.Nottinghamshire Guardian, Thursday, 5 September 1861,p.5; Issue 806 Partly as a result of disillusionment with the 1832 Reform Act, radicalism raised its head again in the shape of the People's Charter of 1838, as textile workers saw real electoral reform, which the Charter proposed, as a means whereby their standard of living might be improved.J.V.Beckett, 'Radical Nottingham' in J.V.Beckett (ed.), A Centenary History of Nottingham  (Stroud, 2006),p.301 One of the Nottinghamshire organisers of Chartism was a Calverton man called George Harrison (1798-1871) who was a farmer and Primitive Methodist preacher.M.R. Watts, The Dissenters: Volume II: The Expansion of Evangelical Nonconformity 1791-1859 (1995), p.515; But he appears in the 1841 census as a 43-year-old 'cottager'. He had already, in June 1835, strongly objected, at the annual vestry meeting, to the dissenters and ‘the parish at large’ supporting St. Wilfrid’s against their will, by means of the church rate.Nottingham Review and General Advertiser for the Midland Counties, 12 June 1835, p.3  It was this Harrison who invited the leader of the Chartists, Feargus O’Connor to Calverton on Monday 25 July 1842. It may have been thought that a meeting of Chartists was less likely to be broken up by the authorities in the countryside, than in the town of Nottingham. The Chartists’ own newspaper The Northern Star described, in extravagant terms, the arrival of O’Connor by train from Derby, and his progress in a carriage procession along Mansfield Road, picking up delegations from suburbs and villages along the way till at last, around 2 p.m., Calverton was reached.The Northern Star (Leeds), Saturday, 30 July 1842; Issue 246   O’Connor made a long speech at 'Bonner Pool' to a crowd, which the newspaper estimated at five thousand, and then a tea-party was served in a marquee ‘in a beautiful pasture bounded by a splendid wood’. There followed an evening of singing, dancing and games, during which time a supposed government spy was pointed out and questioned. O’Connor spent the night in Calverton and the following morning, he set out for more speech-making in Mansfield.ibid Four weeks later The Northern Star reported that, on Monday 22 and Tuesday 23 August 1842,  there had been skirmishes with the village constable and a general withdrawal of labour by workers in Calverton, but the Battle of Mapperley Hills, on that Tuesday 23 August, perhaps saw the zenith of Chartism in Nottinghamshire, and the working class began to focus instead on opposition to the Corn Laws and the high price of bread.The Northern Star (Leeds), Saturday, 27 August 1842; Issue 250; J.V.Beckett, p.303 The General Enclosure Act of 1845 had required that provision should be made at enclosure for the landless, in the form of 'field gardens' or allotments, limited to a quarter of an acre, and this will have been prompted by the fear of civil unrest amongst the poor.8 & 9 Vict. c.118,p.1398; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1845/118/pdfs/ukpga_18450118_en.pdf Calverton had already been enclosed, but there is evidence that in 1845 this ‘cottage garden system’ had just been introduced to the village, and that frame-workers were cultivating rented allotments.Farmer’s Magazine Vol 12, July-Dec 1845,p.397 In that year allotment tenants paid their first half–yearly rent to Calverton farmer Mr. William Ward, who provided them with a free supper, prepared by Samuel Fletcher at the White Lion.F. White, Directory and Gazetteer of Nottinghamshire  (Sheffield, 1853),p.483 Not only were the poor more likely to be happier having a stake in the land, but it was hoped that landowners would have to pay less in the form of the poor-rate, if landless workers in the village were able to grow their own food.Farmer’s Magazine, Ibid. In 1851, at the same time as the census (which had found 1,427 person in 302 houses), there was a census of ‘Accommodation and Attendance at Worship.’ This is often referred to as the ‘1851 Religious Census’ and it revealed both the popularity of religion and the variety of options, both established and nonconformist, for the prospective Calverton worshipper.  Samuel Oliver, vicar of St Wilfrid's parish church (q.v.) claimed an average attendance of forty-seven in the morning, 132 in the afternoon and 133 at evening service. The Methodists appeared to be a state of some disarray at the time. There was a Primitive Methodist Chapel, which had been erected about 1783 for the Calverton Roeite sect (q.v.), but had been taken over from them in 1848.Nottingham Review and General Advertiser for the Midland Counties, 25 February 1848, p.4 This building was used by the Reformed Methodists in the morning (seventy worshippers), as well as by the Primitive Methodists both in the afternoon (90) and in the evening (150). There was also a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, erected in 1815, which could muster only twenty-five in the evening; Matthew Shepherd, the steward, explained that the low number attending was due to ‘the agitation in the connexion having caused a division here’. The New Methodists had built a place of worship in about 1820, but had sold it the Baptists in 1832 and the minister, Samuel Ward, for the Particular Baptist Chapel, claimed a congregation of 120.The relatively recently formed Latter-day Saints (or Mormons ) held services in a building that was ‘not used exclusively for worship’ and the elder, Thomas Lester, claimed an average of forty in the afternoon and fifty-seven in the evening.The National Archives(TNA), HO 129/488, Calverton There was no mention of the Roeite sect (q.v.),  in the census, some thirty years after the death of its founder, John Roe, in 1823.  This religious census of 1851 was never repeated, not because of doubts about its accuracy, but probably because it was felt to have shown the popularity of the dissenters.K. D. M. Snell, P.S. Ell, Rival Jerusalems: The Geography of Victorian Religion (Cambridge, 2000), pp.51,451 Although the 1832 Reform Act had extended the franchise, only sixty male land-, or lease-holders out of Calverton’s population of 1,427, were eligible to vote in the South Nottinghamshire by-election of 1851 and twenty of them were not even residents of the parish. Two Calverton voters lived as far away as Bishops Waltham in Hampshire. Of the sixty eligible, just forty-six actually did vote. While Calverton voters preferred Sydney Pierrepont (the future Earl Manvers) to the tenant farmers’ candidate William Barrow of Southwell by twenty-eight to eighteen, it was actually the latter who was narrowly elected for the constituency.A full and impartial report of the proceedings connected with an election contest in South Nottinghamshire, February,1851 (Nottingham, 1851), p.31; Barrow got 1493 votes and Pierrepont 1482 Prior to 1800, education for the less well-off was generally restricted to the occasional charity school.  Calverton was fortunate to benefit from a bequest of a Nottingham hosiery manufacturer, and village native called Jonathan Labray, who died a bachelor in 1718. His trustees arranged to pay the master of a day school and to allow him use of a house and four tons of coal per year. In 1835, sixty two males were taught; some paid for by the endowment, and some by weekly payments of one penny for reading and one penny for writing.J. Curtis, A topographical history of Nottinghamshire (Oxford, 1844), pp.48-9; Although Revd. Pugh had claimed in 1743 that the school was not endowed.(q.v.) There was also another school where twenty-five girls were taught at the expense of their parents. An infant school was started in 1833 for forty-four males and thirty-seven females, supported by subscription and pennies per week. This school seems to have moved into a purpose-built structure at Burnor Pool in 1846 which became the National School in 1852.Parliamentary Papers, Accounts and papers relating to Education, Vol 42 (1835), p.715 Children not taught in these schools might have had some instruction in one of the three Sunday schools; one attached to St Wilfrid’s, one to the Methodists and the last to the Baptists.Ibid;TNA: HO 129/488 The earliest reference yet found to Calverton cricket was on Monday, 24 October 1836,  when neighbouring Woodborough  beat the village by 38 runs, in a two-innings match played at Woodborough (67 and 71, 50 and 50).Nottingham Review and General Advertiser for the Midland Counties, 28 October 1836,  p.2; The game will certainly have been played earlier, but this was the first time, yet found, that a match merited a mention in the local press. The first mention of cricket in Calverton (and the earliest scorecard), was on Monday, 30 September 1844, when members of the two brass bands of Calverton and Woodborough met each other, and the home side won by six wickets  (47 and 42, 41 and 49 for 4 ). The teams, including star player, Calverton tailor Cornelias Hind (aged 39), afterwards enjoyed a supper of roast beef at the Admiral Rodney.Nottingham Review and General Advertiser for the Midland Counties, 4 October 1844,  p.6; 1841 census, H.O.107/2128. Before football became popular, the cricket season ran from April to October and, at a time when stockingers and others could control their hours of work, Monday was a popular day for fixtures.Nottingham Evening Post, 19 July 1935 A Calverton Cricket Club had been formed by 1852, as there is a report of a club dinner at the Gleaner beerhouse on 'Whit-Tuesday' (8 June) of that year.Nottinghamshire Guardian, Thursday,10 June 1852, p.8 In July 1855 a match was played between a team consisting of eleven members of the Hind family, and the rest of the village. The village won by twenty runs.Nottinghamshire Guardian, 19 July 1855, p.8; Played on Monday the 16th, Village 84 runs, Hind XI 64 runs A second eleven is noted in 1856, and there is a scorecard of 1860, showing that a team of juniors beat Woodborough by eight runs.Nottinghamshire Guardian,Thursday, 23 October 1856, p.8; ibid, Thursday, 8 November 1860, p.8 Calverton's most celebrated Victorian cricketer was Wilfred Flowers (1856-1926) who was born in the village in December 1856, and who played in eight Test matches and in 442 first-class matches for Nottinghamshire.Nottingham Evening Post, Monday, 1 November 1926, p.1 In November 1880, by arrangement with the 6th Duke of Portland, Hucknall began to take a supply of water from a 200’ deep borehole, on the Old Rufford Road (A614), opposite the Watchwood Plantation. A pumping station sent  330 gallons per minute from the borehole, through six miles of eight-inch pipe, south-west to a reservoir at Hucknall which held 400,000 gallons. This allowed Hucknall to have twenty gallons of water per person per day,  and was at a time when Calverton was without any piped water at all (q.v.). Nottinghamshire Guardian, 26 November, 1880, p.5; Papplewick Pumping Station opened two years later in 1882, only about a mile away. The population of Calverton had risen dramatically since the start of the century (see table), but the hosiery industry was beginning to show signs of decline because of changes in fashion and because manually operated stocking frames were becoming outdated.Nottingham Evening Post, 9 March 1892, p.4 In Nottingham, the population increased because of  the rise of lace manufacture, more advanced  steam–powered frames,  and by migration from villages like Calverton, following the passing of the Nottingham Enclosure Act of 1845, which at last had permitted housing and industry in the former common fields of the town. In 1881 the census recorded, in a population of 1246, a total of 294 workers in clothes-making (everything from hosiery to hats, shawls and gloves), while ninety-six were engaged in agriculture.1881 Census of England and Wales,'Occupations of Males and Females in the Division and its Registration Counties' , sections: 7 Agriculture and 18 Dress In January 1898 Sir Charles Seely bought the Sansom Wood Estate in Calverton from the 6th Duke of Portland.Nottm. University Manuscripts Dept., Portland Collection,E12/6/7/1 The Seely family were coal owners and had bought the Babbington pits (Cinderhill, Broxtowe, Kimberley and Bulwell, inter alia) in 1870, so it is probable that the Calverton land purchase was intended for extractive, rather than agricultural purposes.Nottingham Review 26 August 1870 In May 1898 the Manchester Times noted that Sir Charles was renting 80 acres of land to the Parish Council for allotments, ‘at a trifle over 31 shillings’ (£1.55 per year) per acre, in addition to a recreation ground of four acres, at a nominal rent of 6d (2½ p).Manchester Times, 6 May 1898, p.8 By the time of the death of Victoria in 1901, the population of the parish had declined slowly to 1,159. The rural exodus of the nineteenth century slowed in the early twentieth, partly because of temporary prosperity in agriculture, and Calverton’s population fell slightly to 1,101 in 1911 and 1,040 in 1921 then rose to 1,058 in 1931.  There was no decennial census in 1941 because of the Second World War, but by 1951, at the end of the final decade in which Calverton could justly be called a rural village, the population had increased to 1,304 in 431 households.Census Enumerators’ Returns 1911,1921,1931,1951;J. V. Beckett, The East Midlands…  (Harlow, 1988), p.321 As noted above, Calverton  was without a supply of piped water and the existing supply was often insufficient for the village's population.  In addition, in dry seasons, it had to be carted long distances to water cattle.Sheffield Independent , 29 April 1899, p.8  In June 1900, Basford RDC accepted Sir Charles Seely’s offer to provide a water supply for Calverton. A reservoir, pumping station and caretakers’ house were to be built at his expense, and 10,000 gallons of water per day would be supplied to the village from a borehole, for £87 per year.Nottinghamshire Guardian, 02 June 1900 The reservoir was on the site of present-day Waterworks Cottage, off Longue Drive. The first reference to a Calverton football team, so far found, was in November 1903, when the draw was made for the second round of the Notts. Shield Competition and Calverton St. Wilfrid’s were drawn to play Carlton St. Paul’s at home. Nottingham Evening Post, 23 November 1903, p.5 In 1908 Calverton St. Wilfrid’s were disqualified from the Competition for multiple offences, including fielding four ineligible players, and the Secretary of the club, F. Dovey,  was suspended from playing or football management. F.Smith, H. Hind, J. Lee and L. Meads; Nottingham Evening Post, 31 December 1908, p.8 In the 1906 General Election, 346 (male) villagers were eligible to vote in the, erstwhile, Newark constituency, which was about 31% of the total Calverton population.‘Parliamentary Register of Nottinghamshire’  in Nottingham Evening Post, 10 December 1906 This is to be compared with the 60 villagers, or only 4%, who were eligible in 1851 (q.v.). The increase was a consequence of the Second and Third Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884. The poorest men were still unable to vote by reason of a property qualification, not abolished until 1918. The last census before the First World War had found 1,101 inhabitants in 275 households. Certain surnames predominated; there were 69 with the surname Meads, 63 were called Binch, 50 Cooper and 50 Worthington.  Villagers were soon being called up to fight in the war, and when the Calverton Co-op failed in their attempt to prevent William Meads from being conscripted, they were said to have lost their last male employee.Nottingham Evening Post , 17 April 1916 By the war’s end, Calverton had lost 33 men (over 6% of the male population); the names of the dead are listed on a memorial in the church.Marble memorial in St Wilfrid's Church. After the war, as a result of the ‘Homes Fit for Heroes’ campaign, a Housing Act was passed to allow the building of council housing. In 1920 Basford RDC made plans for houses in the village for rent, which would cost £1,300 to build. Calverton councillor Charles Collyer (1877-1953) was shocked at the price and pointed out that the average rent in the village was only 2s 6d (12½p) per week.Nottingham Evening Post , 13 July 1920 It is not known how many houses were built, but the population increased from 272 households in 1921 to 305 households in 1931, so perhaps less than thirty houses in the decade. Plans for a railway, to improve transport in the agricultural districts of Nottinghamshire, which would join Lowdham to a point near Blidworth, and which would serve Epperstone, Woodborough,  Calverton and Oxton were proposed in 1919 by the Notts. War Agriculture Committee.Nottingham Evening Post , 6 May 1919 Possibly because there was already a line from Rolleston to Mansfield, via Southwell, the plans came to naught. The 1930s brought significant change to the village. Electric light arrived in 1930, with the erection of just a dozen street lights in October of that year.C.Peck, A stroll through Calverton's past  (Calverton, 1989), pp.35-6  The supplier may have been the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Electric Power Company. By 1939 however the number of overhead electric cables was considered ‘a menace’, and requests were made that new ones should be routed underground.Nottingham Evening Post , 11 July 1939  In August 1932, Nottingham Corporation’s water engineer expressed disappointment that so few applications for mains water were being received from villages, because they appeared satisfied with their existing ‘unwholesome’ borehole supplies. In Calverton, where pipe-laying was nearly complete, only 125 had signed up for mains water, out of 308 houses.Nottingham Evening Post , 16 August 1932 In July 1935,  at a time when outdoor swimming was becoming nationally popular and lidos were being built by local councils,  the Spring Water Lido, a 75 feet by 30 feet outdoor pool, was opened on Moor Lane as a private enterprise by two village business men, Messrs. P. Bagguley and A. Roden. Equipped with a diving board, changing facilities and a café, the lido was fed by a natural spring delivering 300 gallons a minute.Nottingham Evening Post , 6 July 1935; the lido was actually built on a triangle of land which belongs to Woodborough parish. A Lido Social Club was formed in 1947 which, by 1950, had 1,100 members.Nottingham Evening Post , 20 March 1950. In June 1937 a new cricket pavilion was opened by James Seely (1901-1956) in the same week (as he noted), that he had attended the ceremony of ground-breaking in connection with the new colliery (q.v.). The cricket ground itself had been provided by his grandfather Sir Charles Seely in 1910.Nottingham Evening Post , 18 June 1937 Although it was in 1937 that the first shaft of the mine was sunk, it had been as early as 1910 that borings had taken place at Oxton, Thurgarton and elsewhere, to more accurately determine the extent of the concealed Nottinghamshire coalfield.  As a result of the borings, it was expected that coal could be worked profitably in the area, as was already being done at Gedling.Nottingham Evening Post,  16 December 1910 In 1921, George Spencer  of the Notts Miners Association had asserted that coal was ‘known to exist’ at Calverton.Nottingham Evening Post , 1 February 1921 Work started on the colliery in June 1937 with the Seely family’s Babbington Colliery Co. beginning the sinking of the shaft that would enable ventilation and ‘man-riding’ to the workings at Bestwood colliery.  In 1938, the Babbington Colliery Co. was taken over by the Bestwood Coal and Iron Company which was soon renamed B. A. Collieries Ltd.A.R. Griffin, Mining in the East Midlands 1550-1947 (1971), p.268 At about the same time Charles Collyer (who was by now chairman of both Basford Rural Council and the Calverton Parish Council,  as well as a Calverton poultry farmer) was in discussions with the Ministry of Health to borrow money to provide sewage disposal works for the village. At that time there were no disposal facilities at all, and the possibility that the mine owners, B.A. Collieries Ltd., might wish to build a colliery village of 500 houses and boost the population from an estimated 1,200, made the talks more urgent.Nottingham Evening Post , 14 October 1937  The 527m mine-shaft was completed early in 1939 and by September of that year, various buildings and twenty-two houses of a proposed colliery village had been built, to a design by Geoffrey Jellicoe. The Second World War then brought further work to an abrupt halt.NCB, National Coal Board, South Nottinghamshire Area, Calverton ; pamphlet (Nottingham, 1982?); Nottingham Evening Post , 18 March 1939 In 1940 the Trent Fishery Board, a precursor of the Trent River Authority, opened the Calverton Fish Farm with the aim of breeding thousands of fish to stock rivers and still waters around the country. The farm consisted of sheds containing hatching trays and sixty-three ponds in nine units of seven ponds each. The water supply to the ponds was from a spring,  by means of a borehole five hundred feet deep.Nottingham Evening Post, 20 June 1940, p.6;Ibid, 1 April 1941; the Trent Fishery Board had been established by the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act of 1923 In December 1941, some 12,000 fish, including carp and bream, were brought from the lake at Highfields park. The farm was already hatching out salmon and trout, and hoped to be fully stocked by 1942.Nottingham Evening Post , 16 December 1941 On 13 October 1940, a Fairey Battle aircraft of No. 300 Polish Bomber Squadron, then operating from RAF Winthorpe, was returning from a raid on Boulogne. Control of the aircraft was lost in fog, and it crashed in woods close to Whinbush Lane (). A memorial was subsequently erected to the three Polish airmen who were killed.Notts. County Council, Aviation in Nottinghamshire, Pamphlet (Nottingham, 2011). p.27 In the Second World War the village lost eight men, and their names appear on a brass memorial, in St Wilfrid’s Church (q.v.).viz; Gordon A. Bardill, W. Leslie Bagshaw, Victor H. Binch, J.M. Godfrey Browne, Bernard W, Grocock, Walter Perkins, Harry Sissons, Rowland Ullyatt. Work resumed on the mine after the war, and at the sinking of the new shaft in January 1946, B.A. Collieries Ltd. chairman Claude Lancaster M.P said that it was estimated that beneath the surface there might be 125 million tons of coal, which if one thousand men were to produce a million tons every year, would provide employment for 125 years.Times, 12 Jan 1946, p.2 This was to be the last privately sunk shaft, before the coal industry was nationalised on the 1 January 1947 and became the property of the National Coal Board (NCB). Since government plans to take the industry into public ownership were a Labour Party manifesto commitment of the post-war election, it seems possible that the sinking of the coal-winding shaft by B.A. Collieries Ltd,  before nationalisation, was to ensure the payment of compensation. In 1949 Councillor Collyer foresaw the development of Calverton from a village of 1,250 people to a ‘satellite town’ of 8,000 by 1960, and he said that the NCB were asking that two thousand miners be housed in the village.Nottingham Evening Post , 22 March 1949  The final depth of the new shaft was reached in June 1952 and, on 24 September of that year, Calverton Colliery was officially opened by the Minister for Coordination of Transport, Fuel and Power Lord Leathers.  After ventilation and other equipment had been installed, coal winding began in March 1953.NCB, pamphlet (Nottingham, 1982?) Following the colliery opening, two housing developments were created; the Colliery Estate bounded by Mansfield Lane, Crookdole Lane and Park Road East,  and the Council Estate bounded by Park Road, Lee Road and Flatts Lane. In the 1950s the population of Calverton rose sharply from 1,304 in 431 households in 1951, to 5,658 in 1,545 households in 1961.Census Enumerators’ Returns;1951,1961 This suggests that some 1,100 houses were built in the period. The Yorkshire Post reported, in February 1954, that collieries in the Mexborough area were being affected by men leaving for Calverton, because they had been promised new houses.Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer, 20 February 1954, p.7 The increase in population necessitated the rapid provision of more school places, and in 1955 Manor Park mixed primary school  was opened, followed by William Lee mixed junior school in 1956. In 1957 Colonel Frank Seely mixed secondary school was the next to open. When, in 1960, Sir John Sherbrooke junior school opened its doors, Manor Park became a school for infants only.C. Peck, A stroll through…, p.32 In the 1970s and early 1980s the colliery employed some 1,600 workers, but by 1988 this figure had fallen to 1,000, of whom 300 lived in the village. By September 1993, the number had been further reduced to 648, of whom 148 lived in Calverton.Calverton Parish Council, Our Village-Your Future, N.C.C. Quality Services Consultancy (Nottingham, 1995),p.7; But Hansard, 20 Dec 1994, vol 251, has 694 ‘men on books’ in November 1993 Traditional cottage-based frame-working had died out by the mid- twentieth century, but the link between the village and the hosiery industry was retained, through the presence of a Courtaulds factory on Main Street.  The destruction of this factory by fire in 1991, finally ended Calverton’s association with the textile industry.Calverton Conservation Area Appraisal , 15 December 2005 In 1992 British Coal (the successor to the NCB), had announced that the colliery would close, and in November 1993 it raised its offer of redundancy payments to £7,000 per man, on condition that the mine shut down immediately. This was to dissuade workers from opting for a review procedure which would delay matters. This offer was accepted, and the mine shut on 19 November.C.Critcher, et al, Out of the Ashes?: The Social Impact of Industrial Contraction and Regeneration on Britain's Mining Communities (2001), p.18 In December 1994 RJB Mining (now UK Coal) bought the core mining activities of the English coalfields from British Coal for £814 million and reopened four collieries, one of which was Calverton.D.W.Dixon-Hardy, I.G.  Ediz, ‘The UK coal industry since privatisation in 1995’  in: 17th International Mining Congress and Exhibition of Turkey (IMCET 2001), p.589 Less than five years later however, on 9 April 1999,  RJB Mining announced the closure of the colliery, citing ‘deteriorating geological conditions...(which)… have made it unviable’, and production of coal in the village finally ended, a week later, on 16 April.C.Critcher et al, Out of the Ashes…, p.22 In the 1960s, further housing had been built in the village, within the boundaries of Crookdole Lane, Bonner Lane, and Park Road East and by 1971 the village numbered 6,283. In the late 1970s and 1980s, there was more housing at the bottom of Bonner Hill and George’s Lane and by 2001 there were 6,903 inhabitants in 2,771 households.Calverton Parish Council, Our Village-Your Future… (Nottingham, 1995); Census Enumerators’ Returns;1971,2001 Since the closure of the colliery,  Calverton has assumed the character of a large commuter village. The 2011 census found 7,076 inhabitants in 2,987 households. A total of 76.8% of these households owned their accommodation outright, or with a mortgage or loan. This compares with 63.4% for England as a whole.2011 Census In April 2015, the High Court dismissed a legal bid by Calverton Parish Council to quash a ‘joint-core strategy’   drawn up by Nottingham City Council, Broxtowe Borough Council and Gedling Borough Council, in September 2014, with regard to the building of houses. The parish council had argued that the joint plan was based on a flawed report issued by an inspector, but the High Court said that the inspector had taken an approach that was ‘both sensible and appropriate’ in reaching an evidence-based conclusion that, in order to meet housing need for the area, some development on green belt land would be necessary. The effect of the ruling is to allow the plans of Gedling Borough Council, to build perhaps one thousand new homes in the parish up, to the year 2028.Nottingham Post , 22 April 2015; Calverton Parish Council v Nottingham City Council. Case Number: CO/4846/2014;  Greater Nottingham – Broxtowe Borough, Gedling Borough and Nottingham City - Aligned Core Strategies, September 2014 In consequence, by that time the population of Calverton parish might approach 9,500. St Wilfrid’s church seems to date, for the most part, from the fourteenth century, when it may have been reconstructed with material from an older building. The nave and tower were rebuilt in 1760-3 and over the west door is a commemorative stone ‘Mr. Pugh, Vicar, Saml. Pugh, Ino.Barrett, Church Wardens, Wm.Barrett, mason’. In 1835 the chancel was reconstructed and in 1881 the whole church was restored.Rev. A. Du Boulay Hill, ‘The Summer Excursion, 1908: Calverton church’, Transactions of the Thoroton Society, 12 (1908), pp.31-6; J.C. Cox, County Churches: Nottinghamshire (1912), p.53;N. Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Nottinghamshire, 2nd edition revised by E. Williamson (1979), p.89. An organ chamber was built in 1888 and an annexe in 1962. The nave has the somewhat unusual form of a wide parallelogram 42 feet 8 inches long and 37 feet 2 inches wide, of one span and with no traces of any arcades.  The chancel arch is not in the centre of the east wall of the nave, but about five feet nearer to the north side. This has led to the suggestion that when the building was rebuilt in the 1760s, the south wall of the nave was moved further south to enlarge the building.T. O. Hoyle,  A Guide to Calverton Parish Church (Calverton, 197-?), p.18 On the west wall of the ringing chamber,at second storey level, is a sandstone carving, on its side, of a man apparently digging, while on the west wall of the clock chamber,at third storey level, is a collection of nine sandstone panels believed to represent the occupations of the seasons. Seven of these stones are voussoir-shaped, and may have formed part of a band of ornament nine inches wide on the architrave of an arch in the earlier pre-fourteenth century building. Similar depictions of country activities may be seen on the fonts at   Burnham Deepdale in Norfolk, and Brookland in Kent. Carved into the capital of the north jamb is a small, 3" by 4", panel containing a three-quarter length depiction of a bearded bishop together with another figure. It is perhaps St Wilfrid himself,  either with a newly baptised convert or, as the freeing of slaves was a distinguishing feature of the bishop's career, in the act of manumission.D. Hill,  'Some Ancient Carved Stones in Calverton Church, Notts' in  Archaeological Journal , Vol 58 (1901), pp.459-63;Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland Although contemporary documentary evidence is lacking, the parish traditionally claims William Lee, inventor of the stocking frame, as its own. The Nottinghamshire historian Robert Thoroton asserted in his 1677 history of the county that Lee was a native of Calverton,R. Thoroton, Ibid while John Aubrey in his Brief Lives, written between 1669 and 1693, thought that he was born in Sussex;J. Aubrey,ed. J. Walker, Letters written by eminent persons … and ‘Lives of eminent men’ , vol.2 (1813), p.32 and Charles Deering in Nottinghamia Vetus et Nova, published in 1751, claimed that Lee was of Woodborough.C.Deering, Nottinghamia vetus et nova: or, An historical account of the ancient and present state of the town of Nottingham (Nottingham, 1751),p.99 Calverton’s claim is probably the strongest, as the Lee surname appears in parish registers of the time and a William Lee ‘the elder’, whose death was recorded in 1607, bequeathed a gold ring to his eldest son, William, who may have been the inventor.M. Grass and A. Grass, Stockings for a queen: the life of William Lee, the Elizabethan inventor (1967), pp. 159–161; Nottinghamshire Archives, PR/SW/34/16, Will (16/04/1607) of William LEE of Calverton, yeoman There is little evidence that William Lee was ever curate in the parish or even in Holy Orders. Aubrey appears to be first to describe him as a ‘poor curate’, while Thoroton only mentions a Cambridge M.A. degree, and even this is disputed.K. G.

Henson stated that he had got the greater part of his information about Lee from certain ‘ancient stocking makers’ who all gave a similar account, and that the authenticity of the story is ‘in some measure confirmed by the arms of the London Framework Knitters, which consist of a stocking-frame without the woodwork, with a clergyman on one hand and a woman on the other, as supporters.’ G. Henson, The Civil, Political and Mechanical History of the Framework Knitters in Europe, America &c(1831), pp.38-9,43,45-8 Some of the myths were made visual in Alfred Elmore's familiar oil painting of 1847, The Origin of the Stocking Loom in the Nottingham Castle Museum. There seems little doubt, however, that a William Lee did invent the stocking frame, since a partnership agreement between William Lee and George Brooke of 6 June 1600 exists in the archives of the Historical Manuscript Commission, and this agreement describes the invention.De Lisle and Dudley MS, no. 1234 (Foulis collection) and transcribed in: E. W. Pasold,  ‘In search of William Lee’, Textile History, 6 (1975), pp.12-16; George Brooke may be the conspirator who was executed in 1603. Failing to find much enthusiasm in this country for his ingenuity, Lee went to Rouen and set up stocking frames there, and is believed to have died in France, in obscurity,  in about 1615. By the end of the seventeenth century however, stocking frames, perhaps the most complex piece of machinery employed in the pre-industrial age, were in widespread use in England and elsewhere. The Roeites,  John Roe’s Society or Reformed Quakers (sometimes disparagingly, ‘Deformed Quakers’), were a group of dissenting Protestants, which married and buried its members, as the Quakers did, and which flourished for a while in Calverton.Tait's Edinburgh magazine, vol. 7 (1840) pp.432-3 Their original meeting house was a converted barn, close to the junction of Woods Lane and Dark Lane, where a large tree now stands. (). John Roe (1732–1823), who founded the sect, may have been of the same family as Robert Roe, the ‘oppressed Quaker’ of Epperstone, who had been in trouble in 1669 for holding illegal religious meetings, and of Richard Roe the clockmaker of the same village.Epperstone Date Book, page for year 1669, quoted in:  J. Gunn, A History of Epperstone, (2003), p.18 As early as 1759, John Roe had written about his religious beliefs and of his reactions to the preaching of dissenters who came to Calverton, but it was not until about 1780, when he was in his late forties, that he established his sect.The experience of John Roe: late minister of a society of Protestant dissenters in Calverton calling themselves reformed Quakers (1759, reprint in 1822), passim He may well have been prompted by unhappiness with the vicar James Bingham since, in 1778, he had been cited (as John Rooe (sic), basket-maker) for non-payment of tithes, together with Thomas Hinde, tailor, and Bartholomew Lee, farmer.Notts. Archives: SC/8/3/242-244 (1778) He must have been encouraged by the provisions of the recently passed Nonconformist Relief Act 1779 which freed dissenting ministers from the need to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, formerly required by the Act of Toleration 1689.www.theclergydatabase.org.uk, James Bingham The Roeites' presence in the village  evidently caused a degree of bad feeling, because Calverton schoolmaster Joseph Morley, writing to the Nottingham Journal in 1787, was moved to declare that:...their religion in short, is a heap of inconsistencies promiscuously jumbled together, and their preaching an invariable compound of railing, absurdity, billingsgate and blackguardism…John Roe, their founder, holds himself as the only true prophet since the days of the Apostles, and he bitterly inveighs against all denominations, and d--ns the world in a bag...and I need not hesitate to aver that the wickedness, blasphemy and abomination delivered from Roe’s pulpit are without parallel.Nottingham Journal, Saturday, March 31, 1787; Mr Morley will have been especially irked as the 1779 Act also permitted dissenting tutors and schoolmasters to teach, without needing to be licensed by the local Anglican bishop. A peculiarity of the group was the custom of marrying its members after partners had been selected, not by courtship, but by a jury of twelve drawing lots.  This was 'in order to know precisely the will of Heaven concerning their matrimonial union'.J.F. Sutton, The date-book of remarkable and memorable events connected with Nottingham and its neighbourhood, 1750-1850 (Oxford, 1852), p.178. The idea was so extraordinary that even the German poet and philosopher Friedrich von Schiller, in far-away Stuttgart, was moved to write about it, and lamented in a 1781 article, Arme jugend van Calverton!, about the lack of sentimentality and passion in the arrangement.' Poor Youth of Calverton !' in Nachrichten zum Nutzen und Vergnügen (Stuttgart, 31 July 1781), this was a twice-weekly newspaper edited by Schiller. The Roeites however contended that they had the right to marry, as well as to perform any religious duty, under the Act of Toleration 1689.Diary or Woodfall’s Register (London) , Wednesday, April 10, 1793; Issue 1265 The Marriage Act of 1753 had tightened the existing ecclesiastical rules, providing that for a marriage to be valid it had to be performed in a church and after the publication of banns. However, Jews and, crucially,  Quakers were seemingly exempted from its provisions (Catholics and other dissenting groups were not exempt), and it may be that John Roe believed, for this reason, that this Act did not apply to his 'Quaker-like' group. On 1 May 1780 John Roe went through a marriage ceremony, in the meeting house, with Isabel Morris, of the parish of St Mary, Nottingham. Later Elizabeth Morris (sister to Isabel) was similarly joined with Thomas Bush. On 20 April 1785 the churchwardens of St Wilfrids accused Isabel Morris (using her maiden name, rather than ‘Mrs Roe’), before the Church Court at Southwell Minster, of having three illegitimate children and Elizabeth Morris (‘Mrs Bush’) of having one such child.Notts. Archives:SC/8/2/430-432, Citation for appearance of Mabel Morris and Elizabeth Morris, both of Calverton, before Southwell Chapter on 21 October 1785, with related documents (10 Oct 1785) The ostensible reason must have been that the illegitimate offspring would become a burden on the parish.  The two mothers failed to appear at Southwell to answer the charges, and in February 1786 letters of excommunication against them were issued by the vicar, James Bingham.Notts. Archives: SC/8/2/434 and 5, Schedule and Mandate of excommunication of Mabel Morris and Elizabeth Morris, both of Calverton, for contumacy at not appearing before Southwell Chapter (24 Feb 1786 and 4 Mar 1786) On Sunday the 5 March the curate of Calverton, Ephraim Rogerson read out the order in church.Ibid; www.theclergydatabase.org.uk, Ephraim Rogerson As the two women did not apply to have the excommunication lifted within forty days, the Archbishop of York asked the Crown to issue writs of excommunicato capiendo to the Civil Courts to imprison the women, and they were taken to the county gaol, without any prospect of ever being released.Public Advertiser (London) , Tuesday, April 18, 1786; Issue 16195; Scots Magazine, vol 48, April 1786, p.204; Isabel is called Mabel in some sources. Although no child of the sect seems to have actually become chargeable to Calverton parish, ‘Mrs Roe’ and ‘Mrs Bush’ had effectively, been sentenced to life imprisonment in the Nottingham county gaol.  The matter had got out of hand, and reports began to appear in the press which expressed disquiet about the affair and the way in which the animosity between the dissenters and the Established Church was ‘disgraceful in this enlightened age’. It was reported that, in the village, neighbours set fire to the fences of the Roeites, interrupted their services by blowing horns and firing guns, killed John Roe's cow, 'broke his trees' and even threw dirt at the congregation when passing them in the street.Public Advertiser (London), Wednesday, May 28, 1788; Issue 16804 John Roe’s brother William wrote from Farnsfield to Lord George Gordon, of the Protestant Association, appealing for his help (Gordon had himself been excommunicated) and the M.P. John Courtenay, who was later to write Conduct of the Dissenters in England (1790), raised the matter in Parliament, as a general feeling of unease about the issue began to become apparent. Diary or Woodfall's Register, Ibid A legal counsellor in 1788 gave his opinion that if the writs had been correctly issued, there seemed no possibility of them being released from prison, unless their marriages could be made out to be Quaker, or their Roeite marriages could be made legal by a new Act of Parliament.Mr J. Mansfield, quoted in Diary or Woodfall's Register, Wednesday, 10 April 1793; Issue 1265. In August 1790 Lord Kenyon, the Lord Chief Justice said that they could be released if they did penance, but the two sisters were not at all penitent and refused.Public Advertiser (London), Tuesday, August 3, 1790; Issue 17495 Eventually,  in 1798 after twelve years imprisonment, it appears that  ‘Mrs Roe’ and ‘Mrs Bush’ were allowed to escape and return to Calverton, when part of the gaol was being rebuilt.K.G.T. Meaby, Nottinghamshire: Extracts from the county records of the eighteenth century (Nottingham, 1947), p.61,quoting from: J. Blackner, History of Nottingham (1815) The Quaker writer William Howitt attended one of John Roe's services, and described the converted barn amongst the orchards. A very plain chapel with loft, pulpit and seats (not at all like a Quaker meeting house, thought Howitt), and a congregation of thirty slumbering, while Roe, attended by Isabel, provided a 'droning commentary' on the transfiguration. W. Howitt, A Country Book: For the Field, the Forest, and the Fireside (1859), pp.77-84  John Roe, a small man with long white hair, combed in flowing locks on his shoulders, continued to preach in the converted barn, and died at the age of 91 in 1823.Tait's Edinburgh magazine, Ibid    The Roeite sect did not long survive the death of its founder and, although White’s Directory of 1844 reported a ‘small meeting house’, there was no mention of the sect  in the Religious Census of 1851.  W.White, History, Gazetteer and Directory of Nottingham (1844), p.545 The manorial history of Salterford is complicated and incomplete, and traces of any possible former settlement are not now evident, but its name is still represented, on larger scale maps, by Salterford Farm and by nearby Salterford Dam on the Dover Beck.() In the Domesday survey, it is recorded as belonging to Osbern son of Richard and being six bovates (perhaps 90 acres) of ‘waste’, which may have meant that it was uninhabited or uncultivated, or both.J Morris, (ed.),Domesday Book: Nottinghamshire (Chichester, 1977),   27,3 It is referred to in the 1330 Assize rolls as  Molendin de Salturford so that a watermill must have been built there by that time.J. E. B. Gover, A. Mawer and F. M. Stenton, The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire  (Cambridge, 1940), p.158; A watermill rather than a windmill, as the former were more common at this time and in any case windmills were usually sited on higher ground to catch the wind. In the early Tudor period it seems to have belonged to a family of landowners called Revell who sold the land, with a pond, to Thomas Hockynson (or Hutchinson) in 1551.National Archives: C 1/670/38, C 1/890/70-73; Notts Archives 157DD/2P/16/1 The 1589 perambulation of Sherwood Forest includes Salterford Dam as a landmark on the boundary of the royal hunting ground, so evidently the dam (or body of water confined by an embankment [OED]), was already there as a source of water for a mill by the Dover Beck.Notts Archives 157DD/P/2723 A correspondent of the Nottinghamshire Guardian writing in 1883 referred to a manor house at Salterford, said by Dr Thoroton to have been occupied by Sir Thomas Hutchinson (1587-1643) father of the roundhead Colonel John Hutchinson.R. Thoroton, revised by J. Throsby  The antiquities of Nottinghamshire,  (1790–96), vol. 2, p.42; Thoroton mentions a manor, but  not  a house The site of this manor house was supposed to have been ploughed up in the making of flood meadows by the 5th Duke of Portland (1800-1879).The correspondent may have meant water meadows The Revd T. Woollen Smith (vicar of Calverton) in replying to this correspondent referred to a scribbled note, of 1760, in the parish register, probably written by Revd Maurice Pugh.www.theclergydatabase.org.uk, Maurice Pugh There were two burials in June 1614 of women who had been (wrote Pugh),  …inhabitants of a house yt stood at Salterford Dam now a Rabit Warren 1760 it looks like some plague. There was a corn mill there and a manor house within a Mote near the Dam head the Mill below it some distance served wh Water by a cut from ye Dam.Nottinghamshire Guardian, 22 June 1883, p.2; 13 July 1883, p.2 Despite Pugh's assertion, the 1609 map of Sherwood Forest, while listing 'Mr Randall Barton' and 'Mr Hutchinson' as freeholders of both 'Saunterforde Manor' and 'Saunsham Woods', had showed no habitations or buildings of any kind.S.N. Mastoris and S.M. Groves, (eds.), Sherwood Forest in 1609,Thoroton Society, Record Series, XL (Nottingham, 1997), p.143 and map 14 In 1662 Colonel Hutchinson sold the manor of Salterford to William Willoughby of Hunsdon in Hertfordshire.Notts Archives DD4P/22/81-2 Five years later the manor (including ‘ground where a mill lately stood’) was sold to two London gentlemen and, soon after that,  in 1676 Humphrey Jennens, the ironmaster of Erdington, was authorised by the Sherwood Forest Court to enclose nearby Sansom Wood.Notts Archives DD/4P/22/84-5, DD/P/6/1/2/11 In January 1709 Charles Jennens (son of Humphrey and father of the celebrated Charles Jennens) sold the land to John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle.Notts Archives DD/4P/22/99-100 In July of that year Salterford was being rented to a warrener called John Bagulie of Blidworth.Notts Archives DD/2P/28/11 By 1716 Salterford belonged to Lord Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford, as it had evidently been bequeathed to his wife, who was the only child of the late Duke.Notts Archives DD/P/6/4/2/2  In 1721 Salterford was being leased at £20 p.a.  to Samuel Wilkinson of Calverton as a rabbit warren, with permission also to make brecks (q.v. ) to take three crops.Notts Archives DD/4P/76/19 It seems that Samuel Wilkinson was the son-in-law of the vicar, Revd Maurice Pugh and was receiving letters from him concerning the tithes for corn, sheep, and even rabbits, up to 1750.Notts Archives DD/4P/76/1-5 The enclosure map of 1780 shows that the vicar had been awarded the area at the junction of Salterford Lane and the Old Rufford Road, 'in lieu of tithes', while 'Sansome Warren' covered the area where now there are woods and ponds.Notts Archives EA18/1/1,EA18/2  The Revd T. Woollen Smith noted in 1883 that he had spoken to a man who, as a boy, ‘remembered… seeing remains of an old manor house when the present Salterford dam was being made'.Nottinghamshire Guardian , 22 June 1883, p.2; 13 July 1883, p.2 Salterford may well have originated as a place where salters used a ford, at a low-lying point on the trackway through the forest,  now known as the A614 or Old Rufford Road. It seems however to owe its continued existence in the records to the construction of a mill, at an early time, a few hundred metres away, at the point where the Dover Beck enters Calverton parish. It appears to be the only place in the parish where there was sufficient water power to turn the wheel of a mill and it is therefore to be associated with other ancient mills on that river, such as those formerly at Oxton, Epperstone and Gonalston.Notts Archives 157DD/P/2723  While there may have been a miller’s house, at Salterford, to accompany the water-mill, documentary evidence for a Manor House or settlement at the location is lacking. This may well have been simply a landholding, given a collective name in the taxation records, without a central, nucleated settlement ever having existed.But note that the gamekeeper's house on the, A614, Old Rufford Road (un-named in 1891), is called 'Salterford Manor' in the 1901 census, before becoming 'Salterford House' in 1911: Source, Census Enumerators' Returns, 1891-1911 At the 2011 census, the parish of Calverton had a resident population of 7,076, of whom, according to the Office for National Statistics: Trent Barton Nottingham City Transport Year Population 1801 636 1811 904 1821 1064 1831 1196 1841 1339 1851 1427 1861 1372 1871 1319 1881 1246 1891 1199 1901 1159 Calverton (parish) Gedling (Non-Metropolitan District) England  Age Median age 43 42 39    Under 18 20.3% 20.5% 21.4%   Over 65 18.4% 17.0% 16.4%  Ethnic group    White British 97.0% 90.3% 79.8%    White Other 1.1% 2.7% 5.7%    Mixed/Multiple 1.0% 2.3% 2.2%    Asian or British Asian 0.7% 3.0% 7.7%   Black or Black British 0.1% 1.4% 3.4%   Other ethnic group 0.0% 0.3% 1.0%   Religion   Christian 62.9% 57.1% 59.4%   Buddhist 0.2% 0.3% 0.5%   Hindu 0.3% 0.5% 1.5%   Jewish 0.0% 0.1% 0.5%    Muslim 0.2% 1.4% 5.0%    Sikh 0.1% 0.6% 0.8%   Another religion 0.3% 0.3% 0.4%    No religion 29.3% 32.7% 24.7%    Did not answer 6.7% 7.1% 7.2% Calverton Connection: Nottingham - Sherwood - Daybrook - Arnold - Calverton 47: Nottingham - Mapperley - Lambley - Woodborough - Calverton - Epperstone - Lowdham - Gunthorpe 47B: Nottingham - Mapperley - Lambley - Woodborough - Calverton Calverton Parish Council Calverton Twinning Association Calverton Medical Practice
