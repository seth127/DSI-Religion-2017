   Mississippi () is a state located in the Deep South of the United States. Jackson is the state capital and largest city. The state's name comes from the Mississippi River, which flows along its western boundary, and takes its name from the Ojibwe word misi-ziibi ("Great River"). The state is heavily forested, and produces a majority of American catfish.http://msucares.com/aquaculture/catfish/ Mississippi is also known for its state symbol, the Magnolia. Mississippi is bordered on the north by Tennessee, on the east by Alabama, on the south by Louisiana and a narrow coast on the Gulf of Mexico, and on the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and Arkansas. Major rivers in Mississippi, apart from its namesake, include the Big Black River, the Pearl River, the Yazoo, the Pascagoula, and the Tombigbee. Major lakes include Ross Barnett Reservoir, Arkabutla Lake, Sardis Lake and Grenada Lake.  The state of Mississippi is entirely composed of lowlands, the highest point being Woodall Mountain, in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, only 806 feet (246&nbsp;m) above sea level. The lowest point is sea level at the Gulf coast. The Mean Elevation in the state is 300 feet (91&nbsp;m) above sea level. Most of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain. The Coastal Plain is generally composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills. The Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations. Yellow-brown loess soil is found in the western parts of the state. The northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the Alabama Black Belt. The coastline includes large bays at Bay St. Louis, Biloxi and Pascagoula. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the shallow Mississippi Sound, which is partially sheltered by Petit Bois Island, Horn Island, East and West Ship Islands, Deer Island, Round Island and Cat Island. The northwest remainder of the state is made up of a section of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, also known as the Mississippi Delta.  The Mississippi Alluvial Plain is narrow in the south and widens north of Vicksburg. The region has rich soil, partly made up of silt which had been regularly deposited by the floodwaters of the Mississippi River. Areas under the management of the National Park Service include: Mississippi has a hot humid subtropical climate with long summers and short, mild winters. Temperatures average about 82 °F (about 28 °C) in July and about 48 °F (about 9 °C) in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer, but in winter the region near Mississippi Sound is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from -19 °F (-28.3 °C), in 1966, at Corinth in the northeast, to 115 °F (46.1 °C), in 1930, at Holly Springs in the north. Yearly precipitation generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, Clarksdale, in the northwest, gets about 50 inches (about 1,270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually and Biloxi, in the south, about 61 inches (about 1,550&nbsp;mm). Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi, although snow is not unheard of around the southern part of the state. In the late summer and the fall, the state (especially the southern part) is often affected by hurricanes moving north from the Gulf of Mexico, and occasionally impacted by major hurricanes, which can be quite devastating in coastal communities. Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to coastal Mississippi, around the areas of Gulfport, Biloxi, and Pascagoula. Like the rest of the Deep South, Thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the southern part of the state. On average, Mississippi has around 27 tornadoes annually with the northern part of the state more vulnerable earlier in the year and the southern part more vulnerable later in the year. Mississippi is heavily forested, with over half of the state's area covered by wild trees; mostly pine, but also cottonwood, elm, hickory, oak, pecan, sweetgum and tupelo. Lumber is  a prevalent industry in Mississippi. Due to seasonal flooding possible from December to June, the Mississippi River created a fertile floodplain in what is called the Mississippi Delta, including tributaries. Early planters used slaves to build levees along the Mississippi River to divert flooding. They built on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt pushed up in flooding. As cultivation of cotton increased in the Delta, planters hired Irish laborers to ditch and drain their land. The state took over levee building from 1858-1861, accomplishing it through contractors. In those years planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land.David R. Roediger, The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class.New York: Verso, 1999, p.146 Before the war, the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached twenty feet.  Flooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history. It took a toll during the years after the Civil War. Major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882, regularly overwhelming levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war, and those repaired or constructed after the war.  In 1877 the Mississippi Levee District was created for southern counties. In 1879 the US Congress created the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included aiding levee boards in the construction of levees. Both white and African-American transient workers built the levees in the late 19th century. By 1882 levees averaged seven feet in height, but many in the southern Delta were severely tested by the flood.John Otto Solomon,The Final Frontiers, 1880-1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1999, pp.10-11 The levee system was expanded after the flood of 1882.  By 1884 the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee District was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern Delta counties.The New York Times, The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee Board: Physical development of a levee system, accessed 11/13/2007 Flooding overwhelmed northwestern Mississippi in 1912-1913, causing heavy financial costs to the levee districts. Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide Federal matching funds for local levee districts, on a scale of 2:1. Although US participation in World War I interrupted funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet in the 1920s.John Otto Solomon,The Final Frontiers, 1880-1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1999, p.50 Nonetheless, the region was severely flooded and suffered millions of dollars in damages due to the Great Flood of 1927.  Property, stock and crops were all lost. In Mississippi, most damage was in the lower Delta, including Washington and Bolivar counties.John Otto Solomon,The Final Frontiers, 1880-1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1999, p.70   Nearly 10,000 BCE Native American or Paleo-Indians appeared in the what today is referred to as the South.    Paleoindians in the South were fairly generalized hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that soon became extinct following the end of the Pleistocene age. After  thousands of years the Paleoindians would develop a highly rich agricultural society. Archeologist would call these people the Mississippians of the Mississippian culture; descendant Native American tribes include the Chickasaw and Choctaw. Other tribes who inhabited the territory of Mississippi (and whose names became those of local towns) include the Natchez, the Yazoo, and the Biloxi. The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of Hernando de Soto, who passed through in 1540. The first settlement was Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi) at Ocean Springs, settled by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in April 1699. In 1716, Natchez was founded on the Mississippi River (as Fort Rosalie); it became the dominant town and trading post of the area. After spending some time under Spanish, British, and French nominal jurisdiction, the Mississippi area was deeded to the British after the French and Indian War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763). The Mississippi Territory was organized on April 7, 1798, from territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina.  It was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the U.S. and Spain. Land was purchased (generally through unequal treaties) from Native American tribes from 1800 to about 1830. Mississippi was the 20th state admitted to the Union, on December 10, 1817. When cotton was king during the 1850s, Mississippi plantation owners&mdash;especially those of the Delta and Black Belt regions&mdash;became increasingly wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market, and their assets in slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor, and the severe wealth imbalances among whites played heavy roles in both state politics and in the support for secession. By 1860 the enslaved population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the state's total of 791,305.  There were fewer than 1000 free people of color.http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser The relatively low population of the state before the Civil War reflected the fact that much of the state was still wilderness and needed more settlers for development. Mississippi was the second state to secede from the Union as one of the Confederate States of America on January 9, 1861. During the Civil War the Confederate States were defeated. During Reconstruction the first constitutional convention in 1868 framed a constitution whose major elements would last for 22 years. The convention was the first political organization to include colored representatives, 17 among the 100 members. Although 32 counties had Black majorities, they elected whites as well as Blacks to represent them. The convention adopted universal suffrage; did away with property qualifications for suffrage or for office, which benefited poor whites, too; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting of civil rights in travel.W.E.B. DuBois,Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1880. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p.437 Under the terms of Reconstruction, Mississippi was readmitted to the Union on February 23, 1870. While Mississippi typified the Deep South in passing Jim Crow laws in the early 20th century, its history was more complex than just discrimination. Because the Mississippi Delta contained so much fertile bottomland which had not been farmed, after the Civil War African Americans achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in those areas. Tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the Delta.  In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining ownership of land. By the turn of the century, two-thirds of the farmers (in numbers) in Mississippi who owned land in the Delta were African American and seemed headed for having a stake in the future. Many were able to keep going through the difficult years of falling cotton prices by extending their debts. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, however, numerous African American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts and lost the land they had put so much labor into.John C. Willis, Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000 Constitutional disfranchisement of African Americans at the turn of the century, a series of increasingly restrictive racial segregation laws enacted during the first part of the 20th century, increased lynchings, failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation, and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913 resulted in tens of thousands of African Americans leaving Mississippi to migrate north starting during World War I. With the Great Migration, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters expanded their ownership of Delta backcountry and could take advantage of new railroads. By 1910 a majority of black farmers in the Delta were sharecroppers, and by 1920, the third generation after freedom, African Americans were mostly landless laborers facing inescapable poverty. Most migrants from Mississippi took the trains north to Chicago. Another wave of migration started in the 1940's. Almost half a million people left Mississippi in the second migration, three-quarters of them black. Mississippi generated rich, quintessentially American music traditions: gospel music, country music, jazz, blues, and rock and roll, all were invented, promulgated, or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians, and most came from the Mississippi Delta.  Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago, where it became part of that city's jazz and blues. The state's complex history has generated great storytellers.  Mississippi is noted for award-winning twentieth-century authors native to or associated with the state, including Nobel Prize-winner William Faulkner, playwright Tennessee Williams, Eudora Welty, Richard Wright, Ellen Douglas, Walker Percy, Willie Morris, historian Shelby Foote, Margaret Walker, Ellen Gilchrist, Alice Walker, and playwright Beth Henley. Mississippi was a center of activity during the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Students and community organizers from across the country came to help register voters and establish Freedom Schools. Resistance and harsh attitudes of many white politicians (including the creation of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission), the participation of Mississippians in the White Citizens' Councils, and the violent tactics of the Ku Klux Klan and its sympathizers, [ ] gained Mississippi a reputation in the 1960s as a reactionary state.[ ] In 1966 the state was the last to repeal prohibition of alcohol. In 1995 it symbolically adopted the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery. These amendments were still in effect in Mississippi even before their ratification there. On August 17, 1969, Category 5 Hurricane Camille hit the Mississippi coast, killing 248 people and causing US$1.5 billion in damage (1969 dollars). On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina, though a Category 3 storm upon final landfall, caused even greater destruction across the entire  of Mississippi Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama. On August 30, 2007, a report by the United States Census Bureau indicated that Mississippi is the poorest state in the country. Many white cotton farmers have large, mechanized plantations, some of which receive extensive Federal subsidies, yet many African Americans still live as poor, rural, landless laborers. The state had a median household income of $34,473. As of 2005, Mississippi has an estimated population of 2,921,088, which is an increase of 20,320, or 0.7%, from the prior year and an increase of 76,432, or 2.7%, since the year 2000.  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 80,733 people (that is 228,849 births minus 148,116 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 75 people into the state.  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 10,653 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 10,578 people. Mississippi has the largest African American population of any U.S. state. It currently stands at about 37% of the population. The Census Bureau considers race and Hispanic ethnicity to be two separate categories. These data, however, are only for non-Hispanic members of each group: non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, etc. For more information on race and the Census, see here. Until the 1930s, African Americans made up a majority of Mississippians. Due to the Great Migration, the state's African American population declined.  It is the highest proportion of state population in the nation (not counting the District of Columbia). Recently it has begun to increase again, due mainly to a higher birth rate than the state average. In many of Mississippi's public school districts, a majority of students are black. [ ] Blacks are a majority in the northwestern Yazoo Delta, the southwestern, and the central parts of the state, chiefly areas where they owned land as farmers or worked on cotton plantations and farms. More than 98% of the white population of Mississippi is native born, predominantly of British and Celtic descent. According to the 2000 census, the largest ancestries are: People of French Creole ancestry form the largest demographic group in Hancock County on the Gulf Coast. The African American; Choctaw, mostly in Neshoba County; and Chinese segments of the population are also almost entirely native born. Although some ethnic Chinese were recruited as indentured laborers from Cuba during the 1870s and later 19th c., the majority immigrated directly from China to Mississippi between 1910-1930.  While planters first made arrangements with the Chinese for sharecropping, most Chinese soon left that work. Many became small merchants and especially grocers in towns throughout the Delta.[www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/asianamerican/vivian-wong.html, Vivian Wu Wong,Magazine of History, "Somewhere between White and Black: The Chinese in Mississippi", v10, n4, pp33-36, Summer 1996, accessed 11/15/2007] According to recent statistics, Mississippi leads the country in the growth of immigrants. For three years in a row over 30 percent of Mississippi's residents have been classified as obese. In the most recent (2006), 22.8 percent of its children were also classified as obese. This makes Mississippi the most overweight U.S. state.  In response to a murder and legislation to ban same-sex couples in the state from adopting children, a statewide gay rights organization was formed in March of 2000. First called Mississippi Gay Lobby, it changed its name in 2001 to the more inclusive Equality Mississippi. The United States 2000 Census counted 4,774 same-sex couple households in Mississippi.Gay Demographics 2000 Census DataCensus.gov: Married-Couple and Unmarried-Partner Households 2000 Mississippi was one of three states - the others being South Dakota and Utah - that had 40 percent or more of these same-sex couple households having at least one own child living in the household.Census.gov: Married-Couple and Unmarried-Partner Households 2000 Of Mississippi’s same-sex couples, 41% have one or more children. This figure is higher in Mississippi than in any other state. Further, Mississippi has a larger percentage of African American same-sex couples among total households than does any other state. Additionally, Mississippi ranks number 5 in the nation in the percentage of Hispanic same-sex couples among all Hispanic households. Mississippi ranks number 9 nationally among states with the highest concentration of same-sex couples who are seniors.Facts and Findings from The Gay and Lesbian Atlas Jackson, the state capital, ranks number 10 in the nation in concentration of African-American same-sex couples.Facts and Findings from The Gay and Lesbian Atlas In 2004, Mississippi voters overwhelmingly approved a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage by 86%, the largest proportion of any state. The amendment also prohibits Mississippi from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other states and countries, where it may be legal.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Mississippi's total state product in 2006 was $84 billion. Per capita personal income in 2006 was only $26,908, the lowest per capita personal income of any state, but the state also has the nation's lowest living costs. Although the state has one of the lowest per capita income rates in the United States, Mississippians consistently rank as one of the highest per capita in charitable contributions.Generosity Index Before the Civil War, Mississippi was the fifth-wealthiest state in the nation., The New York Times Travel Almanac (2004)  Slaves were then counted as property and the rise in the cotton markets since the 1840s had increased their value. A majority - 55 percent - of the population of Mississippi was enslaved in 1860.[ttp://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/sate.php Historical Census Browser] Largely due to the domination of the plantation economy, focused on the production of one agricultural good, cotton, the state was slow to use its wealth to invest in infrastructure such as public schools, roads and railroads. Industrialization also did not spread from northern climates until the late 20th century. The planter aristocracy, the elite of antebellum Mississippi, kept the tax structure low for themselves and made private improvements. The most successful planters, such as Confederate President Jefferson Davis, owned riverside properties along the Mississippi River. During the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi men were killed, and many more were left crippled and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth. In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi had been more than $500 million of which $218 million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177 million.W.E.B. DuBois,Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1880. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p.432 Poor whites and landless freed blacks suffered the most from the depression that followed the Civil War. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes.Du Bois, Ibid., p.437 It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.Du Bois, Ibid., p.432 and 434 By 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, but two decades later the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell off their farms to pay off accumulated debts.John C. Willis, Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000 Mississippi's rank as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton agriculture before and after the Civil War, late development of its frontier bottomlands in the Mississippi Delta, repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century requiring massive capital investment in levees, heavy capital investment to ditch and drain the bottomlands, and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities.John Otto Solomon,The Final Frontiers, 1880-1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1999, pp.10-11, 42-43, 50-51, and 70 The 1890 constitution discouraged industry, a legacy that would slow the state's progress for years.V.S. Naipaul, A Turn in the South. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989  From Democratic militias and groups such as the White Camellia terrorizing African American Republicans to take political control in the 1870s, to the legislature passing segregation and disfranchisement legislation, the state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of crops due to the devastation of the boll weevil in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912-1913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.John Otto Solomon,The Final Frontiers, 1880-1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1999, pp.10-11, 42-43, 50-51, and 70 It was not until 1884, after the flood of 1882, that the state created the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and started successfully achieving longer term plans for levees in the upper Delta.The New York Times, The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee Board: Physical development of a levee system, accessed 11/13/2007 Despite the state's building and reinforcing levees for years, the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 broke through and caused massive flooding of  throughout the Delta and millions of dollars in property damages. With the Depression coming so soon after the flood, the state suffered badly during those years. Tens of thousands of people migrated north for jobs and chances to live as full citizens. The legislature's 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast has led to economic gains for the state. An estimated $500,000 per day in tax revenue was lost following Hurricane Katrina's severe damage to several coastal casinos in August 2005. Gambling towns in Mississippi include the Gulf Coast towns of Bay St. Louis, Gulfport and Biloxi, and the Mississippi River towns of Tunica (the third largest gaming area in the United States), Greenville, Vicksburg and Natchez. Before Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, Mississippi was the second largest gambling state in the Union, after Nevada and ahead of New Jersey. On October 17, 2005, Governor Haley Barbour signed a bill into law that now allows casinos in Hancock and Harrison counties to rebuild on land (but within  of the water).  The only exception is in Harrison County, where the new law states that casinos can be built to the southern boundary of U.S. Route 90. Mississippi collects personal income tax in three tax brackets, ranging from 3% to 5%. The retail sales tax rate in Mississippi is 7%. Additional local sales taxes also are collected. For purposes of assessment for ad valorem taxes, taxable property is divided into five classes. Mississippi is served by eight interstate highways: and fourteen main U.S. Routes: as well as a system of State Highways. Two further interstate highways are proposed: Interstate 69 and Interstate 269. For more information, visit the Mississippi Department of Transportation website.  Amtrak provides scheduled passenger service along two routes. Canadian National Railway's Illinois Central Railroad subsidiary provides north-south service. The BNSF Railway has an east-west line across northern Mississippi. Kansas City Southern Railway provides east-west service in the middle of thee state and north-south service along the Alabama state line. Norfolk Southern Railway provides service in the extreme north and southeast, while CSX has a line along the Gulf Coast. The following airports in Mississippi currently have scheduled air service: Of these airports, Gulfport-Biloxi, Jackson and Tupelo are the only airports to have daily scheduled service to multiple destinations; the remaining airports only have non-stop service via commuter aircraft to either Northwest Airlines' hub at Memphis International Airport or Delta Air Lines' hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Northwestern Mississippi is also served by Memphis International Airport. As with all other U.S. states and the federal government, Mississippi's government is based on the separation of legislative, executive and judicial power. Executive authority in the state rests with the Governor, currently Haley Barbour (Republican). The Lieutenant Governor, currently Phil Bryant (Republican), is elected on a separate ballot. Both the governor and lieutenant governor are elected to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the heads of major executive departments are elected by the citizens of Mississippi rather than appointed by the governor. Mississippi is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years (The others are Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Virginia). Mississippi holds elections for these offices every four years in the years preceding Presidential election years.  Thus, the last year when Mississippi elected a Governor was 2007, and the next gubernatorial election will occur in 2011. (See: List of Governors of Mississippi) (See: List of Lieutenant Governors of Mississippi) (See: List of State Treasurers of Mississippi) (See: List of Attorneys-General of Mississippi) (See: Mississippi general election, 2007) Legislative authority resides in the state legislature, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate, while the House of Representatives selects their own Speaker.  The state constitution permits the legislature to establish by law the number of senators and representatives, up to a maximum of 52 senators and 122 representatives. Current state law sets the number of senators at 52 and representatives at 122.  The term of office for senators and representatives is four years. (See: List of U.S. state legislatures.) Supreme judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court, which has statewide authority.  In addition, there is a statewide Court of Appeals, as well as Circuit Courts, Chancery Courts and Justice Courts, which have more limited geographical jurisdiction. The nine judges of the Supreme Court are elected from three districts (three judges per district) by the state's citizens in non-partisan elections to eight-year staggered terms. The ten judges of the Court of Appeals are elected from five districts (two judges per district) for eight-year staggered terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected to four-year terms by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction. Mississippi has two U.S. senator seats. One is currently held by Thad Cochran (Republican) and the other is held by Roger Wicker (Republican) as he was appointed on December 31, 2007 by Mississippi governor Haley Barbour due to Trent Lott resigning on December 18, 2007. Wicker will serve until an election is held for the remainder of Lott's unexpired term (see United States Senate special election in Mississippi, 2008). As of the 2001 apportionment, the state has four congressmen in the U.S. House of Representatives, currently Chip Pickering (Republican), Bennie Thompson (Democrat), Gene Taylor (Democrat), and an open seat that was held by Roger Wicker before his appointment to the Senate (see Mississippi's 1st congressional district special election, 2008). (See: List of United States Representatives from Mississippi; Congressional districts map) Mississippi, like the rest of the South, long supported the Democratic Party. The policies of Reconstruction, which included federally appointed Republican governors, led to white Southern resentment toward the Republican Party. Following the Compromise of 1877, federal troops enforcing the provisions of Reconstruction were pulled out of the South. The Democratic Party regained political control of the state, using methods designed to suppress black voter turnout, which had understandably favored  Republican candidates. In 1890 the Mississippi legislature was the first in the South to use a grandfather clause law to prevent freedmen from voting. After the law was declared unconstitutional, the state passed bills requiring voters to pay a poll tax and pass literacy tests as created by local boards. By 1900 these measures effectively disfranchised the vast majority of African Americans in the state. Not until 1966, following the passage of the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, would most African American men, and by then women, have the chance to vote. For 116 years (from 1876 to 1992), Mississippians only elected Democratic governors. Over the same period, the Democratic Party dominated  state and federal elections in Mississippi. However, since the 1960s the Republican Party has become competitive in statewide elections.  In recent years, it has become dominant in the state's federal elections, carrying the state's electoral votes in every election since 1980. Jimmy Carter was the last Democratic nominee to win in Mississippi, when he narrowly carried the state in 1976 by only two percentage points. Mississippi has elected Republican nominees 9 out of 11 times in presidential elections since 1964. Mississippi will host its first ever presidential debate when the party nominees face off on the University of Mississippi campus September 26, 2008.The Clarion-Ledger: University lands first of 3 debates; Accessed November 20, 2007 Mississippi has 82 counties. Citizens of Mississippi counties elect the members of their county Board of Supervisors from single-member districts, as well as other county officials. (See: List of counties in Mississippi) On some social issues, Mississippi is one of the more conservative states in the US, with religion often playing a large role in citizens' political views. Liquor laws are particularly strict and variable from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Liquor sales are frequently banned on Sunday. Many cities and counties allow no alcoholic beverage sales ("dry"), while others allow beer but not liquor, or liquor but not beer. Some allow beer sales, but only if it is not refrigerated.Proposed New Ordinances, Oxford, Mississippi; note section 5-23 paragraph (b), which states in part, "It shall be unlawful in the City of Oxford, Mississippi, for any owner, proprietor, manager or employee of any establishment which has a permit or privilege license authorizing the sale of light wine or beer at retail to... Sell, give or dispense or permit to be consumed any light wine or beer which has been refrigerated." In 2001, Mississippi banned adoption by same-sex couples and banned recognition of adoptions by same-sex couples which were done and recognized in other states or countries. In 2004, 86% of voter turnout amended the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage and ban state recognition of same-sex marriages which were done and recognized in other states and countries. At the same time, Mississippi has been one of the more innovative states in the country, having been the first state to implement a sales tax and the first state to pass a Married Women's Property Act.

The first school for blacks was established in 1862. During Reconstruction in 1870, black and white Republicans were the first to establish a system of public education in the state. The state's dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation  limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools.  As late as the early 20th century, there were few schools in rural areas. With seed money from the Julius Rosenwald Fund, many rural communities across Mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for African-American children, under the management of white school boards.  Essentially, many African Americans taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of their children.James D. Anderson,The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1988, pp.160-161 Blacks and whites attended separate public schools in Mississippi until the 1960s, when they began to be integrated following a 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that racially segregated public schools were unconstitutional. Population settlement patterns have resulted in many districts that are de facto segregated. In the late 1980s, the state had 954 public elementary and secondary schools, with a total yearly enrollment of about 369,500 elementary pupils and about 132,500 secondary students. Some 45,700 students attended private schools. In 2004, Mississippi was ranked last among the fifty states in academic achievement by the American Legislative Exchange Council's Report Card on Education, with the lowest average ACT scores and spending per pupil in the nation. In 2007, Mississippi students scored the lowest of any state on the National Assessments of Educational Progress in both math and science., The New York Times (2007)  (see: List of colleges and universities in Mississippi) Mississippi has been historically significant in the development of the blues, especially the Delta region. Mississippi blues greats include: Bo Carter, Son House, Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, Muddy Waters, Skip James, Bukka White, Tommy Johnson, Mississippi John Hurt, Willie Brown, Big Joe Williams, Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King, John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Reed, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Big Bill Broonzy, Jimmy Rogers, Bo Diddley, Otis Rush, Otis Spann, and B. B. King. Jimmie Rodgers, a white guitarist/singer/songwriter, known as the "Godfather of Country," also played a significant role in the development of the blues. He and Chester Arthur Burnett were friends and admirers of each other's music. Rodgers was supposed to have given Burnett his nickname of Howlin' Wolf. This friendship and respect is an important example of Mississippi's musical legacy. While the state has had a reputation for being the most racist in America, it also played a significant role in the integration of American music.  Its musicians created a creolization by  combining musical traditions from Africa with the musical traditions of white Southerners, a tradition largely rooted in Celtic music. The Mississippi Blues Trail, now being implemented, has dedicated markers for historic sites, such as Clarksdale's Riverside Hotel, where Bessie Smith died after her auto accident on Highway 61. The Riverside Hotel is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale. Located in Clarksdale, the Delta Blues Museum is visited by people from all over the world. Close by are Ground Zero and Madidi, a blues club and restaurants co-owned by actor Morgan Freeman. Mississippi has been fundamental to the development of American music has a whole. Elvis Presley was a native of Tupelo, Mississippi. While its origins were based more in Tennessee than Mississippi, country music had its first superstar in Jimmie Rodgers, a native of Meridian. From the famous alternative rock band 3 Doors Down to famous gulf and western singer Jimmy Buffett, Mississippi has had a long and proud music history. (see: List of people from Mississippi)  Mississippi has produced a number of notable and famous individuals, especially in the realm of music and literature.

This led to the development of the "Rush Pin", which is still in use to this day. The first woman to be a judge of a U.S. district court was Burnita Shelton Matthews of the Burnell community near Hazlehurst, Mississippi. She was appointed by Harry S. Truman on October 21, 1949.
