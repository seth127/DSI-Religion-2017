   In chemistry, a symbol is a code for a chemical element. It is usually derived from the modern name of the element but for some elements it is derived from the name in Latin.This should not be confused with formula. When a number is present at the bottom right corner of the symbol of the element, only then is it said to be a formula, but if the number is not present, it is a symbol. For example, "He" is the symbol for helium (English name, not known in ancient Roman times), "Pb" for lead (plumbum in Latin), "Hg" for mercury (hydrargyrum in Greek), "W" for tungsten (wolfram in German, not known in Roman times). Only the first letter is capitalized. Temporary symbols assigned to newly or not-yet synthesized elements use 3-letter symbols based on their atomic numbers. For example, "Uno" was the temporary symbol for hassium which had the temporary name of unniloctium and "Uuo" is the symbol for ununoctium (temporary name) with the atomic mass 118. Chemical symbols may be modified by the use of prepended superscripts or subscripts to specify a particular isotope of an atom. Additionally, appended superscripts may be used to indicate the ionization or oxidation state of an element. They are widely used in chemistry and they have been officially chosen by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used.  Attached subscripts or superscripts specifying a nucleotide or molecule have the following meanings and positions: In Chinese, each chemical element has a dedicated character, usually created for the purpose (see Chemical elements in East Asian languages). However, Latin symbols are also used, especially in formulas.  A list of current, dated, as well as proposed and historical signs and symbols is included here with its signification. Also given is each element's atomic number, atomic weight or the atomic mass of the most stable isotope, group and period numbers on the periodic table, and etymology of the symbol. Antimatter atoms are denoted by a bar above the symbol for their matter counterpart, so e.g. H is the symbol for antihydrogen. The following is a list of symbols formerly used or suggested for elements, including symbols for placeholder names and names given by discredited claimants for discovery. The following is a list of pictographic symbols employed to symbolize elements known since ancient times (for example to the alchemists).  Not included in this list are symbolic representations of substances previously called elements (such as certain rare earth mineral blends and the classical elements fire and water of ancient philosophy) which are known today to be multi-atomic.  Also not included are symbolic representations currently used for elements in other languages such as the Chinese characters for elements.  Modern alphabetic notation was introduced in 1814 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius. The following is a list of isotopes of elements given in the previous tables which have been designated unique symbols.  By this it is meant that a comprehensive list of current systematic symbols (in the uAtom form) are not included in the list and can instead be found in the Isotope index chart. The symbols for the named isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium (D) and tritium (T) are still in use today. Heavy water and other deuterated solvents are commonly used in chemistry, and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases. The practice also continues with tritium compounds. When the name of the solvent is given, a lowercase d is sometimes used. For example, d6-benzene and C6D6 can be used instead of [2H6]C6H6. The symbols for isotopes of elements other than hydrogen are no longer in use within the scientific community. Many of these symbols were designated during the early years of radiochemistry, and several isotopes (namely those in the actinium decay family, the radium decay family, and the thorium decay family) bear placeholder names using the early naming system devised by Ernest Rutherford.
