   Physical science &ndash; branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to life science, for example biology. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together called the "physical sciences".  However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena and other branches of chemistry such as organic chemistry. Physical science can be described as all of the following: History of physical science – history of the branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to the biological sciences. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together called the "physical sciences". However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena (organic chemistry, for example). Physics &ndash; branch of science that studies matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.   Physics is one of the "fundamental sciences" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology  etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include: Astronomy &ndash; science of celestial bodies and their interactions in space. Its studies includes the following: (Note: Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, which assumes that people's destiny and human affairs in general correlate to the apparent positions of astronomical objects in the sky - although the two fields share a common origin, they are quite different; astronomers embrace the scientific method, while astrologers do not.) Chemistry &ndash; branch of science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry is chiefly concerned with atoms and molecules and their interactions and transformations, for example, the properties of the chemical bonds formed between atoms to create chemical compounds. As such, chemistry studies the involvement of electrons and various forms of energy in photochemical reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, changes in phases of matter, and separation of mixtures. Preparation and properties of complex substances, such as alloys, polymers, biological molecules, and pharmaceutical agents are considered in specialized fields of chemistry. Earth science &ndash; the science of the planet Earth,  the only identified life-bearing planet. Its studies include the following:   A branch of science  systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe."...&nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&nbsp;—p.vii, J. L. Heilbron, (2003, editor-in-chief). The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science. New York: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-511229-6. A branch of natural science &ndash; natural science is a major branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: life science, or example biology and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences. Physics &ndash; natural and physical science that involves the study of matterAt the start of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Richard Feynman offers the atomic hypothesis as the single most prolific scientific concept: "If, in some cataclysm, all [] scientific knowledge were to be destroyed [save] one sentence&nbsp;[...] what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is&nbsp;[...] that all things are made up of atoms&nbsp;– little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another&nbsp;..."  and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force."Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular succession of events."  More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves."Physics is the study of your world and the world and universe around you."  Branches of physics Astronomy &ndash; study of celestial objects (such as stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae), the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth, including supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Branches of astronomy Chemistry &ndash; studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter.Chemistry. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.
