   Laura Pausini,  (; born 16 May 1974) is an Italian pop singer-songwriter and record producer. As a child, she was encouraged by her father to join him during his performances in local piano bars. After competing in local singing contests, Pausini signed her first recording contract. She rose to fame in 1993, winning the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival with her debut single "La solitudine", which became an Italian standard and an international hit, topping the charts in Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. Her eponymous debut album was released in Italy on 23 April 1993 and later became an international success, selling two million copies worldwide. Its follow-up, Laura, was released in 1994 and confirmed her international success, selling three million copies worldwide. During the same year, she released her first Spanish-language album, Laura Pausini, composed of ten adapted songs originally included in her previous works. The album was certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain, making her the first non-Spanish artist to sell more than one million copies in Spain. As of 2014, she has released ten studio albums, two international greatest hits albums and two compilation albums for the Hispanic and Anglophone market only, respectively. She mostly performs in Italian and Spanish, but she has also recorded songs in English, French, Portuguese and more recent, Catalan. Her only English-language album, From the Inside, was released in 2002, but failed to satisfy commercial expectations both in North America and in the rest of the world. In 2006, her record Io canto was the best-selling album of the year in Italy. In 2004, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini's sales "an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative English–language market". Fimi certified Pausini's sales of more than 70 million records with a Fimi Icon Award. During her career, she has won numerous music awards in Italy and internationally. She has earned the first and third place at the Sanremo Music Festival, two "Lunezia Awards", ten Wind Music Awards, four awards at the Festivalbar, seven Telegatti and an MTV Italian Music Award. Internationally, she has won four awards at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival, three Lo Nuestro Awards, three Latin Grammy Awards, a Billboard Latin Music Award and six World Music Awards. In 2006 she also became the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award, receiving the accolade for Best Latin Pop Album for the record Escucha. She has been honoured as a Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and as a World Ambassador of Emilia Romagna. The elder of two daughters, Laura Pausini was born in Faenza, in the Province of Ravenna, Italy, to Fabrizio Pausini and Gianna Ballardini. She grew up in Solarolo, a small comune in the same region.[A] Her father is a former pianist who also played as a sessionman for ABBA's Frida Lyngstad and entered a band whose members later founded the Italian pop group Pooh. After becoming a piano bar artist, he encouraged Pausini to start performing as a singer. Her first live performance was on 16 May 1985, when she sang together with her father in a restaurant in Bologna. Since then, her father started giving her singing lessons and she continued to perform alongside him in local piano bars. In the meanwhile, she also started singing in a church choir. In 1987 she recorded her first demo album, produced by her father and released to promote her live shows. Titled I sogni di Laura, it consisted of eight covers and five new songs. In 1991 she participated in the Castrocaro Music Festival singing Liza Minnelli's "New York, New York", but she failed to reach the final stage of the competition. During the same year, she took part in another singing competition, Sanremo Famosi, which should have served as a selection for the newcomers' of the following Sanremo Music Festival. Despite being declared joint winner with another contestant, Pausini was not allowed to compete in the Sanremo Music Festival 1992. Thanks to her performances in local singing competitions, Pausini was noted by Italian producer and songwriter Angelo Valsiglio, who introduced her the manager Marco Marati. Valsiglio proposed her "La solitudine", a song he wrote with Pietro Cremonesi and Federico Cavalli. Pausini's rendition convinced Valsiglio and Marati, who wanted Pausini to audition for some major labels. During one of the auditions, she met Fabrizio Giannini of Warner Music Italy's Compagnia Generale del Disco. After impressing him with a performance of an unreleased Mia Martini song, Pausini obtained her first recording contract, becoming one of the first artists being discovered by Giannini, who later launched the careers of several Italian acts, including Irene Grandi.  "La solitudine" was selected as one of the entries of the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival. Pausini performed it for the first time on 23 February 1993, during the first semifinal of the contest. After being admitted to the final, held on 27 February 1993, she won the competition, receiving 7,464 votes by the juries and beating Gerardina Trovato with "Ma non ho più la mia città", who took second place with 7,209 votes. The song also became a commercial success in Italy, peaking at number one on the Italian Musica e dischi singles chart in March 1993 and maintaining the top spot for three consecutive weeks, and it is still one of Pausini's best-known hits. Following the success obtained with her debut single, Pausini started working on her first professional album, Laura Pausini. The album was recorded while Pausini was still a high school student at the "Gaetano Ballardini" Institute of Ceramics in Faenza, Italy, where she got her diploma a few months after the release of her debut studio set. Released by CGD Records in May 1993, it reached the sixth position on the Italian Musica e dischi albums chart, selling 400,000 copies in Italy. The album was also promoted through an Italian outdoor tour during the summer of 1993. In September 1993, Pausini received a Telegatto for Revelation of the Year. In late 1993, the album was released in the rest of Europe, peaking at number three on the Dutch Albums Chart and reaching the top spot in Belgium. It also achieved commercial success in South America, being certified gold in Brazil and Argentina. Worldwide sales of Pausini's debut studio album exceed two million units. Moreover, "La solitudine" became a radio hit in Belgium and the Netherlands, it peaked at number five on the French Singles Chart and it reached the top spot of the Dutch Top 40 and of the Flemish Ultratop 50. The album also spawned the singles "Non c'è" and "Perché non torna più". In February 1994, Pausini participated for the second time in the Sanremo Music Festival, competing in the "Big Artists" section with her entry "Strani amori". The song ranked third in the competition, behind Aleandro Baldi's "Passerà" and Giorgio Faletti's "Signor tenente", and became a hit in Italy, in the Netherlands and in Flanders. The single launched Pausini's second studio album, Laura, released in February 1994. According to CGD Records, the album sold 150,000 copies in Italy in its first week, with initial shipments of 200,000 units. It also peaked at number one on the Dutch Albums Chart and entered the charts in Belgium and Switzerland, selling three million copies worldwide and achieving gold and platinum status in Brazil and Argentina, respectively. Other singles from the album were "Gente", "Lui non sta con te" and "Lettera". During the summer of 1994, Pausini took part in the Italian itinerant TV show Festivalbar, reaching the final stage of the music competition and receiving the Premio Europa for her international success. In 1994 she was also awarded with her second Telegatto, receiving the prize for Best Female Artist. In the meanwhile, she started an Italian tour to promote her album. During the same year, Pausini released her first Spanish-language album, Laura Pausini, a compilation of ten adapted versions of hits from her previous albums, issued by Dro Records. The record became the best-selling album of 1994 in Spain, where it was later certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain for sales exceeding one million units. Pausini was the first non-Spanish artist to achieve this result. Following the commercial success obtained in the country, the Spanish Institute of Italian Culture awarded her a "Globo de Platino" for contributing in the spread of Italian culture in Spain. The album was successful in Latin America too, being certified platinum by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers, the Asociación Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas and the Chilean division of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Moreover, the first four singles from the album, "La soledad", "Se fue", "Amores extraños" and "Gente", entered the top 30 on the Hot Latin Songs chart compiled by Billboard. Thanks to these results, Billboard ranked Pausini the second female revelation of 1994, after Mariah Carey. In 1995 Pausini also received the World Music Award for Best Selling Italian Recording Artist and the Lo Nuestro Award for Best New Artist of the Year. Pausini's first record for the British market was a self-titled compilation album released in 1995, including nine Italian-language hits and an English-language version of her first single, "La solitudine (Loneliness)",] whose lyrics were adapted by Tim Rice. "La solitudine (Loneliness)" was initially set to be released as a single in the United Kingdom on 19 June 1995, but it was postponed and released in September of the same year. Both the album and the single obtained a very poor commercial reception, failing to enter the charts in the United Kingdom. Following the success obtained by Pausini's debut Spanish album, her third studio set was released on 12 September 1996 both in Italian and Spanish, under the titles Le cose che vivi and Las cosas que vives, respectively. Starting from that moment, Pausini has recorded most of her songs both in her native language and in Spanish, in a practice that, according to Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier, has "come to define her career and compound her success". A special edition of the album was also released in Brazil, featuring three additional bonus tracks in Portuguese. The album was preceded by the single "Incancellabile", released to Italian radio stations on 26 August 1996 and titled "Inolvidable" in its version for the Hispanic market. Other singles from the album include the title-track "Le cose che vivi", whose Spanish-language version topped the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart, "Ascolta il tuo cuore", "Seamisai" and "Dos enamorados", which was not released in its Italian-language version. The album sold 3,500,000 copies worldwide and was certified Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, for European sales exceeding 1,000,000 units. At the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards for Latin Music, Pausini was nominated for Pop Female Singer and Video of the Year for the Spanish-language version of "Le cose che vivi". In December 1996, Pausini was among the artists singing for Pope John Paul II during the Natale in Vaticano concert, a Christmas show held at the Paul VI Audience Hall. During the event, she performed a cover of John Lennon's "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" and the song "Il mondo che vorrei". In February 1997 she was also invited as a guest to the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile. On 1 March 1997, she launched from Geneva the World Wide Tour in support of the album, giving concerts in Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, France, as well as in the United States, Canada and many American countries, including Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Mexico. It was Pausini's first international tour, during which she gave concerts in indoor arenas for the first time. In August of the same year, during the last night of the Festivalbar, she received the International Award for the success she achieved abroad. In 1998, Pausini released her fourth studio album, La mia risposta, together with its Spanish-language counterpart, Mi respuesta. The album, which included a song penned by Phil Collins, was dubbed by Italian music critics as a mature work, with influences from soul music, but, despite reaching the top spot of the Italian Albums Chart, it was a moderate commercial success, selling two million copies worldwide. The lead single from the album, "Un'emergenza d'amore", was released in September 1998, and was followed by "In assenza di te" and "La mia risposta", the latter being performed during the Festivalbar in 1999. To promote the album, Pausini began in early 1999 the La Mia Risposta World Tour '99, during which she performed in theatres throughout Europe. On 1 June 1999, she was one of the artists performing along with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in Modena during his annual "Pavarotti and Friends" concert. Pavarotti and Pausini duetted in the Italian version of the aria "Dein ist mein ganzes Herz", titled "Tu che m'hai preso il cuor", from Franz Lehár's operetta Das Land des Lächelns. The live performance was later included in the album Pavarotti & Friends for the Children of Guatemala and Kosovo. In 1999 she also contributed the Richard Marx composition "One More Time" to the Message in a Bottle soundtrack. The track was produced by David Foster who was featured on piano. In 2000, she recorded the song "The Extra Mile" for the soundtrack of the movie Pokémon 2000: The Power of One. The song was included in the album Tra te e il mare, released on 11 September 2000 and preceded by the homonymous single, written by Italian pop singer Biagio Antonacci. Other singles from the album include "Il mio sbaglio più grande", which was a top 20 hit in Italy, and "Volevo dirti che ti amo", whose Spanish-language version "Quiero decirte que te amo" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. The album also features the songs "Viaggio con te", which was composed for his father and which was awarded in 2001 with an Italian Lunezia Award for Best Songwriter of the Year, and "Per vivere", written from the point of view of a homeless child Pausini met in Rio de Janeiro and dedicated to two Brazilian children sponsored by her. Tra te e il mare received a nomination for Album of the Year at the Premio Italiano della Musica, while Pausini was nominated for Best Female Artist during the same award ceremony, as well as in the first edition of the Italian Music Awards, held in February 2001. A Spanish-language version of the album, titled Entre tú y mil mares, was released shortly before the Italian-language edition, on 11 September 2000. At the 2001 Latin Grammy Awards, the record received two nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Album and Best Engineered Album, while Pausini and Alfredo Cerruti were in the shortlist for Producer of the Year. Pausini's first international greatest hits album was released in 2001, both in an Italian-language version and in a Spanish-language edition, titled The Best of Laura Pausini: E ritorno da te and Lo mejor de Laura Pausini: Volveré junto a ti, respectively. The first single, "E ritorno da te"—"Volveré junto a ti" in Spanish—was accompanied by a music video shot by Italian film director Gabriele Muccino. The album also includes the single "Una storia che vale" and features guest appearances by Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil in "Seamisai" and by Italian singer Nek, who plays bass in "Non c'è". Supported by the 2001/2002 World Tour, which started in Miami on 19 October 2001, the greatest hits became one of Pausini's biggest commercial successes, selling 700,000 copies in Italy and 800,000 copies in France. During the concert she gave in Milan on 2 December 2001 as part of the tour, Pausini also recorded her first live video album, titled Live 2001-2002 World Tour and released on 30 November 2002. In 2001, Pausini started working with producers such as Patrick Leonard and John Shanks on her first English-language album, From the Inside. Released in Canada, Mexico and the United States by Atlantic Records on 5 November 2002, the album did not get the expected success, selling 50,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen-Soundscan. The album singles "Surrender" and "If That's Love" reached the top spot on the Hot Dance Club Songs Chart, but Pausini, disappointed at her English-language debut being ignored in the U.S. outside the club scene, abandoned the promotion for From the Inside. The album was later released in Europe too, selling 800,000 copies worldwide. In 2003 Luciano Pavarotti invited her for the second time to the "Pavarotti and Friends" concert, where they duetted again in "Tu che m'hai preso il cuor".   In October 2004 Pausini released her eight studio album, Resta in ascolto, and its Spanish-language counterpart, Escucha. Influenced by international artists including Phil Collins and Celine Dion, the recording is on the subject of a break-up and was written in 2002, during her separation from her ex-boyfriend and producer Alfredo Cerruti. The album features the song "Mi abbandono a te", co-written by Pausini, Rick Nowels and Madonna. It also includes the Biagio Antonacci-written ballad "Vivimi", whose Spanish-language version, "Viveme", won a Billboard Latin Music Award in 2006 for Female Latin Pop Airplay Song of the Year, and the single "Benedetta passione", penned by Italian rock-star Vasco Rossi. Well received by music critics, the album is mainly focused on themes of anger, bitterness, desire for independence and interior peace, but also features a song about the Iraq War, in which Pausini sings about Ali Ismail Abbas, a boy who was severely injured in a nighttime rocket attack near Baghdad in 2003. The album debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and sold 350,000 copies in Italy. Its Spanish version later won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 and Best Latin Pop Album at the 48th Grammy Awards, making Pausini the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award. In January 2005, Pausini started a new tour to promote the album. The concerts she gave at the Zénith de Paris on 22 and 23 March 2005 were filmed and released as a live album in November 2005, titled Live in Paris 05. Pausini made a guest appearance on Michael Bublé's 2005 live album Caught in the Act, singing a duet with Bublé of Lou Rawls' hit "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine". The duet was placed on both the audio CD, and the full concert DVD that aired on PBS as an episode of Great Performances. At the 2006 Lo Nuestro Award, Pausini was nominated in the sections Album of the Year for Escucha, Song of the Year and Video of the Year for "Viveme" and won the award for Best Female Pop Artist.  In November 2006, Pausini released the album Io canto / Yo canto, consisting of covers of Italian pop rock songs. On the album liner notes, Pausini wrote: "here is the music I listen to when I'm at my saddest, or when I feel a moment is special, the songs I used to sing as a young girl when I first started performing, and above all those which taught me to love music, and how music can move you so deeply, regardless of its genre or style". The album also features duets with Tiziano Ferro, Juanes and Johnny Hallyday. It debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and held the top spot for 8 non-consecutive weeks. It also became the best-selling album of 2006 in Italy, selling 500,000 copies in less than two months. On 8 November 2007, the album won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards. Laura dedicated the award to the memory of Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Later on during the show she sang "Vivere (Dare to Live)" alongside Italian singer Andrea Bocelli.

Pausini grew up listening to Aznavour's songs, and in a January 2009 interview on France 2's Vivement Dimanche hosted by Michel Drucker, Aznavour said of Pausini that "she knows the lyrics [to my songs] better than me." In November 2009 the album won Best Female Album at the Latin Grammy Awards. In 2010 Pausini also won the Lo Nuestro Award for Female Artist of the Year.  On 21 June 2009, Pausini organized a mega-concert in the San Siro Stadium in Milan, raising money to support the victims of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake.

Due to her voice, Pausini has been compared by music critics to various female artists, including Milva, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand. At the beginning of her career, she was considered by music critics as a teen idol mainly singing about adolescent love affairs and problems. She was also strongly criticized for her songs, described as too melancholic and trivial. Starting from her 1998's La mia risposta / Mi respuesta, Italian music critics considered her as a more mature singer and later praised her simplicity and her voice, describing Pausini as an interpreter of her years. Although Pausini is mainly a melodic pop singer, her musical style evolved during her career, with influences from various genres, including Latin music, soul music and rock music. In 2001, David Cazares of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel described Pausini's music as "an assortment of glossy and sentimental pop ballads backed by light rock instrumentation and synthesized strings". In 2006, The Washington Post's Achy Obejas wrote that Pausini is distinguished from other Latin pop singer by her sophistication and her European sensibilities. According to Musica e dischi's Antonio Orlando, the key elements in Pausini's style are romanticism, optimism, melancholy and surrounding melodies. Starting from her 1996's album Le cose che vivi / Las cosas que vives, Pausini has also co-written most of her songs and starting from her 1998's La mia risposta / Mi respuesta she has been involved in the production of her albums. Pausini left her hometown in 1995, when she moved to Milan with her partner, manager and producer Alfredo Cerruti Jr. Their relationship ended in 2002. Between 2002 and 2005 Pausini was romantically involved with her new manager, Gabriele Parisi. She is currently engaged with the Italian guitarist, composer, music producer and former singer Paolo Carta. On 15 September 2012, Pausini confirmed through her official Facebook page that she was expecting her first daughter with her partner Paolo Carta. Their daughter, Paola, was born on 8 February 2013. Pausini describes herself as a Roman Catholic woman, but expressed doubts about Roman Church's position on various themes, including contraception, abortion and premarital sex. In September 2000 she explained her position during an interview to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica:  – Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic: Awarded the third highest civil honour in Italy, by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on 6 February 2006.     |- style="background:#ddd;" | colspan="5" style="text-align:center;"| Grammy    |- style="background:#ddd;" | colspan="5" style="text-align:center;"| Latin Grammy       ^ Sources indicate different locations for Pausini's birth—The Comunes of Faenza and Solarolo, Ravenna, Italy.
