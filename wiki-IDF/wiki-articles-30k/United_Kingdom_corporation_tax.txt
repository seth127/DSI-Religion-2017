Corporation tax is a corporate tax levied in the United Kingdom on the profits made by companies and on the profits of permanent establishments of non-UK resident companies and associations that trade in the European Union.  Prior to the tax's enactment on 1 April 1965, companies and individuals paid the same income tax, with an additional profits tax levied on companies.  The Finance Act 1965 replaced this structure for companies and associations with a single corporate tax, which borrowed its basic structure and rules from the income tax system. Since 1997, the UK's Tax Law Rewrite ProjectTax Law Rewrite, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Retrieved 17 April 2007 has been modernising the UK's tax legislation, starting with income tax, while the legislation imposing corporation tax has itself been amended; the rules governing income tax and corporation tax have thus diverged. Corporation tax is governed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (as amended).Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (c. 1), Office of Public Sector Information, responsible for the operation of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), ISBN 0-10-540188-9Most income tax rules have been rewritten in the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, and Income Tax Act 2007. Originally introduced as a classical tax system, in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and companies' shareholders were also liable to income tax on the dividends that they received, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to an imputation system in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend.  The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of advance corporation tax and of repayable dividend tax credits.  Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three.  Tax competition between jurisdictions reduced the main rate from 28% in 2008-2010, down to a flat rate of 20% as of April 2015. The UK government faced problems with its corporate tax structure, including European Court of Justice judgements that aspects of it are incompatible with EU treaties. Tax avoidance schemes marketed by the financial sector have also proven an irritant, and been countered by complicated anti-avoidance legislation. The complexity of the corporation tax system is a recognised issue.  The Labour government, supported by the Opposition parties, carried through wide-scale reform from the Tax Law Rewrite project, resulting in the Corporation Tax Act 2010. The tax has slowly been integrating generally accepted accounting practice, with the corporation tax system in various specific areas based directly on the accounting treatment. Total net Corporation Tax receipts in 2014-15 were £43.0 billion, which is an increase of 7 per cent from £40.3 billion in 2013-14.  Before 1965, companies were subject to income tax on their profits,Corporate Tax (PDF), HMRC. Retrieved 9 April 2007 at the same rate as was levied on individuals. An imputation system existed, whereby the income tax paid by a company was offset against the income tax liability of a shareholder who received dividends from the company. With the standard rate of income tax in 1949 at 50%, a company making £1,000 in profits would pay £500 in tax. If the company then chose to pay a £100 dividend, the recipient would be treated as if he had earned £200 and had paid £100 in income tax on it – the tax paid by the company fully covered the tax due from the individual on the dividend paid. If, however, the individual was subject to tax at a higher rate (known as "surtax"), he (not the company) would be liable to pay the additional tax. In addition to income tax, companies were also subject to a profits tax, introduced by Labour Chancellor Sir Stafford Cripps, which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on dividends (profits distributed to shareholders) than on profits retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would retain profits for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax did not have the desired effect, so the distributed profits tax was increased by 20%"50 years ago", Newark Advertiser. Retrieved 8 March 2015 by the post-war Labour government, in an attempt to coerce companies into retaining more of their profits. At the time of Hugh Gaitskell's 1951 budget, the profits tax was 50% for distributed profits and 10% for undistributed profits. A series of reductions in the profits tax were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed profits and 2.5% on undistributed profits by 1957, but the profits tax was no longer income tax-deductible. Derick Heathcoat-Amory's Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential profits tax with a single profits tax measure, applicable to both retained and distributed profits. This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain profits for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce. Under the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan, the Finance Act 1965 replaced the system of income tax and profits tax from 1 April 1965 with a single measure, the Corporation Tax, which re-introduced aspects of the old system. Corporation Tax was charged at a uniform rate on all profits, but additional tax was then payable if profits were distributed as a dividend to shareholders. In effect, dividends suffered double taxation. This method of corporation tax is known as the classical system and is similar to that used in the United States. The effect of the tax was to revert to the distribution tax in operation from 1949 to 1959: dividend payments were subject to higher tax than profits retained within the company. The Finance Act 1965 also introduced capital gains tax, at a rate of 30%. This was a tax charged on the gains arising on the disposal of capital assets by individuals. While companies were exempted from capital gains tax, they were liable to corporation tax on their "chargeable gains", which were calculated in the same way as individuals' capital gains. The tax applied to company shares as well as other assets. Before 1965, capital gains were not taxed, and it was advantageous for taxpayers to argue that a receipt was non-taxable "capital" rather than taxable "revenue". The basic structure of the tax, where company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income, remained unchanged until 1973, when a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments. Unlike the previous imputation system, the tax credit to the shareholder was less than the corporation tax paid (corporation tax was higher than the standard rate of income tax, but the imputation, or set-off, was only of standard rate tax). When companies made distributions, they also paid advance corporation tax (known as ACT), which could be set off against the main corporation tax charge, subject to certain limits (the full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed).Company Taxation Manual CTM20105 — ACT: set-off against CT on profits: introduction, HMRC.

Retrieved 12 April 2007 Individuals could set off the tax credit against their income tax liability.Company Taxation Manual CTM15150 — Distributions: general: tax consequences, HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007 On introduction, ACT was set at 30% of the gross dividend (the actual amount paid plus the tax credit). If a company made a £70 dividend payment to an individual, the company would pay £30 of advance corporation tax. The shareholder would receive the £70 cash payment, plus a tax credit of £30; thus, the individual would be deemed to have earned £100, and to have already paid tax of £30 on it. The ACT paid by the company would be deductible against its final "mainstream" corporation tax bill. To the extent that the individual's tax on the dividend was less than the tax credit – for example, if his income was too low to pay tax (below £595 in 1973–1974Income Tax Personal Allowances and Reliefs 1973–74 to 1989–90 (PDF), HMRC. Retrieved 9 April 2007) – he would be able to reclaim some or all of the £30 tax paid by the company. The set-off was only partial, since the company would pay 52% tax (small companies had lower rates, but still higher than the ACT rate), and thus the £70 received by the individual actually represented pre-tax profits of £145.83. Accordingly, only part of the double taxation was relieved. ACT was not payable on dividends from one UK company to another (unless the payor company elected to pay it).Company Taxation Manual CTM20070 — ACT: general: qualifying and non-qualifying distributions, HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007 Also, the recipient company was not taxed on that dividend receipt, except for dealers in shares and life assurance companies in respect of some of their profits. As the payor company would have suffered tax on the payments it made, the company that received the dividend also received a credit that it could use to reduce the amount of ACT it itself paid, or, in certain cases, apply to have the tax credit repaid to them.  The level of ACT was linked to the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993. The March 1993 Budget of Norman Lamont cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22.5% from April 1993, and 20% from April 1994. These changes were accompanied with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20%, while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25%. Persons liable for tax were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change. The change had bigger effects on pensions and non-taxpayers. A pension fund receiving a £1.2&nbsp;m dividend income prior to the change would have been able to reclaim £400,000 in tax, giving a total income of £1.6&nbsp;m. After the change, only £300,000 was reclaimable, reducing income to £1.5&nbsp;m, a fall of 6.25%. Gordon Brown's summer Budget of 1997Budget 1997, HM Treasury. Retrieved 25 April 2007 ended the ability of pension funds and other tax-exempt companies to reclaim tax credits with immediate effect, and for individuals from April 1999.

Despite this, critics such as Member of Parliament Frank Field described it as a "hammer blow" and the Sunday Times described it as a swindle, with the hypothetical £1.5&nbsp;m income described above falling to £1.2&nbsp;m, a fall in income of 20%, because no tax would be reclaimable. From 6 April 1999 ACT was abolished, and the tax credit on dividends was reduced to 10%. There was a matching reduction in the basic income tax rate on dividends to 10%, while a new higher-rate of 32.5% was introduced which led to an overall effective 25% tax rate for higher rate taxpayers on dividends (after setting this "notional" tax credit against the tax liability).

The Budgets of 1983–1988 saw sharp cuts in both main and small companies' rates, falling to 35% and 25% respectively. Budgets between 1988 and 2001 brought further falls to a 30% main rate and 19% small companies' rates.

For companies with profits under £50,000 the corporation tax rate varied between 0% and 19%.

There is a risk of double taxation whenever a company receives income that has already been taxed. This could be dividend income, which will have been paid out of the post-tax profits of another company and which may have suffered withholding tax. Or it could be because the company itself has suffered foreign tax, perhaps because it conducts part of its trade through an overseas permanent establishment, or because it receives other types of foreign income. Double taxation is avoided for UK dividends by exempting them from tax for most companies: only dealers in shares suffer tax on them.Company Taxation Manual CTM02060 — Corporation Tax: computation of income: dividends and other distributions received, HMRC.

Credit relief is given as a deduction from the UK tax liability, but is restricted to the amount of UK tax suffered on the foreign income. There is a system of onshore pooling, so that overseas tax suffered in high tax territories may be set off against taxable income arising from low tax territories. From 1 July 2009, new rules were introduced to exempt most non-UK dividends from corporation tax so these double taxation rules in respect of non-UK dividends will be of less common application in practice after that date.

Retrieved 16 April 2007 A detailed explanation of these can be found in: United Kingdom corporation tax loss relief. The UK does not permit tax consolidation, where companies in a group are treated as though they are a single entity for tax purposes. One of the main benefits of tax consolidation is that tax losses in one entity in a group are automatically relievable against the tax profits of another. Instead, the UK permits a form of loss relief called "group relief".Company Taxation Manual CTM80105 — Groups: group relief: outline, HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007 Where a company has losses arising in an accounting period (other than capital losses, or losses arising under Case V or VI of Schedule D) in excess of its other taxable profits for the period, it may surrender these losses to a group member with sufficient taxable profits in the same accounting period.Company Taxation Manual CTM80110 — Groups: group relief: reliefs which may be claimed, HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007 The company receiving the losses may offset them against their own taxable profits. Exceptions include that a company in the oil and gas extraction industry may not accept group relief against the profits arising on its oil and gas extraction business, and a life assurance company may only accept group relief against its profits chargeable to tax at the standard shareholder rate applicable to that company. Separate rules apply for dual resident companies. Full group relief is permitted between companies subject to UK corporation tax that are in the same 75% group, where companies have a common ultimate parent, and at least 75% of the shares in each company (other than the ultimate parent) are owned by other companies in the group. The companies making up a 75% group do not all need to be UK-resident or subject to UK corporation tax relief. An open-ended investment company cannot form part of a group.Company Taxation Manual CTM80155 — Groups: group relief: qualifying tests.

In particular, legislation should not be discriminatory under the EC treaty. A number of cases where UK tax laws are believed to be discriminatory have been brought to the European Court of Justice, usually with respect to freedom of establishment and freedom of movement of capital. Key cases which have been decided include: Also, the case of ICI v ColmerICI v Colmer [1999] BTC 440 led to the UK amending its definition of a group, for group relief purposes. Previously, the definition required that all companies and intermediate parent companies in a group to be UK resident.
