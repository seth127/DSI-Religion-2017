    Kim Antonie Lode Clijsters (; born 8 June 1983) is a Belgian former professional tennis player. Clijsters is a former world No. 1 in both singles and doubles. Clijsters won 41 WTA singles titles and 11 WTA doubles titles. She won four Grand Slam singles titles: three at the US Open, in 2005, 2009, and 2010 and one at the Australian Open in 2011. She was also runner-up in four Grand Slam singles tournaments and won the WTA Tour Championships singles title in 2002, 2003, and 2010. In doubles, she won the French Open and Wimbledon titles in 2003. She was also runner-up in two Grand Slam doubles tournaments, one WTA Championships doubles tournament, and one Grand Slam mixed doubles tournament. In 2001, Clijsters was part of the Belgium Fed Cup winning team. Clijsters announced her retirement with immediate effect on 6 May 2007,Sport.be, Kim's Diary-Thanks you, 6 May 2007  but almost two years later, on 26 March 2009, she publicly declared her intent to return to the WTA tour for the 2009 summer hard court season.Reuters.com, Clijsters announces return to tour, 26 March 2009 In only her third tournament back, she won her second US Open title, becoming the first unseeded player and wildcard to win the tournament, the first unranked player to win a Grand Slam and the first mother to win a major since Evonne Goolagong in 1980.SportsIllustrated.cnn.com In June 2011, TIME magazine named her one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future". According to Forbes in August 2011, she became the fifth highest-paid female athlete over the previous year. On 20 May 2012, Clijsters, who had previously announced that 2012 would be her last season, revealed that she would retire after the US Open. On 29 August 2012, Clijsters played her last singles match of her career at the 2012 US Open where she lost in the second round to Laura Robson. Clijsters has a powerful physique that melds naturally with a strong baseline game. The Belgian is equipped with an array of powerful and deep forehand and backhand shots . Her forehand, although at times erratic, is her main weapon. She is easily able to dictate play with her forehand and she is capable of hitting winners from any position on the court. Clijsters also has a strong and consistent two-handed backhand, which is arguably one of the best in the women's game, particularly her cross-court backhand, which she hits with great accuracy and pace. An accomplished doubles player, Clijsters has an adept net game. She often mixes up her aggressive-style play with drop shots and backhand slices to draw her opponents into the net, where many players are uncomfortable. She also has a very solid over-head and is noted for her quick transition from the baseline to the net to finish points. Clijsters' first serve is not overwhelmingly powerful, but is placed well and earns her free points. When timed correctly, her serve can be considered a major weapon. Clijsters also possesses a strong second serve that is not easily attackable; however, she sometimes lacks confidence on serve and loses timing, resulting in a high number of double faults in some matches. Clijsters is also widely recognised for her all-court defence, characterized by her speed and athleticism, and has the capacity to wear her opponents down. Clijsters is one of few players on the WTA tour who can slide on all surfaces. Clijsters possesses the perfect balance of athleticism: her powerful build and strength from her father Leo, a successful football player in Belgium, and flexibility from her mother Els, a national gymnast. Maria Sharapova, interviewed after losing to Clijsters in the 2005 Nasdaq-100 Open, said, "You just have to expect that she's going to get every ball back". Clijsters was born on 8 June 1983, in Bilzen, Limburg, in the Flemish Region of Belgium. She is the daughter of Lei Clijsters, a former international footballer, and Els Vandecaetsbeek, a former national gymnastics champion. Lei Clijsters died of lung cancer on 4 January 2009."Father of Kim Clijsters Dies" SportsIllustrated.cnn.com, 4 January 2009  Clijsters says that she inherited footballer's legs from her father and a gymnast's flexibility from her mother.Face to face, The Guardian (5 October 2003) Kim's younger sister Elke finished 2002 as the ITF World Junior Doubles champion and retired in 2004 after back injuries.
