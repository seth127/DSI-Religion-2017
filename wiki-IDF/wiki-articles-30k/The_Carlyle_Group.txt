Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.David A. Vise, "Area Merchant Banking Firm Formed," Washington Post, Oct. 5, 1987, F33  The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.  Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration.  Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications.  Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first yearPaul Farhi, "Chi-Chi's Bid Won D.C.

The New York Times, January 30, 1989"Little-Known Carlyle Scores Big". New York Times, March 26, 1991 In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.  The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990.  In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991. Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry.  In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems."GENERAL DYNAMICS SELLS UNIT TO PRIVATE GROUP". New York Times, October 6, 1992  Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994."TRACOR TO BUY GDE SYSTEMS FROM CARLYLE GROUP". New York Times, October 14, 1994  Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993."PHILIPS TO SELL MAGNAVOX ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS". New York Times, July 28, 1993  Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995.  Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman."Hughes Aircraft Sets Purchase Of Magnavox for $370 Million". New York Times, September 12, 1995  Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries.  The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point."Carlyle Beats Out Dynamics for United Defense". Wall Street Journal, August 27, 1997"Military Contractor Sold to Buyout Firm". New York Times, August 27, 1997  Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.United Defense Industries. GlobalSecurity.org, July 31, 2005. Retrieved October 22, 2008. In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments. Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001.  In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.  Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time."Bin Laden Family Is Tied To U.S. Group". Wall Street Journal, September 27, 2001  These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911.  The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic."Bin Laden Family Liquidates Holdings With Carlyle Group". New York Times, October 26, 2001 Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly.  Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5&nbsp;billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75&nbsp;billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30&nbsp;billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway. Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci.  Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[IBM's Gerstner To Join Carlyle As Chairman].  Wall Street Journal, November 22, 2002[Gerstner to Be Carlyle Group Chairman; Former IBM Chief Brings Long List of Contacts to Private Equity Firm]. The Washington Post, November 22, 2002  The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[The Man Behind the Curtain at Carlyle Group --- Despite All the Powerful Names, Little-Known David Rubenstein Drives Its Fund-Raising Success].  Wall Street Journal, August 25, 2003  At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%. Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[VERIZON SELLS HAWAIIAN UNIT FOR $1.6 BILLION].  New York Times, May 22, 2004  Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout.  The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems.  Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.Carlyle's Bet on Telecom in Hawaii Ends Badly.  Wall Street Journal, December 2, 2008  As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital.  In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0&nbsp;billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DANNY HAKIM.

The New York Times, September 13, 2005 The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5&nbsp;billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.MOUAWAD, JAD. "Kinder Morgan Agrees to an Improved Buyout Offer Led by Its Chairman." The New York Times, August 29, 2006. In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the  $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor.  At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008-2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.King of Capital, 231-235Sorkin, Andrew Ross and Flynn, Laurie J. "Blackstone Alliance to Buy Chip Maker for $17.6 Billion."

In March 2009, New York State and federal authorities began an investigation into payments made by Carlyle's Riverstone Holdings subsidiary to placement agents allegedly made in exchange for investments from the New York State Common Retirement System, the state's pension fund.  In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.  It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo."NY Cuomo: Tainted deals included Carlyle Group" Reuters, March 19, 2009  In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.Carlyle Pays $20 Million to Resolve Inquiry.

Wall Street Journal, May 2, 2012 Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures. In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[ ] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets. Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans. In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[ ] On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets." On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition  under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[ ]  for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court appointed liquidator.[ ]  The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint". Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush. In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.Moore, Michael "Factual Back-Up for Fahrenheit 9/11: Section Four" Michaelmoore.com  Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11&nbsp;billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.Pratley, Nils. Fahrenheit 9/11 had no effect, says Carlyle chief, The Guardian, February 15, 2005.  A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.  Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother. In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.
