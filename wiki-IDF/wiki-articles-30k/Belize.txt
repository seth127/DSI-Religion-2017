     Belize () is a country on the eastern coast of Central America. It is the only country in Central America whose official language is English, though Belizean Creole (Kriol) and Spanish are also commonly spoken. Belize is bordered on the north by Mexico, on the south and west by Guatemala, and on the east by the Caribbean Sea. Its mainland is about  long and  wide. With  of land and  a population of 347,369, Belize has the lowest population density in Central America. The country's population growth rate of 1.87% per year (2015) is the second highest in the region and one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Belize's abundance of terrestrial and marine species and its diversity of ecosystems give it a key place in the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Belize has a diverse society, composed of many cultures and languages that reflect its rich history. Originally part of the British Empire, it shares a common colonial history with other Anglophone Caribbean countries. From 1862 to 1973 the area went by the name of British Honduras. It became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1981, retaining Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. Belize is considered a Central American and Caribbean nation with strong ties to both the Latin American and Caribbean regions. It is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Central American Integration System (SICA), the only country to hold full membership in all three regional organisations. Belize is known for its September Celebrations, its extensive coral reefs, and punta music. The origin of the name Belize is unclear, but the earliest record of the name is found in the journal of the Dominican priest Fray José Delgado, dating to 1677. Delgado recorded the names of three major rivers that he crossed while travelling north along the Caribbean coast: Rio Soyte, Rio Xibum, and Rio Balis. These names, which correspond to the Sittee River, Sibun River and Belize River, were provided to Delgado by his translator. It is likely that Delgado's "Balis" was actually the Mayan word belix (or beliz), meaning "muddy-watered". Others have suggested that the name is derived from a Spanish pronunciation of the name of the Scottish buccaneer Peter Wallace, which was applied to an early settlement at the mouth of the Belize River, although there is no proof that Wallace actually settled in the area and some have characterised this claim as a myth. Several other possible etymologies have been suggested by writers and historians, including French and African origins.  The Maya civilization emerged at least three millennia ago in the lowland area of the Yucatán Peninsula and the highlands to the south, in what is now southeastern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and western Honduras. Many aspects of this culture persist in the area despite nearly 500 years of European domination. Prior to about 2500 BC, some hunting and foraging bands settled in small farming villages; they later domesticated crops such as corn, beans, squash, and chili peppers. A profusion of languages and subcultures developed within the Maya core culture. Between about 2500 BC and 250 AD, the basic institutions of Maya civilisation emerged. The peak of this civilisation occurred during the classic period, which began about 250 AD.    The Maya civilization spread across what is now Belize around 1500 BC, and flourished there until about 900 AD. The recorded history of the middle and southern regions is dominated by Caracol, an urban political centre that may have supported over 140,000 people. North of the Maya Mountains, the most important political centre was Lamanai. In the late Classic Era of Maya civilisation (600–1000 AD), as many as 1 million people may have lived in the area that is now Belize. When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, the area that is now Belize included three distinct Maya territories: Chetumal province, which encompassed the area around Corozal Bay; Dzuluinicob province, which encompassed the area between the New River and the Sibun River, west to Tipu; and a southern territory controlled by the Manche Ch'ol Maya, encompassing the area between the Monkey River and the Sarstoon River. Spanish conquistadors explored the land and declared it a Spanish colony but chose not to settle because of its lack of resources like gold and the strong defence of the Yucatán by the Mayans. English and Scottish settlers and pirates known as the Baymen entered the area in the 17th and 18th centuries respectively and established a logwood trade colony, slave economy and port in what became the Belize District. Baymen first settled on the coast of what is now Belize in 1638, seeking a sheltered region from which they could attack Spanish ships (see English settlement in Belize). The settlers turned to cutting logwood during the 18th century, establishing a system of slave labour using black slaves. The wood yielded a fixing agent for clothing dyes that was vital to the European wool industry. The Spanish granted the British settlers the right to occupy the area and cut logwood in exchange for an end to piracy. The British first appointed a superintendent over the Belize area in 1786. Before then the British government had not recognised the settlement as a colony for fear of provoking a Spanish attack. The delay in government oversight allowed the settlers to establish their own laws and forms of government. During this period, a few wealthy settlers gained control of the local legislature, known as the Public Meeting, as well as of most of the settlement's land and timber. The Battle of St. George's Caye was a 1798 military engagement off the coast of Belize between a Spanish invading force from what would become Mexico, attempting to capture the Baymen-controlled territory for Spain from a small force of Baymen and their Black slaves. Spain's last attempt occurred on September 10, 1798, when the Baymen and their black slaves repelled the Spanish fleet in a short engagement with no known casualties on either side. The anniversary of the battle is a national holiday in Belize and is celebrated by some Belizeans to commemorate the "first Belizeans" and the defense of their territory.  In the early 19th century, the British sought greater control over the settlers, threatening to suspend the Public Meeting unless it observed the government's instructions to eliminate slavery outright.  Slavery was abolished in the British Empire in 1833, but this did little to change working conditions for labourers in the Belize settlement. Slaves of the colony were valued for their potentially superior abilities in the work of mahogany extraction. As a result, former slave owners in British Honduras earned £53.69 on average per slave, the highest amount paid in any British territory. Soon after, a series of institutions were put in place to ensure the continued presence of a viable labour force. Some of these greatly restricted the ability of individuals to obtain land, in a debt-peonage system to organise the newly freed.The position of being "extra special" mahogany and logwood cutters undergirded the early ascriptions of the capacities (and consequently the limitations) of people of African descent in the colony. Because a small elite controlled the settlement's land and commerce, former slaves had no choice but to continue to work in timber cutting. In 1836, after the emancipation of Central America from Spanish rule, the British claimed the right to administer the region. In 1862, Great Britain formally declared it a British Crown Colony, subordinate to Jamaica, and named it British Honduras. As a colony, Belize began to attract British investors. Among the British firms that dominated the colony in the late 19th century was the Belize Estate and Produce Company, which eventually acquired half of all the privately held land in the colony. Belize Estate's influence accounts in part for the colony's reliance on the mahogany trade throughout the rest of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.  The Great Depression of the 1930s caused a near-collapse of the colony's economy as British demand for timber plummeted. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a devastating hurricane that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalise labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Economic conditions improved during World War II as many Belizean men entered the armed forces or otherwise contributed to the war effort. Following the war, the colony's economy stagnated because of the pressures caused by the war's spending. Britain's decision to devalue the British Honduras dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. The People's Committee's successor, the People's United Party (PUP), sought constitutional reforms that expanded voting rights to all adults. The first election under universal suffrage was held in 1954 and was decisively won by the PUP, beginning a three-decade period in which the PUP dominated the country's politics. Pro-independence activist George Cadle Price became PUP leader in 1956 and the effective head of government in 1961, a post he would hold under various titles until 1984. Under a new constitution Britain granted British Honduras self-government in 1964. On June 1, 1973 British Honduras was officially renamed Belize.CARICOM – Member Country Profile – BELIZE, Caribbean Community. (accessed June 23, 2015) Progress toward independence, however, was hampered by a Guatemalan claim to sovereignty over Belizean territory. Belize was granted independence on September 21, 1981, and about 1,500 British troops remained in Belize, in order to provide protection from a Guatemalan threat. To forestall any possible incursions the British had previously stationed a detachment of Royal Air Force (RAF) VTOL Hawker Siddeley Harriers in the territory in 1975, and again in 1977, as a deterrent. Guatemala refused to recognise the new nation, because of its longstanding territorial dispute with the British, until 1991. With Price at the helm, the PUP won all national elections until 1984. In that election, the first national election after independence, the PUP was defeated by the United Democratic Party (UDP). UDP leader Manuel Esquivel replaced Price as prime minister, with Price himself unexpectedly losing his own House seat to a UDP challenger. The PUP under Price returned to power after elections in 1989. Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano Elías formally recognised Belize's independence in 1991. The following year the United Kingdom announced that it would end its military involvement in Belize, and the RAF Harrier detachment was withdrawn the same year, having remained stationed in the country continuously since its deployment had become permanent there in 1980. British soldiers were withdrawn in 1994, but the United Kingdom left behind a military training unit to assist with the newly created Belize Defence Force. The UDP regained power in the 1993 national election, and Esquivel became prime minister for a second time. Soon afterwards Esquivel announced the suspension of a pact reached with Guatemala during Price's tenure, claiming Price had made too many concessions to gain Guatemalan recognition. The pact may have curtailed the 130-year-old border dispute between the two countries. Border tensions continued into the early 2000s, although the two countries cooperated in other areas. The PUP won a landslide victory in the 1998 national elections, and PUP leader Said Musa was sworn in as prime minister. In the 2003 elections the PUP maintained its majority, and Musa continued as prime minister. He pledged to improve conditions in the underdeveloped and largely inaccessible southern part of Belize. In 2005, Belize was the site of unrest caused by discontent with the PUP government, including tax increases in the national budget. On February 8, 2008, Dean Barrow was sworn in as prime minister after his UDP won a landslide victory in general elections. Barrow and the UDP were re-elected in 2012 with a considerably smaller majority. Throughout Belize's history, Guatemala has claimed ownership of all or part of Belizean territory. This claim is occasionally reflected in maps showing Belize as Guatemala's twenty-third department. As of June 2015, the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious.Best, Tony (June 8, 2006). . Nationnews.com Guatemala's claim to Belizean territory rests, in part, on Clause VII of the Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859, which obligated the British to build a road between Belize City and Guatemala. At various times the issue has required mediation by the United Kingdom, Caribbean Community heads of government, the Organization of American States (OAS), Mexico, and the United States. Notably, both Guatemala and Belize participate in confidence-building measures approved by the OAS such as the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project.  Belize is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The structure of government is based on the British parliamentary system, and the legal system is modelled on the common law of England. The symbolic head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title Queen of Belize. The Queen resides in the United Kingdom, and is represented in Belize by the Governor-General. Executive authority is exercised by the cabinet, which advises the Governor-General and is led by the Prime Minister of Belize, who is head of government. Cabinet ministers are members of the majority political party in parliament and usually hold elected seats within it concurrent with their cabinet positions. The bicameral National Assembly of Belize is composed of a House of Representatives and a Senate. The 31 members of the House are popularly elected to a maximum five-year term and introduce legislation affecting the development of Belize. The Governor-General appoints the 12 members of the Senate, with a Senate president selected by the members. The Senate is responsible for debating and approving bills passed by the House. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Parliament of Belize. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Members of the independent judiciary are appointed. The judicial system includes local magistrates grouped under the Magistrates' Court, which hears less serious cases. The Supreme Court (Chief Justice) hears murder and similarly serious cases, and the Court of Appeal, hears appeals from convicted individuals seeking to have their sentences overturned. Defendants may, under certain circumstances, appeal their cases to the Caribbean Court of Justice. Since 1974 the party system in Belize has been dominated by the centre-left People's United Party and the centre-right United Democratic Party, although there have been other small parties that have participated at all levels of elections in the past. Though none of these small political parties have ever won any significant number of seats and/or offices, their challenge has been growing over the years.  Belize is a full participating member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, Organization of American States (OAS), Central American Integration System (SICA), Caribbean Community (CARICOM), CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), Association of Caribbean States (ACS),. BarbadosBusiness.gov.bb and the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), which currently pertains only to Barbados, Belize and Guyana. In 2001 the Caribbean Community heads of government voted on a measure declaring that the region should work towards replacing the UK's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with the Caribbean Court of Justice. It is still in the process of acceding to CARICOM and SICA treaties, including trade and single market treaties. Belize is an original member (1995) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and participates actively in its work. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the Group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific states (ACP). CARIFORUM presently the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the European Union.   The Belize Defence Force (BDF) serves as the country's military and is responsible for protecting the sovereignty of Belize. The BDF, with the Belize National Coast Guard and the Immigration Department, is a department of the Ministry of Defence and Immigration. In 1997 the regular army numbered over 900, the reserve army 381, the air wing 45 and the maritime wing 36, amounting to an overall strength of approximately 1400. In 2005, the maritime wing became part of the Belizean Coast Guard."Channel 5 Belize" (November 28, 2005),  In 2012, the Belizean government spent about $17 million on the military, constituting 1.08% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). After Belize achieved independence in 1981 the United Kingdom maintained a deterrent force (British Forces Belize) in the country to protect it from invasion by Guatemala (see Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory). During the 1980s this included a battalion and No. 1417 Flight RAF of Harriers. The main British force left in 1994, three years after Guatemala recognised Belizean independence, but the United Kingdom maintained a training presence via the British Army Training and Support Unit Belize (BATSUB) and 25 Flight AAC until 2011 when the last British Forces left Ladyville Barracks, with the exception of seconded advisers.  Belize is divided into six districts, shown below with their capital cities and populations at the 2010 Census:Central Statistical Office, Belize. These districts are further divided into 31 constituencies. Local government in Belize comprises four types of local authorities: city councils, town councils, village councils and community councils. The two city councils (Belize City and Belmopan) and seven town councils cover the urban population of the country, while village and community councils cover the rural population..

Temperatures vary according to elevation, proximity to the coast, and the moderating effects of the northeast trade winds off the Caribbean. Average temperatures in the coastal regions range from {{convert|24|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} in January to {{convert|27|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} in July. Temperatures are slightly higher inland, except for the southern highland plateaus, such as the [[Mountain Pine Ridge]], where it is noticeably cooler year round. Overall, the seasons are marked more by differences in humidity and rainfall than in temperature.  Average rainfall varies considerably, from {{convert|1350|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the north and west to over {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the extreme south. Seasonal differences in rainfall are greatest in the northern and central regions of the country where, between January and April or May, less than {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall per month. The dry season is shorter in the south, normally only lasting from February to April. A shorter, less rainy period, known locally as the "little dry", usually occurs in late July or August, after the initial onset of the rainy season.  [[Hurricane]]<nowiki/>s have played key—and devastating—roles in [[History of Belize|Belizean history]]. In 1931 an unnamed hurricane destroyed over two-thirds of the buildings in Belize City and killed more than 1,000 people. In 1955 [[Hurricane Janet]] levelled the northern town of [[Corozal Town|Corozal]]. Only six years later, [[Hurricane Hattie]] struck the central coastal area of the country, with winds in excess of {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4|m|ft|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[storm tide]]<nowiki/>s. The devastation of Belize City for the second time in thirty years prompted the relocation of the capital some {{convert|80|km|mi|0}} inland to the [[planned city]] of [[Belmopan]].  In 1978 [[Hurricane Greta-Olivia|Hurricane Greta]] caused more than US$25&nbsp;million in damages along the southern coast. On October 9, 2001, [[Hurricane Iris]] made landfall at [[Monkey River Town]] as a {{convert|145|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} Category Four storm. The storm demolished most of the homes in the village, and destroyed the banana crop. In 2007 [[Hurricane Dean]] made landfall as a Category 5 storm only {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}} north of the Belize–Mexico border. Dean caused extensive damage in northern Belize.  The most recent hurricane to affect Belize directly was the Category 2 [[Hurricane Richard]], making landfall approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}} south-southeast of Belize City at around 00:45 UTC on October 25, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown, Daniel and Berg, Robbie |date=October 25, 2010|title=Hurricane Richard Discussion Seventeen|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=October 25, 2010|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2010/al19/al192010.discus.017.shtml?| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101029230303/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2010/al19/al192010.discus.017.shtml?| archivedate= October 29, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The storm moved inland towards [[Belmopan]], causing estimated damage of [[Belize dollar|BZ$]]33.8&nbsp;million ($17.4&nbsp;million 2010&nbsp;USD), primarily from damage to crops and housing.<ref>[http://www.reporter.bz/?s=33.8 Hurricane Richard gives Belize wake-up call].

BEL was approximately 70% owned by [[Fortis Inc.]], a Canadian investor-owned distribution utility, which represented less than 2% of Fortis assets. Fortis took over the management of BEL in 1999, at the invitation of the government of Belize in an attempt to mitigate prior financial problems within the locally managed utility. In addition to its regulated investment in BEL, Fortis owns Belize Electric Company Limited (BECOL), a non-regulated [[hydroelectric]] generation business that operates three hydroelectric generating facilities on the [[Macal River]].  On June 14, 2011, the government of Belize nationalised the majority ownership interest of Fortis Inc. in Belize Electricity Ltd. The Belize utility encountered serious financial problems after the country's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in 2008 disallowed “the recovery of previously incurred fuel and purchased power costs in customer rates and set customer rates at a level that does not allow BEL to earn a fair and reasonable return”, Fortis said in a June 2011 statement.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.fortisinc.com/News/Pages/Government-of-Belize-Announces-Intent-to-Acquire-Control-of-Belize-Electricity-Limited.aspx|title = Government of Belize Announces Intent to Acquire Control of Belize Electricity Limited|last = |first = |date = June 13, 2011|work = Fortis Inc.|accessdate = }}</ref> BEL appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeal; however, a hearing is not expected until 2012. In May 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Belize]] granted BEL's application to prevent the PUC from taking any enforcement actions pending the appeal. The Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry issued a statement saying the government had acted in haste and expressed concern over the message it sent to investors.  In August 2009, the government of Belize nationalised [[Belize Telemedia Limited]] (BTL), which now competes directly with [[Speednet]]. As a result of the nationalisation process, the [[interconnection]] agreements are again subject to negotiations.

Because [[Roatán]] was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garinagu petitioned the Spanish authorities of Honduras to be allowed to settle on the mainland coast. The Spanish employed them as soldiers, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America. The Garinagu settled in Seine Bight, [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]] and Punta Negra, Belize, by way of Honduras as early as 1802.

Belize possesses about five tertiary level institutions, which offer associates, bachelors, and undergraduate degrees. The only university in the country is the [[University of Belize]], that evolved out of the University College of Belize founded in 1986. Before that [[St. John's College, Belize|St. John's College]], founded in 1877, had dominated the tertiary education field.  Education in Belize is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years. As of 2010, the literacy rate in Belize was estimated at 79.7%,<ref name="census2010"/> one of the [[List of countries by literacy rate|lowest in the Western Hemisphere]].  The educational policy is currently following the "Education Sector Strategy 2011–2016", which sets 3 objectives for the years to come: Improving access, quality, and governance of the education system by providing technical and [[vocational education]] and training.<ref>[http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=BLZ UNESCO-UNEVOC country profile (2013)].

These measures include adding more patrols to "hot spots" in the city, obtaining more resources to deal with the predicament, creating the "Do the Right Thing for Youths at Risk" program, creating the Crime Information Hotline, creating the Yabra Citizen Development Committee, an organisation that helps youth, and many other initiatives. The Belize Police Department began an Anti-Crime Christmas campaign targeting criminals; as a result, the crime rates dropped in that month.<ref name="police2006"/> In 2011, the government established a truce between many major gangs, lowering the murder rate.<ref name="state1"/>  === Social structure === {{Further|Belizean society}}  Belize's social structure is marked by enduring differences in the distribution of wealth, power, and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other [[Caribbean]] and [[Central America]]n societies, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[El Salvador]]. Belize lacks the violent class and racial conflict that has figured so prominently in the social life of its Central American neighbors.<ref name=sbs>Rutheiser, Charles C., "Structure of Belizean Society". In Merrill.</ref>  Political and economic power remain vested in the hands of a relatively small local elite, most of whom are either white, light-skinned [[Creole peoples|Creole]], or [[Mestizo]]. The sizable middle group is composed of peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. This middle group does not constitute a unified [[social class]], but rather a number of middle-class and [[working-class]] groups, loosely oriented around shared dispositions toward education, cultural respectability, and possibilities for upward social mobility. These beliefs and the social practices they engender, help distinguish the middle group from the grass roots majority of the [[Belizean people]].<ref name=sbs/>  ===Women=== In 2012, the [[World Economic Forum]] ranked Belize 102nd out of 135 countries in its [[Global Gender Gap Report]]. Of all the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Belize ranked 3rd from last and had the lowest female-to-male ratio for primary school enrollment.<ref name="ggr">{{cite web|title=The Global Gender Gap Report 2012|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf|publisher=World Economic Forum}}</ref> In 2013, the [[United Nations|UN]] gave Belize a [[Gender Inequality Index]] score of 0.435, ranking it 79th out of 148 countries.<ref name="hdr">{{cite web|title=Human Development Report |url=http://hdr.undp.org/hdr4press/press/report/hdr/english/HDR2013_EN_Complete.pdf |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |year=2013}}</ref>  As of 2013, 48.3% of women in Belize participate in the workforce, compared to 81.8% of men.<ref name="hdr"/> 13.3% of the seats in Belize's [[National Assembly (Belize)|National Assembly]] are filled by women.<ref name="hdr"/>  ==Culture== {{Main|Culture of Belize}}  In Belizean folklore, there are the legends of [[Lang Bobi Suzi]], [[La Llorona]], [[La Sucia]], Luguchu Ellis, [[Tata Duende]], Chatona, [[X'tabai]], [[Anansi]], and the [[cadejo]].  Most of the [[public holidays in Belize]] are traditional Commonwealth and [[liturgical year|Christian holidays]], although some are specific to Belizean culture such as [[Garifuna Settlement Day]] and [[Baron Bliss Day]].<ref>[http://www.belizenet.com "National Holidays of Belize"] Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize. Retrieved February 5, 2008.</ref> In addition, the month of September is considered a [[September Celebrations of Belize|special time of national celebration]]. Besides [[Independence Day]] and St. George's Caye Day, Belizeans also celebrate [[Carnival]] during September, which typically includes several events spread across multiple days. In some areas of Belize, however, Carnival is celebrated at the traditional time before [[Lent]] (in February).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Briceño|first=J.|title=Carnival in Northern Belize|journal=Belizean Studies|year=1981|volume=9|issue=3|pages=1–7}}</ref>  ===Cuisine=== {{Main|Cuisine of Belize}} [[File:Rice and Beans, Stew Chicken and Potato Salad - Belize.jpg|right|thumb|Rice and beans (with coconut milk), stewed recado chicken and potato salad. An inter-ethnic staple meal]] Belizean cuisine is an amalgamation of all ethnicities in the nation, and their respectively wide variety of foods. It might best be described as both similar to Mexican/Central American cuisine and Jamaican/Anglo-Caribbean cuisine.  Breakfast typically consists of bread, flour [[tortilla]]s, or [[fry jack]]s that are often homemade. Fry jacks are eaten with various cheeses, [[refried beans]], various forms of eggs or cereal, along with powdered milk, coffee, or tea. Midday meals vary, from lighter foods such as rice and beans or beans and rice with or without coconut milk, [[tamale]]s, [[empanadas|"panades"]] (fried maize shells with beans or fish), and meat pies, [[escabeche]] (onion soup), [[chimole]] (soup), [[caldo de pollo|caldo]], stewed chicken and garnaches (fried tortillas with beans, cheese, and sauce) to various constituted dinners featuring some type of rice and beans, meat and salad or coleslaw.  In rural areas, meals are typically more simple than in cities. The Maya use [[maize]], [[beans]], or [[Cucurbita|squash]] for most meals, and the Garifuna are fond of seafood, [[cassava]] (particularly made into cassava bread or Ereba) and vegetables. The nation abounds with restaurants and fast food establishments selling fairly cheaply. Local fruits are quite common, but raw vegetables from the markets less so. Mealtime is a communion for families and schools and some businesses close at midday for lunch, reopening later in the afternoon. Steak is also common.  === Music === {{Main|Music of Belize}} [[Punta]] is by the far most popular genre of [[Garifuna music]] and has become the most popular genre in all of Belize.  It is distinctly Afro-Caribbean, and is sometimes said to be ready for international popularization like similarly-descended styles ([[reggae]], [[calypso music|calypso]], [[merengue (music)|merengue]]).  [[Brukdown]] is a very popular modern style of Belizean music related to [[Calypso music|calypso]].  It evolved out of the music and dance of loggers, especially a form called [[buru]]. [[Reggae]], [[dancehall]], and [[Soca music|soca]] imported from [[Jamaica]] and the rest of the [[West Indies]], and [[rapping|rap]], [[hip-hop]], heavy metal and [[rock music]] from the United States, are also popular among the youth of Belize.  ===Sports=== {{Main|Sport in Belize}} [[File:Shalini Zabaneh, Cyclist, Belize.jpg|thumb|right|Accomplished Belizean cyclist, Shalini Zabaneh]] The major sports in Belize are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]] and [[Cycle sport|cycling]], with smaller followings of [[boat racing]], [[track and field]], [[softball]] and [[cricket]]. [[Fishing]] is also popular in coastal areas of Belize. The [[Cross Country Cycling Classic]], also known as the "cross country" race or the Holy Saturday Cross Country Cycling Classic, is considered one of the most important Belize sports events. This one-day sports event is meant for amateur cyclists but has also gained a worldwide popularity.  This cycling event in Belize has seven rider categories based on rider rating, age, and gender. Action-packed and thrilling, this most interesting sporting event allows for the participation of tourists and visitors alike from all over the world. The cycling routes offer views across the resplendent greenery of the forest areas and the meandering rivers. This makes the event even more popular among the tourists.  The history of Cross Country Cycling Classic in Belize dates back to the period when [[Monrad Metzgen]] picked up the idea from a small village on the Northern Highway (now Phillip S. W. Goldson Highway). The people from this village used to cover long distances on their bicycles to attend the weekly game of cricket. He improvised on this observation and added thrill by sowing the idea of a sporting event in the difficult terrain of Western Highways, which were then poorly built.  On Easter day, citizens of Dangriga participate in a yearly fishing tournament. First, second, and third prize are awarded based on a scoring combination of size, species, and number. The tournament is broadcast over local radio stations, and prize money is awarded to the winners.  The [[Belize national basketball team]] is the only National Team that has achieved major victories internationally. During the 1998 Caricom Men's Basketball Championship, held at the Civic Center in Belize City. Belize went on to win the championship and proceeded to participate in the 1999 Centrobasquet Tournament in Havana. The National Team finished seventh of eight teams after winning only 1 game despite playing close all the way. In a return engagement at the 2000 CARICOM championship in Barbados, Belize placed fourth. Shortly thereafter, Belize moved to the Central American region and won the Central American Games championship in 2001.  The team has failed to duplicate this success, most recently finishing with a 2 and 4 record in the 2006 COCABA championship. The team finished second in the 2009 COCABA tournament in Cancun, Mexico where it went 3–0 in group play. Belize won its opening match in the Centrobasquet Tournament, 2010, defeating Trinidad and Tobago, but lost badly to Mexico in a rematch of the COCABA final. A tough win over Cuba set Belize in position to advance, but they fell to Puerto Rico in their final match and failed to qualify.  ===National symbols=== [[File:Ramphastos sulfuratus -Belize Zoo-6a-2c.jpg|thumb|The [[Ramphastos sulfuratus|keel-billed toucan]]]] [[File:Tapirus bairdii -Franklin Park Zoo, Massachusetts, USA-8a.jpg|thumb|The [[Tapirus bairdii|Baird's tapir]]]] The national flower of Belize is the black orchid (''[[Prosthechea cochleata]]'', also known as ''Encyclia cochleata'').<ref name=symbols>{{Wayback |date=20081202032835 |url=http://belizeconsulatela.org/nationalsymbols.html |title="National Symbols of Belize" }}.

Retrieved February 5, 2008.</ref>  The national tree of Belize is the [[mahogany]] tree (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), one of the magnificent giants of the Belize rain forest. Rising straight and tall to over a hundred feet from great buttresses at the roots, it emerges above the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of the surrounding trees with a crown of large, shining green leaves.  In the early months of the year, when the leaves fall and new red-brown growth appears, the tree can be spotted from a great distance. The tree puts out a great flush of small whitish flowers—the blossom for dark fruits, which are pear-shaped capsules about six inches long. When the fruits mature, they split into five valves, which frees large winged seeds that are carried away by the wind. They fall on the shaded protection of the forest floor and germinate to begin a new life cycle. The mahogany tree matures in 60 to 80 years.  British settlers exploited the Belizean forest for mahogany, beginning around the middle of the 17th century. It was originally exported to the United Kingdom in the form of squared logs, but shipments now consist mainly of sawn lumber. The motto "Sub Umbra Florero" means: Under the shade (of the mahogany tree) I flourish.<ref name=symbols/>  The keel-billed toucan (''[[Ramphastos sulfuratus]]'') is the national bird of Belize. It is noted for its great, canoe-shaped bill and its brightly coloured green, blue, red and orange feathers.  Toucans make a monotonous frog-like croak. They like fruit, and eat by cutting with the serrated edge of their bills. Toucans nest in holes in trees, using natural holes or holes made by woodpeckers, often enlarging the cavity by removing soft, rotten wood. They lay two to four eggs, which both parents incubate. The nesting stage lasts from six to seven weeks.  Belize's national animal is the [[Baird's tapir]], the largest land mammal of the American tropics. It is also known as the mountain cow, although it is actually related to the horse and the [[rhinoceros]]. It is protected under Belizean law. {{clear}}  ==See also== {{portal|Geography|Central America|Caribbean Community|Commonwealth realms|Belize}} *[[Belizean people]] *[[Index of Belize-related articles]] *[[Outline of Belize]] *''[[The Forgotten District]]'' – a documentary on Maya ecotourism in southern Belize {{clear}}  ==Notes== {{reflist|group=note}}  ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}  ==Further reading== * [http://www.mnrei.gov.bz Belize Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment] / [http://www.servir.net SERVIR].
