  This article includes several chronologies relating to J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. In Tolkien's cosmology, Arda (the Earth) is at first created without the Sun and Moon to illumine it, and its earliest history is measured in Valian Years (V.Y.). After the creation of the Trees of the Valar, a new tally of Years of the Trees is begun in V.Y. 3501. In about V.Y. 4550, at the First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar begins with the Awakening of the Elves. The Years of the Sun begin with the Awakening of Men in about V.Y. 5000.  From this time, First Age lasts for another 590 years. The Second Age extends to 3441 years, beginning with the foundation of  Mithlond (the Grey Havens) under Círdan, and Lindon as the Noldorin Kingdom under Gil-galad, and ending with the defeat of Sauron at the hands of the  Last Alliance of Elves and Men. The Third Age extends to 3021 years, ending with the final defeat of Sauron in the War of the Ring and the establishment of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor.. The Fourth Age is outside the scope of Tolkien's legendarium, beginning the suggested transition to the historical period, but Tolkien gives a summary of the first two centuries of the Fourth Age.in a letter written in 1958, published in , Tolkien places the beginning of the Fourth Age some 6,000 years in the past, consistent with the scope of classical historiography reaching back to just after the beginning  Dominion of Men: "I imagine the gap [since the end of the Third Age] to be about 6000 years; that is we are now at the end of the Fifth Age, if the Ages were of about the same length as S[econd] A[ge] and T[hird] A[ge]. But they have, I think, quickened; and I imagine we are actually at the end of the Sixth Age, or in the Seventh." Timeline entries are based on  The Annals of Aman (published 1993) and The Grey Annals (published 1994) and Appendix B of The Lord of the Rings (published 1955)  unless otherwise noted. Tolkien revised his chronology numerous times. The Annals of Valinor were written in the early 1930s.  In this early version, a Valian Year corresponds to 10 solar years, and the time from the creation of Arda until the creation of Sun and Moon is 3,000 Valian Years. In a revision dated c. 1937, the earlier timeline is mostly left intact, with the addition of the explicit statement that  "It is said that the Valar came into the world 30,000 Sun-years ere the first rising of the Moon". The chronology underwent major revisions after the publication of The Lord of the Rings, in about 1958. In this revision, published as the Annals of Aman, Tolkien defined a Valian Year as equal to 9.852 solar years, and the  Valian Year of the creation of Sun and Moon was now given as 5000, so that the time between the creation of Arda and the rising of the Sun and Moon was now the equivalent of 47,910 solar years instead of 30,000. Late in his life, Tolkien planned to again revise chronology, now assuming one Valian Year as the equivalent of 144 solar years. This is consistent with his earlier decision (published in 1955 in Appendix D of The Lord of the Rings) that the Elves would reckon time in "long-years" or yéni equivalent to 144 solar years (thus equating the yéni and the Valian Year), but Tolkien never finished this final revision. Before the making of the Sun dates are given in Valian Years and not all events can be precisely dated. In such cases events are given in chronological order between known dates. Although all dates prior to the first sunrise have been given in Valian years, these can be converted to Years of the Lamps by subtracting 1900, Years of the Trees by subtracting 3500, or Years of the Trees in the First Age by subtracting 4550. The conversion between Valian Years and Years of the Sun is not clear, depending on  the choice of conversion factors (among many that Tolkien used at different times), the First Age may have lasted anywhere between 4,902 and 65,390 sun years. The greater number is supported by the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings and later writings, the lesser by earlier writings.  In Morgoth's Ring, Christopher Toklkien cites a passage stating a Valian Year being "longer than are now nine years under the Sun." "Time indeed began with the beginning of Eä, and in that beginning the Valar came into the world. But the measurement which the Valar made of the ages of their labours is not known to any of the Children of Ilúvatar, until the first flowering of Telperion in Valinor. Thereafter the Valar counted time by the ages of Valinor, whereof each age contained one hundred of the Years of the Valar; but each such year was longer than are now nine years under the Sun." In some cases, after V.Y. 4580, exact chronological order cannot be determined and the placement of undated entries is estimated. During the Years of the Trees the First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar begins, at the Awakening of the Elves. From this time on years are of normal length. Events from Valinor during the Years of the Sun cannot be accurately dated. All entries are derived from The Grey Annals (see references) unless otherwise noted. The dating begins anew at 1, although these years are still held to be part of the First Age. From this point the entries are derived from The Tale of Years of the First Age (see references) unless otherwise noted. The Second Age was 3441 years long. All entries are derived from Appendix B (see references) unless otherwise noted. The Third Age was 3,021 years long. All entries are derived from Appendix B (see references) unless otherwise noted. Note on Shire Reckoning: Year 1601 of the Third Age, in which the Shire was founded, is year 1 of the Shire Reckoning. Thus, Third Age years can be converted into their Shire equivalents by deducting 1600. All entries are derived from Appendix B (see references) unless otherwise noted. Length uncertain. All entries are derived from the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, unless otherwise noted. In the reckoning of Gondor, the Fourth Age began on 'March' 25, T.A. 3021. Since most of the following events had been dated according to the Shire-reckoning, their years in the Fourth Age cannot be stated with certainty. Some events may have occurred in the following year of the Fourth Age. Years of the Trees Years of the Sun See also Battles of Beleriand.
