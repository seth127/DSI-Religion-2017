   Classical elements typically refer to ancient concepts similar to the modern states of matter: earth  (solid), water (liquid), air (gas) and fire (plasma). Classical elements are the simplest form of existence, of everything in existence. Many philosophies and worldviews believe in classical elements. Historians trace the evolution of modern theory of chemical elements, chemical compounds, and chemical substance mixtures, to [[#Medieval classic element systems|medieval]] and Greek models.  Many concepts once thought to be [[Analogous structure|analogous]], such as the Chinese [[Wu Xing]], are now understood more figuratively.  ==Ancient== {{anchor|Ancient classic element systems}} In classical thought, the four elements [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] frequently occur; sometimes including a fifth element or ''quintessence'' (after "quint" meaning "fifth") called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] in ancient Greece and ''akasha'' in India. The concept of the five elements formed a basis of analysis in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In Hinduism, particularly in an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] context, the four states-of-matter describe matter, and a fifth element describes that which was beyond the material world. Similar lists existed in ancient [[China]] and [[Japan]]. In Buddhism the four great elements, to which two others are sometimes added, are not viewed as substances, but as categories of [[sensory experience]].  ===Cosmic elements in Babylonia=== In [[Babylonian mythology]], the cosmogony called ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', a text written between the 18th and 16th centuries BC, involves four gods that we might see as personified cosmic elements: sea, earth, sky, wind. In other Babylonian texts these phenomena are considered independent of their association with deities,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A consideration of Babylonian astronomy within the historiography of science|author=Francesca Rochberg|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=33|issue=4|date=December 2002|pages=661–684|doi=10.1016/S0039-3681(02)00022-5|postscript=.}}</ref> though they are not treated as the component elements of the universe, as later in [[Empedocles]].  ==Greece== {{anchor|Classical elements in Greece}}  <div style="font-size:80%;float:right;clear:left;margin-left:1em;"> {|align="center" class="toccolours" style="width:220px; float:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em;" | style="background:#c9b59d; text-align:center;" | '''Aristotelian elements and qualities''' |- | style="text-align:center;" | [[File:Four elements representation.svg|center|200px|Four Classical Elements]] <br style="clear:both;"> ''Empedoclean elements'' <br style="clear:both;"> [[File:Alchemy fire symbol.svg|20px]] [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] {{·}} [[File:Alchemy earth symbol.svg|20px]] [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]  <br /> [[File:Alchemy water symbol.svg|20px]] [[Water (classical element)|water]] {{·}} [[File:Alchemy air symbol.svg|20px]] [[Air (classical element)|air]] |} </div> The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] belief in five basic elements, these being earth (γῆ  ''ge''), water (ὕδωρ ''hudor''), air (ἀήρ ''aer''), fire (πῦρ ''pur'') and aether (αἰθήρ ''aither''), dates from pre-Socratic times and persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], deeply influencing [[Europe]]an thought and culture. These five elements are sometimes associated with the five [[platonic solid]]s.  [[Magna Graecia|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]] (ca. 450 BC) proved (at least to his satisfaction) that air was a separate substance by observing that a bucket inverted in water did not become filled with water, a pocket of air remaining trapped inside.<ref>Russell, p. 72</ref>  Prior to Empodocles, Greek philosophers had debated which substance was the primordial element from which everything else was made; [[Heraclitus]] championed fire, [[Thales]] supported water, and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] plumped for air.<ref>Russell, p. 61</ref> [[Anaximander]] argued that the primordial substance was not any of the known substances, but could be transformed into them, and they into each other.<ref>Russell, p. 46</ref>  Empedocles was the first to propose four elements, fire, earth, air, and water.<ref>Russell, pp. 62, 75</ref>  He called them the four "roots" (ῥιζὤματα, rhizōmata).

The three metallic principles—sulphur to flammability or combustion, mercury to volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] to solidity—became the ''tria prima'' of the Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]]. He reasoned that Aristotle’s four element theory appeared in bodies as three principles. Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental and justified them by recourse to the description of how wood burns in fire. Mercury included the cohesive principle, so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart. Smoke described the volatility (the mercurial principle), the heat-giving flames described flammability (sulphur), and the remnant ash described solidity (salt).<ref>Strathern, 2000. Page 79.</ref>  ==Egypt== {{anchor|Classical elements in Egypt}} A Greek text called the ''Kore Kosmou'' ("Virgin of the World") ascribed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (the name given by the Greeks to the Egyptian god [[Thoth]]), names the four elements fire, water, air, and earth. As described in this book:  <blockquote>And Isis answer made: Of living things, my son, some are made friends with ''fire'', and some with ''water'', some with ''air'', and some with ''earth'', and some with two or three of these, and some with all. And, on the contrary, again some are made enemies of fire, and some of water, some of earth, and some of air, and some of two of them, and some of three, and some of all. For instance, son, the locust and all flies flee fire; the eagle and the hawk and all high-flying birds flee water; fish, air and earth; the snake avoids the open air. Whereas snakes and all creeping things love earth; all swimming things love water; winged things, air, of which they are the citizens; while those that fly still higher love the fire and have the habitat near it. Not that some of the animals as well do not love fire; for instance salamanders, for they even have their homes in it. It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies' outer envelope. Each [[soul]], accordingly, while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four.</blockquote>  According to [[Galen]], these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] in describing the [[human body]] with an association with the [[Humorism|four humours]]: yellow [[bile]] (fire), [[Melancholia|black bile]] (earth), [[blood]] (air), and [[phlegm]] (water).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  ==India== {{classic element}}  ===Hinduism=== {{anchor|Classical elements in Hinduism}} {{anchor|The 5 Elements of Nature}} {{Main|Mahābhūta|Guṇa}}  The system of five elements are found in [[Vedas]], especially [[Ayurveda]], the ''[[Pancha Bhoota|pancha mahabhuta]]'', or "five great elements", of [[Hinduism]] are ''[[bhūmi]]'' ([[earth (classical element)|earth]]),<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 78|editor=K.S.

In early Buddhism, the four elements are a basis for understanding suffering and for liberating oneself from suffering. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the sensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterization as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, is declared an abstraction{{spaced ndash}}instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one observes how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lusthaus|first1=Dan|title=What is and isn't Yogācāra|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro.html}}</ref>  The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s teaching regarding the four elements is to be understood as the base of all observation of real sensations rather than as a philosophy. The four properties are cohesion (water), solidity or inertia (earth), expansion or vibration (air) and heat or energy content (fire). He promulgated a categorization of mind and matter as composed of eight types of "[[kalapas]]" of which the four elements are primary and a secondary group of four are color, smell, taste, and nutriment which are derivative from the four primaries.  [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] (1997) renders an extract of [[Shakyamuni Buddha]]'s from Pali into English thus: {{quote|Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces, the monk contemplates this very body&nbsp;– however it stands, however it is disposed&nbsp;– in terms of properties: 'In this body there is the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, & the wind property.'<ref>{{cite web|title=''Kayagata-sati Sutta'' |author=[[Majjhima Nikaya]] |page=119 |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.119.than.html |accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref>}}  Tibetan Buddhist medical literature speaks of the Panch [[Mahābhūta]] (five elements).<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gurmet | first = Padma | title = 'Sowa - Rigpa' : Himalayan art of healing | journal = Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–218 | date = 2004 | url = http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/9345}}</ref>  ===Seven chakras=== In the philosophy of the seven [[chakras]] there are correspondences to the five elements as shared by both Hinduism and Buddhism as well as two other elements:<ref>{{cite book|title=Vibrational Energy Medicine|publisher=pedipress|author=Fernando Guimaraes|page=50}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=this is a book promoting fringe ideas, not a scholarly work on historical philosophies|date=October 2014}}  * Sahasrara (Crown): Emptiness/Wisdom/Timeless/Notionless/Neither meaningful nor meaningless/Neither limited nor non-limited * Ajna (Third Eye): Totality/Cosmos/Balance/Magic/Black Magic * Vishuddhi (Throat): Aether/Light/Life/Lightning/Electricity/Energy/Magnetism * Anahata (Heart): Air/Wind/Magic/Sound/Music * Manipura (Navel): Fire/Heat/Flame * Svadhisthana (Sacral): Water/Ice/Snow/Steam/Fog/Mist * Muladhara (Root): Earth/Rock/Nature/Soil/Metal/Wood{{citation needed|reason=Need source associating specific elements with chakras|date=October 2014}}  ==Tibet== {{anchor|Bön elements}} In [[Bön]] or ancient Tibetan philosophy, the five elemental processes of [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Void (classical element)|space]] are the essential materials of all existent [[phenomena]] or [[skandha|aggregate]]s.  The elemental processes form the basis of the [[calendar]], [[astrology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]] and are the foundation of the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[traditions]] of [[shamanism]], [[tantra]] and [[Dzogchen]].  [[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] states that {{quote|physical properties are assigned to the elements:  earth is solidity; water is cohesion; fire is temperature; air is motion; and space is the spatial dimension that accommodates the other four active elements.  In addition, the elements are correlated to different emotions, temperaments, directions, colors, tastes, body types, illnesses, thinking styles, and character.  From the five elements arise the five senses and the five fields of sensory experience; the five negative emotions and the five wisdoms; and the five extensions of the body.  They are the five primary ''pranas'' or vital energies.  They are the constituents of every physical, sensual, mental, and spiritual phenomenon.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche |title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light |page=1 |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |isbn=1-55939-176-6 |year=2002}}</ref>}}  The names of the elements are analogous to categorised experiential sensations of the natural world.  The [[name]]s are [[symbol]]ic and key to their inherent qualities and/or modes of action by [[analogy]].  In [[Bön]] the elemental processes are fundamental [[metaphor]]s for working with external, internal and secret energetic forces.  All five elemental processes in their essential purity are inherent in the [[mindstream]] and link the [[trikaya]] and are aspects of primordial energy. As [[Herbert V. Günther]] states: {{quote|Thus, bearing in mind that thought struggles incessantly against the treachery of language and that what we observe and describe is the observer himself, we may nonetheless proceed to investigate the successive phases in our becoming human beings. Throughout these phases, the experience (''das Erlebnis'') of ourselves as an intensity (imaged and felt as a "god", lha) setting up its own spatiality (imaged and felt as a "house" ''khang'') is present in various intensities of illumination that occur within ourselves as a "temple." A corollary of this Erlebnis is its light character manifesting itself in various "frequencies" or colors. This is to say, since we are beings of light we display this light in a multiplicity of nuances.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herber V.

Although it is usually translated as "element", the Chinese word ''xing'' literally means something like "changing states of being", "permutations" or "metamorphoses of being".<ref>{{cite book|author=Wolfram Eberhard |title=A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols |pages=93, 105, 309 |publisher=Routledge and Keegan Paul |location=London |year=1986|isbn=0-7102-0191-5}}</ref> In fact [[Sinologists]] cannot agree on any single translation. The Chinese elements were seen as ever changing and moving{{spaced ndash}}one translation of ''wu xing'' is simply "the five changes".  The Wu Xing are chiefly an ancient mnemonic device for systems with five stages; hence the preferred translation of "movements", "phases" or "steps" over "elements."  In the [[bagua]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|metal]] is associated with the divination figure 兌 ''Duì'' (☱, the lake or marsh: 澤/泽 ''zé'') and with 乾 ''Qián'' (☰, the sky or heavens: 天 ''tiān''). [[Wood (Wu Xing)|Wood]] is associated with 巽 ''Xùn'' (☴, the wind: 風/风 ''fēng'') and with 震 ''Zhèn'' (☳, the arousing/thunder: 雷 ''léi''). In view of the durability of meteoric iron, metal came to be associated with the [[aether (classical element)|aether]], which is sometimes conflated with [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[pneuma]], as both terms originally referred to air (the former being higher, brighter, more fiery or celestial and the latter being merely warmer, and thus [[vitalism|vital]] or [[abiogenesis|biogenetic]]). In [[Taoism]], ''[[qi]]'' functions similarly to pneuma in a prime matter (a basic principle of energetic transformation) that accounts for both biological and inanimate phenomena.  In Chinese philosophy the universe consists of heaven and earth. The five major [[planet]]s are associated with and even named after the elements: [[Jupiter]] 木星 is Wood ([[wikt:木#Han character|木]]), [[Mars]] 火星 is Fire ([[wikt:火#Han character|火]]), [[Saturn]] 土星 is Earth ([[wikt:土#Han character|土]]), [[Venus]] 金星 is Metal ([[wikt:金#Han character|金]]), and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] 水星 is Water ([[wikt:水#Han character|水]]). Also, the [[Moon]] represents [[Yin and yang|Yin]] ([[wikt:陰#Han character|陰]]), and the [[Sun]] 太陽 represents [[Yin and yang|Yang]] ([[wikt:陽#Han character|陽]]). Yin, Yang, and the five elements are associated with themes in the [[I Ching]], the oldest of Chinese classical texts which describes an ancient system of [[cosmology]] and [[philosophy]]. The five elements also play an important part in [[Chinese astrology]] and the Chinese form of [[geomancy]] known as [[Feng shui]].  The doctrine of five phases describes two cycles of balance, a generating or creation (生, shēng) cycle and an overcoming or destruction (克/剋, kè) cycle of interactions between the phases.  ''Generating'' * Wood feeds fire; * Fire creates earth (ash); * Earth bears metal; * Metal collects water; * Water nourishes wood.  ''Overcoming'' * Wood parts earth; * Earth absorbs water; * Water quenches fire; * Fire melts metal; * Metal chops wood.  There are also two cycles of imbalance, an overacting cycle (cheng) and an insulting cycle (wu).  ==Japan== {{anchor|Japanese elements}} {{Main|Five elements (Japanese philosophy)}} [[Japan]]ese traditions use a set of elements called the {{lang|ja|五大}} (''godai'', literally "five great"). These five are [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wind (classical element)|wind]]/air, and [[Aether (classical element)|void]]. These came from Indian [[Vastu shastra]] philosophy and Buddhist beliefs; in addition, the classical Chinese elements ({{lang|ja|五行}}, ''wu xing'') are also prominent in Japanese culture, especially to the influential Neo-Confucianists during the [[Edo period]].  * '''Earth''' represented things that were solid. * '''Water''' represented things that were liquid. * '''Fire''' represented things that destroy. * '''Air''' represented things that moved. * '''Void''' or '''Sky/Heaven''' represented things not of our everyday life.  ==Western astrology and tarot== {{anchor|Elements in western astrology and tarot}} {{Main|astrology and the classical elements|divinatory tarot}} Western [[astrology]] uses the four [[astrology and the classical elements|classical elements]] in connection with [[natal chart|astrological chart]]s and [[horoscopes]].
