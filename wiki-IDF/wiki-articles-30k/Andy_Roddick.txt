    Andrew Stephen "Andy" Roddick (born August 30, 1982) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. He became a Grand Slam singles champion when he won the title at the 2003 US Open, defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final. He is the most recent North American male player to win a Grand Slam singles event, the most recent to reach the top ranking, and the most recent to claim the year-end world No. 1 (2003). Roddick reached four other Grand Slam finals (Wimbledon in 2004, 2005, and 2009, and the US Open in 2006), losing to Roger Federer every time. He is married to Brooklyn Decker, a Sports Illustrated swimwear model and actress. On August 30, 2012, during the 2012 US Open and on his 30th birthday, Roddick announced that he would retire after the tournament. Following a fourth-round defeat by Juan Martín del Potro, Roddick retired from the sport with the aim of focusing on his foundation, the Andy Roddick Foundation, in future years. Andy Roddick is currently playing for the Austin Aces in World Team Tennis. This is his eighth season in World Team Tennis and the fifth team he has played for. Roddick was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Blanche (Corell), a school teacher, and Jerry Roddick, a businessman.http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11101734.html Roddick has two older brothers, Lawrence and John (All-American tennis player at University of Georgia [1996–98] and head tennis coach at the University of Oklahoma), who were both promising tennis players at a young age. Roddick lived in Austin, Texas, from age 4 until he was 11, and then moved to Boca Raton, Florida, in the interest of his brother's tennis career, attending Boca Prep International School, and graduating in the Class of 2000. Roddick played varsity basketball in high school alongside his future Davis Cup teammate Mardy Fish, who trained and lived with Roddick in 1999. During that time period, he intermittently trained with Venus and Serena Williams; he later moved back to Austin. His tennis idol growing up was Andre Agassi. Roddick considered quitting competitive tennis at the age of 17, when he had a losing streak in the juniors. His coach, Tarik Benhabiles, talked him into giving tennis four more months of undivided attention. Roddick finished as the No. 6 junior in the U.S. in 1999, and as the No. 1 junior in the world in 2000. He won six world junior singles titles and seven world junior doubles titles, and won the US Open and Australian Open junior singles titles in 2000. In March in Miami, in the first round Roddick had his first ATP level victory as he beat World No. 41 Fernando Vicente of Spain, 6–4, 6–0. In August in Washington, D.C., he beat World No. 30 Fabrice Santoro of France, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3. Roddick played the Banana Bowl in the city of São Paulo and won, beating Joachim Johansson in the final.38º Banana Bowl  Roddick also won the Australian Junior Open, defeating Mario Ančić in the final. In 2001, Roddick defeated former French Open champion Michael Chang in five sets in the second round of the tournament, despite the fact that clay was Roddick's worst surface. During the following Wimbledon, he further showed potential by taking a set from eventual winner Goran Ivanišević. At the age of 18, he also defeated 7-time Wimbledon champion, World No. 4, and fellow American Pete Sampras at the Miami Masters 7–6, 6–3, and World No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, 6–7, 6–4, 6–2, in August. Roddick's breakthrough year was 2003, in which he defeated Younes El Aynaoui in the quarterfinals of the 2003 Australian Open. Roddick and the Moroccan battled for five hours, with the fifth set (21–19 in favor of Roddick) at the time the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam tournament during the open era, at 2 hours and 23 minutes. Despite a lackluster French Open, Roddick enjoyed success in the United Kingdom by winning Queen's Club, beating World No. 2 Andre Agassi, 6–1, 6–7, 7–6, along the way, and reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, where he lost to eventual champion Roger Federer in straight sets. He avenged that loss in August, beating then World No. 3 Federer in Montreal, 6–4, 3–6, 7–6. It is one of three times that Roddick defeated Federer in an official ATP tournament. Roddick's hard-court record in 2003 included his first Masters Series titles—coming at Canada and Cincinnati—and his only Grand Slam title. At the US Open, Roddick rallied from two sets down and a match point in the semifinals to beat David Nalbandian of Argentina, 6–7, 3–6, 7–6, 6–1, 6–3. He then defeated World No. 3 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final, 6–3, 7–6, 6–3. At the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston, he defeated World No. 7 Carlos Moyá of Spain, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, and World No. 4 Guillermo Coria of Argentina, 6–3, 6–7, 6–3, before losing to Roger Federer in the semifinals. By the end of the year, at age 21, he was ranked No. 1, the first American to finish a year at No. 1 since Andre Agassi in 1999. He also became the youngest American to hold this rank since computer rankings were started in 1973. Roddick's reign at No. 1 ended the following February, when Roger Federer ascended to the top position, after winning his first Australian Open; the 2004 Australian Open would be the only time in Roddick's career that he was the No. 1 seed in a Grand Slam. In April, Roddick again beat World No. 6 Moyá, this time 5–7, 6–2, 7–5. In June, Roddick advanced to his first Wimbledon final, and after taking the first set from defending champion Federer, lost in four sets. Roddick was knocked out during the 2004 US Open in a five-set quarterfinal against another big server, Joachim Johansson. Later in September in Bangkok, he beat world no. 9 Marat Safin of Russia, 7–6, 6–7, 7–6. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Roddick lost to Chilean Fernando González, the eventual bronze medal winner, in the third round. In November he beat World No. 7 Tim Henman of Great Britain, 7–5, 7–6, World No. 4 Safin, 7–6, 7–6, and World No. 6 Guillermo Coria, 7–6, 6–3. Later that year, Roddick teamed up with Mardy Fish and Bob and Mike Bryan on the U.S. Davis Cup team that lost to Spain in the final in Seville. Roddick lost his singles match against Rafael Nadal, who would in the following year win the French Open. Towards the end of 2004, Roddick fired his coach of 18 months, Brad Gilbert, and hired assistant Davis Cup coach Dean Goldfine. Roddick finished 2004 ranked as the World No. 2, the U.S. No. 1, and the player with the most aces (2,017). In 2004, Roddick saved fellow tennis player Sjeng Schalken and other guests (including close friends Ben Campezi and Dean Monroe) from a hotel fire. Roddick's first 2005 tournament victory was the SAP Open in San Jose, California, where he became the first to win the event in consecutive years since Mark Philippoussis in 1999 and 2000. The top-seeded Roddick defeated Cyril Saulnier, 6–0, 6–4, in 50 minutes, the event's first championship shutout set since Arthur Ashe beat Guillermo Vilas in 1975. In March, he defeated world no. 7 Carlos Moyá, 6–7, 6–4, 6–1. In April, Roddick won the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championships, reclaiming the title he won in 2001 and 2002. (He lost in 2003 to Agassi, and in 2004 to Tommy Haas.) In May, Roddick had match point against Spain's Fernando Verdasco. Verdasco was attempting to save the match point on his second serve, when the linesman erroneously called the serve out. If this call had held, Roddick would have won the match. Roddick motioned to the umpire, pointing to the clear ball mark on the clay indicating the ball was in, and the call was consequently changed. Verdasco went on to win the match. At the French Open, Roddick lost to unseeded Argentine José Acasuso in the second round, and at Wimbledon, Roddick lost to Federer in the final for the second consecutive year. In August, he defeated world no. 3 Lleyton Hewitt, 6–4, 7–6, at the Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Roddick was defeated by world no. 70 Gilles Müller in the first round. Roddick's most recent US Open first-round loss had been in 2000. At the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, Roddick defeated Gaël Monfils to wrap up a tournament without losing a set or getting his serve broken. Roddick's first ATP event of the year was the Australian Open. There, he reached the fourth round, before being upset by unseeded and eventual finalist, Marcos Baghdatis. At the French Open, Roddick retired in the first round, after sustaining a foot injury during the match. Two weeks later at Wimbledon, Roddick was upset in the third round by British hopeful Andy Murray. This loss caused Roddick to fall below the top 10 for the first time since 2002. After Wimbledon, Roddick began working with a new coach, tennis legend Jimmy Connors. In his first event with his new coach, Roddick reached the final of Indianapolis, before losing to good friend and fellow American, James Blake. His resurgence finally came at the Cincinnati Masters, where he won the event by defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final, making this the first masters event he won since 2004. At the US Open, Roddick easily won his first two matches against Florent Serra and Kristian Pless. He then played a thriller five-set match against Fernando Verdasco, winning 6–2 in the final set. Next, he beat Benjamin Becker, who was coming off a huge win against recently retired Andre Agassi. In the quarterfinals, Roddick beat Lleyton Hewitt, avenging his loss in 2001, 6–3, 7–5, 6–4. Now in the semifinals for the first time since he won in 2003, Roddick played Mikhail Youzhny and beat him, 6–7, 6–0, 7–6, 6–3. In the finals of a Grand Slam for the first time since Wimbledon a year prior, Roddick played world no. 1 Federer. He lost, however, 2–6, 6–4, 5–7, 1–6. He then qualified for the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, where he defeated world no. 4 Ivan Ljubičić of Croatia, 6–4, 6–7, 6–1, but lost in the round robin to world no. 1 Federer, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, in a tough three-set battle. Roddick entered the 2007 Australian Open as the sixth seed. In his first-round match, he lost a marathon first-set tiebreak 20–18, but eventually won the match in four sets against wild card Jo-Wilfried Tsonga from France. Roddick defeated 26th-seeded Marat Safin in the third round, and ninth-seeded Mario Ančić in a five-set fourth-round match. Roddick won his quarterfinal match against fellow American Mardy Fish, 6–2, 6–2, 6–2. His run was ended in the semifinals by world no. 1 Federer, who defeated him in straight sets, 6–4, 6–0, 6–2, making his head-to-head record against Federer 1–13. In first-round Davis Cup action, Roddick helped the US defeat the Czech Republic, winning his singles matches against Ivo Minář and Tomáš Berdych. Roddick reached at least the semifinals of his next two tournaments. He bowed out to Andy Murray in the semifinals of the SAP Open in San Jose, California, a reprise of 2006. Roddick then defeated Murray in the semifinals of the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup in Memphis, Tennessee, before losing in the final to defending champion Tommy Haas, 6–3, 6–2. Reaching the final, however, enabled Roddick to overtake Nikolay Davydenko for the world no. 3 position, his first week inside the top three since March 6, 2006. At the first ATP Masters Series tournament of the year, after beating world no. 8 Ivan Ljubičić, 6–4, 6–7, 6–1, Roddick reached the semifinals of the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, but lost to world no. 2 Rafael Nadal, 6–4, 6–3. Roddick then played the Miami Masters, where he gave up in his quarterfinal match against Andy Murray due to a left hamstring injury. Roddick then helped the U.S. defeat Spain and advance to the Davis Cup semifinals, winning his lone singles match against Fernando Verdasco, 7–6, 6–1, 6–4. However, Roddick re-aggravated his hamstring injury during the Davis Cup tie, and was subsequently forced to pull out of the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas. Roddick also announced that he would withdraw from the Monte Carlo Masters, citing the injury. His next tournament was the Internazionali d'Italia. After a first-round bye, he won his first match against Gastón Gaudio, where he saved three break points and fired nine aces. However, he was unable to stop Juan Ignacio Chela in the third round, losing 6–0, 6–4. Roddick then withdrew from the Masters Series Hamburg tournament because, according to his website, he needed time to physically prepare himself for the upcoming French Open. Roddick was seeded third at the French Open, but was eliminated in the first round by Russian Igor Andreev in four sets, 6–3, 4–6, 3–6, 4–6. Roddick was victorious at the Stella Artois Championships for the fourth time, when he defeated Nicolas Mahut in the final, 4–6, 7–6, 7–6.

He reached the quarterfinals after wins against Justin Gimelstob of the U.S., Danai Udomchoke of Thailand, Fernando Verdasco of Spain, and Paul-Henri Mathieu of France. In the quarterfinals, Roddick lost in five close sets to Richard Gasquet of France, 6–4, 6–4, 6–7, 6–7, 6–8.  During the summer hardcourt season, Roddick played four tournaments in four weeks.

There were no breaks of serve and only one break point total in the first two sets, that being on Federer's serve. Two weeks later, Roddick anchored the U.S. Davis Cup team during its 4–1 semifinal defeat of Sweden. Roddick won both his singles matches, opening the tie with a defeat of Joachim Johansson, 7–6, 7–6, 6–3, and clinching it with a 6–2, 7–6, 6–4 victory over Jonas Björkman. This was the ninth time in nine tries that Roddick had clinched a tie for the American team. Roddick then set his sights on the Madrid Masters, but pulled out, citing a knee injury. At his next tournament two weeks later in Lyon, France, Roddick lost in the first round to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, 7–6, 2–6, 6–4. Roddick then withdrew from the Paris Masters, incurring a $22,600 fine for not fulfilling his media obligations at the tournament.

Roddick defeated Mardy Fish and Andy Murray, before losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. At Wimbledon, Roddick was beaten by Serbia's Janko Tipsarević, 6–7, 7–5, 6–4, 7–6.

Four days after his loss, Roddick received a special ceremony in the Arthur Ashe Stadium due to his retirement, in which Andre Agassi participated. Due to his retirement, he ended the year at 39, the lowest he has been since 2000, the year he turned pro, when he only played 5 events. Andy played one tournament on tour: the 2015 BB&T Atlanta Open, where he competed in the men's doubles event with Mardy Fish. They lost in the quarterfinals.  Roddick is often called "A-Rod", a play on the nickname of New York Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez, referring to his first initial and the first three letters of his last name. Roddick made frequent outbursts against umpires and linesmen on the court. During his third-round match at the Australian Open in 2008, he abused umpire Emmanuel Joseph saying, "You're an idiot! Stay in school kids or you'll end up being an umpire." He lost his temper again at the 2010 Australian Open, after a ball which he did not play was called out on match point, but ruled to be in after a video review.  He continued arguing with the umpire after the conclusion of the match but later said that he had been wrong.  Later again that year launched into a tirade at an official over a foot fault call, at the 2010 US Open, a match he eventually lost to Serbia's Janko Tipsarević. 2011 saw Roddick snap at the chair umpire at Indian Wells on his way to losing to Richard Gasquet. In a second round match against Philipp Kohlschreiber at the 2011 Cincinnati Masters, Roddick was given a penalty point, which resulted in a critical break of serve in favor of his opponent. The penalty point was given due to ball abuse, when Roddick smashed a ball into the stands in frustration after he had already been warned earlier in the match by umpire Carlos Bernardes for an episode of racquet abuse. This triggered another series of altercations with the umpire, with Roddick expressing his displeasure at the umpire's call. Roddick lost the match. At the 2011 China Open in Beijing, Andy Roddick was asked by the Chinese press about his potential retirement, given his drop in the rankings. Roddick refused to answer and left the session abruptly. Roddick, however, is also known for his funny on-court behavior and witty answers off-court in interviews and press conferences. He and Novak Djokovic are especially known for imitating players, with both doing impersonations of Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, and each other. Roddick was also coached by Jimmy Connors for two years, who was known for his flamboyant personality during his playing career. Roddick uses a discontinued version of the Babolat Pure Drive, extended to 27.5&nbsp;inches. The racquet itself is heavily customised with additional weight placed in the head via the use of lead tape. The resulting racquet exhibits a more head heavy balance point and a higher swingweight than the stock model with a higher overall weight, though this is similar to the model he endorses at approximately 12 oz. Modifications of this sort are common for professional players. Roddick uses a modified version of Babolat's Pure Drive Roddick GT. The cortex in particular is visibly painted onto the racquet. The signature racquet designed for him by Babolat is slightly heavier (11.9&nbsp;oz), stiffer (Babolat RDC index 72), and longer (27.5") than the standard Pure Drive Series (11.3 oz, Babolat RDC 71, 27"). The racquet is designed for a strong service due to its weight, stiffness, and length. According to Tennis Warehouse, it is the best one for this fundamental stroke. He strings with a custom hybrid (Pro Hurricane Tour + VS Touch(Natural Gut)). Roddick previously used Babolat RPM Blast and Babolat Revenge (used only for a short period of time) as his mains. Roddick's tensions varies, he used to string around 65&nbsp;lbs, but now he strings roughly at 55–57&nbsp;lbs depending on conditions and weather. Roddick also uses Babolat Propulse III tennis shoes, which are his signature gear.f_Propulse GB_SD edits.ppt Babolat.com  From 2000 to 2005, Roddick wore Reebok apparel. After Reebok announced it would not renew its contract with Roddick, Roddick signed a five-year, $25 million endorsement deal with Lacoste in April 2005. In November, he signed an agreement to endorse Lacoste eyewear for four years worth between $750,000 and $1 million. In June 2013, Roddick became an investor and brand ambassador to TravisMathew Apparel.http://www.travismathew.com/team/andy-roddick/#.VaCWRnie5FI Roddick, as well as fellow former American tennis players James Blake and Mardy Fish, wear TravisMathew's TM Red headwear, shirts and shorts during matches.

His other endorsement deals include American Express, Rolex, Powerade in 2002, Parlux Fragrances, Arizona Beverage Company in 2009, Microsoft Xbox and Sega.  Roddick's serve is known for its power, usually serving at around 130–150&nbsp;mph (209~242&nbsp;km/h), often resulting in nonreturnable serves . Roddick's favorite shot is his off-forehand which he uses in combination with his kicker out wide. In the past, Roddick used to play his off-forehand frequently but has since adjusted and used it to create points. He usually targets the two corners to win aces. As for his second serve, he usually employs a heavy kick serve, then tries to use a variety of spins, slices, and angles in the rally to throw off his opponent. He is noted to use heavy topspin on both his serves and his twist serve is particularly high kicking. Roddick will also occasionally use the serve-and-volley tactic on both first and second services to surprise his opponent, though he generally prefers to remain near the baseline after a serve. He has developed a more all-court playing style compared to the aggressive baseline style he played with for most of his early career. Although Roddick's backhand is still a weakness today, it is considered to have improved somewhat in 2009 under Stefanki's guidance. On April 5, 2002, Roddick guest-starred on the television show Sabrina the Teenage Witch as himself.

Roddick also appeared on a 2004 episode of the Anne Robinson version of The Weakest Link, but ended up being voted off. Roddick is in a This is SportsCenter ad with Stuart Scott, in which he confronts the Sports Center anchor about the anchors not calling him "A-Rod", and asks him "Did Alex Rodriguez put you up to this?" Scott replies "Who?" Roddick says "A-Rod!" Scott gets a sneaky look on his face, and Roddick leaves disgusted. The June/July issue of Men's Fitness magazine carried an article on Roddick. The cover shot featured the tennis ace in a T-shirt, straining to contain massive, pumped-up biceps and hulking shoulder and chest muscles. The image set off widespread online speculation that the magazine had altered Roddick's likeness, a suspicion echoed by Roddick himself. Roddick has quipped that he saw the photo, and that "Nadal wanted his arms back." In March 2009, Andy Roddick appeared in the "Speed Feels Better" music video for singer/songwriter Michael Tolcher. Other athletes in the video included Amanda Beard, Barry Sanders, Kimmie Meissner, and Rick Ankiel.
