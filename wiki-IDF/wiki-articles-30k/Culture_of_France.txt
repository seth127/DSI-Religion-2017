   The culture of France and of the French people has been shaped by geography, by profound historical events, and by foreign and internal forces and groups. France, and in particular Paris, has played an important role as a center of high culture since the 17th century, first in Europe, and from the 19th century on, worldwide. From the late 19th century, France has also played an important role in cinema, fashion and cuisine. The importance of French culture has waxed and waned over the centuries, depending on its economic, political and military importance. French culture today is marked both by great regional and socioeconomic differences and by strong unifying tendencies. The Académie française sets an official standard of language purity; however, this standard, which is not mandatory, is even occasionally ignored by the government itself: for instance, the left-wing government of Lionel Jospin pushed for the feminization of the names of some functions (madame la ministre) while the Académie pushed for some more traditional madame le ministre. Some action has been taken by the government in order to promote French culture and the French language. For instance, there exists a system of subsidies and preferential loans for supporting French cinema. The Toubon law, from the name of the conservative culture minister who promoted it, makes it mandatory to use French in advertisements directed to the general public. Note that contrary to some misconception sometimes found in the Anglophone media, the French government neither regulates the language used by private parties in non-commercial settings, nor makes it compulsory that France-based WWW sites should be in French. France counts many regional languages, some of them being very different from standard French such as Breton (a Celtic language close to Cornish and Welsh) and Alsatian (an Alemannic dialect of German). Some regional languages are Roman, like French, such as Occitan. The Basque language is completely unrelated to French and, indeed, to any other language in the world; its area straddles the border between the south west of France and the north of Spain. Many of those languages have enthusiastic advocates; however, the real importance of local languages remains subject to debate. In April 2001, the Minister of Education, Jack Lang, admitted formally that for more than two centuries, the political powers of the French government had repressed regional languages, and announced that bilingual education would, for the first time, be recognized, and bilingual teachers recruited in French public schools.  In French schools, pupils are expected to learn at least two foreign languages, the first of which is typically German or English. A revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles in July 2008.Article 75-1: (a new article): "Les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France" ("Regional languages belong to the patrimony of France"). See .   France is a secular country where freedom of thought and of religion is preserved, by virtue of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Republic is based on the principle of laïcité, that is of freedom of religion (including of agnosticism and atheism) enforced by the Jules Ferry laws and the 1905 law on the separation of the State and the Church, enacted at the beginning of the Third Republic (1871–1940). A January 2007 poll found that 61% of the French population describe themselves as Roman Catholics, 21% as Atheists, 4% as Muslims, 3% as Protestants, 1% as Buddhists, and 1% as Jews. In May 2015, in a poll published by Le Monde, 63% of the French population describes itself without religions. France guarantees freedom of religion as a constitutional right and the government generally respects this right in practice. A long history of violent conflict between groups led the state to break its ties to the Catholic Church early in the last century and adopt a strong commitment to maintaining a totally secular public sector. Franţa nu mai e o ţară catolică (France is no longer a Catholic country), Cotidianul, 2007-01-11; "France 'no longer a Catholic country'", Daily Telegraph,  10 January 2007  The Roman Catholic Church has always played a significant role in French culture and in French life. Most French people are Roman Catholic Christians, however many of them are secular but still place high value on Catholicism. The Roman Catholic faith is no longer considered the state religion, as it was before the 1789 Revolution and throughout the various, non-republican regimes of the 19th century (the Restoration, the July Monarchy and the Second Empire). The Official split of Catholic Church and State ("Séparation de l'Eglise et de l'Etat") took place in 1905, and this major reform emphazises the Laicist and anti-clericalist mood of French Radical Republicans in this period. At the beginning of the 20th century, France was a largely rural country with conservative Catholic mores, but in the hundred years since then, the countryside has become depopulated, and the population has largely become more secular. A December 2006 poll by Harris Interactive, published in The Financial Times, found that 32% of the French population described themselves as agnostic, a further 32% as atheist and only 27% believed in any type of God or supreme being.Religion Important for Americans, Italians, Angus Reid Global Monitor, December 16, 2008  France was touched by the Reforme during the XVIth century as 30% of the population. A consequent part of the princes turned themselves to the Reforme. The kingdom knows some troubles but it is especially from the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre on August the 24th of 1572 that the French Wars of Religion begun. It is one of the most important French civil war between Catholics, leaded by Henry I, Duke of Guise, and Protestants, leaded by Henri de Navarre. He becames finally king after his conversion to Catholicism in 1589. Despite his father's conviction, Louis XIII, Henri IV's son, started again Protestants' massacre especially representated by Siege of La Rochelle. Those exactions inhanced huguenots to leave their kingdom for others, called RefugeBirnsiel Eckart & Bernat Chrystel, La Diaspora des Huguenots : les réfugiés protestants de France et leur dispersion dans le monde (XVIe – XVIIIe), Paris, Edition Champion, 2005 like United-Provinces, England, South Africa or the New-World. This exil continued during all XVIIth century long and until 1787 and their civil rights restitutions by Louis XVI. Indeed, exactions had been really hard especially during Louis XIV reign : he revocated Edit de Nantes in 1685 which marks the end of Protestantism in France as a large phenomenon.   After Catholicism and atheism, Islam is the third largest faith in France today, and the country has the largest Muslim population (in percentage) of any Western European country. This is a result of immigration and permanent family settlement in France, from the 1960s on, of groups from, principally, North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya) and, to a lesser extent, other areas such as Turkey and West Africa.Kidd and Reynolds, 104-5.  While it is prohibited in France for the government census to collect data on religious beliefs, estimates and polls place the percentage of Muslims at between 4% and 7%.Kidd and Reynolds, for example, give a figure of 4 million Muslims, or 6.9%, based on sources dated 1993, 1994, 1999. (102). See Islam in France for more on recent estimates.  The current Jewish community in France numbers around 600,000, according to the World Jewish Congress and 500,000 according to the Appel Unifié Juif de France, and is found mainly in the metropolitan areas of Paris, Marseille and Strasbourg. The history of the Jews in France dates back over 2,000 years. In the early Middle Ages, France was a center of Jewish learning, but persecution increased as the Middle Ages wore on. France was the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution, but despite legal equality anti-Semitism remained an issue, as illustrated in the Dreyfus affair of the late 19th century. However, through the 1870 Décret Crémieux, France secured full citizenship for the Jews in then French-ruled Algeria. Despite the death of a quarter of all French Jews during the Holocaust, France currently has the largest Jewish population in Europe. French Jews are mostly Sephardic and span a range of religious affiliations, from the ultra-Orthodox Haredi communities to the large segment of Jews who are entirely secular.  Buddhism is widely reported to be the fifth largest religion in France, after Christianity, atheism, Islam, and Judaism. France has over two hundred Buddhist meditation centers, including about twenty sizable retreat centers in rural areas. The Buddhist population mainly consists of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants, with a substantial minority of native French converts and "sympathizers". The rising popularity of Buddhism in France has been the subject of considerable discussion in the French media and academy in recent years. France created in 2006 the first French parliamentary commission on cult activities which led to a report registering a number of cults considered as dangerous. Supporters of such movements have criticized the report on the grounds of the respect of religious freedom. Proponents of the measure contend that only dangerous cults have been listed as such, and state secularism ensures religious freedom in France. Modern France is the result of centuries of nation building and the acquisition and incorporation of a number of historical provinces and overseas colonies into its geographical and political structure. These regions all evolved with their own specific cultural and linguistic traditions in fashion, religious observance, regional language and accent, family structure, cuisine, leisure activities, industry, and including the simple way to pour wine,  etc. The evolution of the French state and culture, the Renaissance to today, has however promoted a centralization of politics, media and cultural production in and around Paris (and, to a lesser extent, around the other major urban centers), and the industrialization of the country in the 20th century has led to a massive move of French people from the countryside to urban areas. At the end of the 19th century, around 50% of the French depended on the land for a living; today French farmers only make up 6-7%, while 73% live in cities.Kidd and Reynolds, 30-31.  Nineteenth century French literature abounds in scenes of provincial youth "coming up" to Paris to "make it" in the cultural, political or social scene of the capital (this scheme is frequent in the novels of Balzac). Policies enacted by the French Third Republic also encouraged this displacement through mandatory military service, a centralized national educational system, and suppression of regional languages. While government policy and public debate in France in recent years has returned to a valorization of regional differences and a call for decentralization of certain aspects of the public sphere (sometimes with ethnic, racial or reactionary overtones), the history of regional displacement and the nature of the modern urban environment and of mass media and culture have made the preservation of a regional "sense of place or culture" in today's France extremely difficult. The names of the historical French provinces &mdash; such as Brittany (Bretagne), Berry, Orléanais, Normandy (Normandie), Languedoc, Lyonnais, Dauphiné, Champagne, Poitou, Guyenne and Gascony (Gascogne), Burgundy (Bourgogne), Picardy (Picardie), Provence, Touraine, Limousin,  Auvergne, Béarn, Alsace, Flanders, Lorraine, Corsica (Corse), Savoy (Savoie)... (please see individual articles for specifics about each regional culture) &mdash; are still used to designate natural, historical and cultural regions, and many of them appear in modern région or département names.  These names are also used by the French in their self-identification of family origin. Regional identification is most pronounced today in cultures linked to regional languages and non-French-speaking traditions - French language itself being only a dialect of Langue d'oïl, the mother language of many of the languages to-be-mentioned, which became a national vehicular language, like (in alphabetical order): Alsatian, Arpitan, Basque, Brezhoneg (Breton), Burgundian, Corsu (Corsican), Català (Catalan), Francique, Gallo, Lorrain, Norman, Occitan, Picard, Poitevin, Saintongeais,etc., and some of these regions have promoted movements calling for some degree of regional autonomy, and, occasionally, national independence (see, for example, Breton nationalism, Corsica and Occitania). There are huge differences in life style, socioeconomic status and world view between Paris and the provinces.  The French often use the expression "la France profonde" ("Deep France", similar to "heartland") to designate the profoundly "French" aspects of provincial towns, village life and rural agricultural culture, which escape the hegemony of Paris.  The expression can however have a pejorative meaning, similar to the expression "le désert français" ("the French desert") used to describe a lack of acculturation of the provinces.  Another expression, "terroir" is a French term originally used for wine and coffee to denote the special characteristics that geography bestowed upon these products. It can be very loosely translated as "a sense of place" which is embodied in certain qualities, and the sum of the effects that the local environment (especially the "soil") has had on the growth of the product.  The use of the term has since been generalized to talk about many cultural products. In addition to its metropolitan territory, France also consists of overseas departments made up of its former colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana in the Caribbean, and Mayotte and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.  (There also exist a number of "overseas collectivities" and "overseas territories".  For a full discussion, see administrative divisions of France.  Since 1982, following the French government’s policy of decentralisation, overseas departments have elected regional councils with powers similar to those of the regions of metropolitan France. As a result of a constitutional revision which occurred in 2003, these regions are now to be called overseas regions.)  These overseas departments have the same political status as metropolitan departments and are integral parts of France, (similar to the way in which Hawaii is a state and an integral part of the United States), yet they also have specific cultural and linguistic traditions which set them apart.  Certain elements of overseas culture have also been introduced to metropolitan culture (as, for example, the musical form the biguine). Industrialization, immigration and urbanization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have also created new socioeconomic regional communities in France, both urban (like Paris, Lyon, Villeurbanne, Lille, Marseille, etc.) and the suburban and working class hinterlands (like Seine-Saint-Denis) of urban agglomerations (called variously banlieues ("suburbs", sometimes qualified as "chic" or "pauvres" or les cités "housing projects") which have developed their own "sense of place" and local culture (much like the various boroughs of New York City or suburbs of Los Angeles), as well as cultural identity. Paris has traditionally been associated with alternative, artistic or intellectual subcultures, many of which involved foreigners. Such subcultures include the "Bohemians" of the mid-nineteenth century, the Impressionists, artistic circles of the Belle époque (around such artists as Picasso and Alfred Jarry), the Dadaists, Surrealists, the "Lost Generation" (Hemingway, Gertrude Stein) and the post-war "intellectuals" associated with Montparnasse (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir). France has an estimated 280,000-340,000 Roma, generally known as Gitans, Tsiganes, Romanichels (slightly pejorative), Bohémiens, or Gens du voyage ("travellers"). There are gay and lesbian communities in the cities, particularly in the Paris metropolitan area (such as in Le Marais district of the capital). Although homosexuality is perhaps not as well tolerated in France as in Spain, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations, surveys of the French public reveal a considerable shift in attitudes comparable to other Western European nations. As of 2001, 55% of the French consider homosexuality "an acceptable lifestyle."Embassy of France in the US - The PACS - A civil solidarity pact The past mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, is gay. In 2006, an Ipsos survey shows that 62% support same-sex marriage, while 37% were opposed. 55% believed gay and lesbian couples should not have parenting rights, while 44% believe same-sex couples should be able to adopt.Gay News From 365Gay.com See also LGBT rights in France. Growing out of the values of the Catholic Church and rural communities, the basic unit of French society was traditionally held to be the family.Kelley, "Family", 100. Over the twentieth century, the "traditional" family structure in France has evolved from various regional models (including extended families and nuclear familiesEmmanuel Todd, Hervé Le Bras, L’invention de la France : atlas anthropologiue et politique, chapter "Les grandes familles") to, after World War II, nuclear families.  Since the 1960s, marriages have decreased and divorces have increased in France, and divorce law and legal family status have evolved to reflect these social changes.Ibid. According to INSEE figures, household and family composition in metropolitan France continues to evolve.  Most significantly, from 1982 to 1999, single parent families have increased from 3.6% to 7.4%; there have also been increases in the number of unmarried couples, childless couples, and single men (from 8.5% to 12.5) and women (from 16.0% to 18.5%). Their analysis indicates that "one in three dwellings are occupied by a person living alone; one in four dwellings are occupied by a childless couple.." http://www.insee.fr/en/ffc/chifcle_fiche.asp?ref_id=NATTEF02313&tab_id=31 Voted by the French Parliament in November 1999 following some controversy, the pacte civil de solidarité ("civil pact of solidarity") commonly known as a PACS, is a form of civil union between two adults (same-sex or opposite-sex) for organizing their joint life.  It brings rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage.  From a legal standpoint, a PACS is a "contract" drawn up between the two individuals, which is stamped and registered by the clerk of the court.  Individuals who have registered a PACS are still considered "single" with regard to family status for some purposes, while they are increasingly considered in the same way as married couples are for other purposes.  While it was pushed by the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in 1998, it was also opposed, mostly by people on the right-wing who support traditionalist family values and who argued that PACS and the recognition of homosexual unions would be disastrous for French society. As of 2013, same-sex marriage is legally recognized in France. Same-sex marriage was an important factor in the presidential election of 2012 between François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy, who represents the right-wing UMP party, opposed gay marriage, while François Hollande, of the left wing socialist party, supported it. Hollande was elected in May 2012 and his government proposed the law known as "Mariage pour tous" ("marriage for all") to the parliament in November 2012. The law was passed in April 2013 and validated by the Conseil constitutionnel (the constitutional council, tasked with insuring that the new laws passed do not contradict the French constitution) in May 2013. The first French same-sex marriage took place on May 29, 2013 in Montpellier. The French state has traditionally played an important role in promoting and supporting culture through the educational, linguistic, cultural and economic policies of the government and through its promotion of national identity.  Because of the closeness of this relationship, cultural changes in France are often linked to, or produce, political crisis.Kelley, 246-7. The relationship between the French state and culture is an old one. Under Louis XIII's minister Richelieu, the independent Académie française came under state supervision and became an official organ of control over the French language and seventeenth-century literature. During  Louis XIV's reign, his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert brought French luxury industries, like textile and porcelain, under royal control and the architecture, furniture, fashion and etiquette of the royal court (particularly at the Château de Versailles)  became the preeminent model of noble culture in France (and, to a great degree, throughout Europe) during the latter half of the seventeenth century. At times, French state policies have sought to unify the country around certain cultural norms, while at other times they have promoted regional differences within a heterogeneous French identity.  The unifying effect was particularly true of the "radical period"" of the French Third Republic which fought regionalisms (including regional languages), supported anti-clericalism and a strict separation of church from state (including education) and actively promoted national identity, thus converting (as the historian Eugen Weber has put it) a "country of peasants into a nation of Frenchmen".  The Vichy Regime, on the other hand, promoted regional "folk" traditions. The cultural policies of the (current) French Fifth Republic have been varied, but a consensus seems to exist around the need for preservation of French regionalisms (such as food and language) as long as these don't undermine national identity.  Meanwhile, the French state remains ambivalent over the integration into "French" culture of cultural traditions from recent immigrant groups and from foreign cultures, particularly American culture (movies, music, fashion, fast food, language, etc.).  There also exists a certain fear over the perceived loss of French identity and culture in the European system and under American "cultural hegemony". The French educational system is highly centralized. It is divided into three different stages: primary education, or enseignement primaire, corresponding to grade school in the United States; secondary education, or collège and lycée, corresponding to middle and high school in the United States; and higher education (l'université or ''les [[Grandes écoles]]'').  Primary and secondary education is predominantly public (private schools also exist, in particular a strong nationwide network of primary and secondary [[Catholic education]]), while higher education has both public and private elements. At the end of secondary education, students take the  [[baccalauréat]] exam, which allows them to pursue higher education. The baccalauréat pass rate in 2012 was 84.5%.  In 1999–2000, educational spending amounted to 7% of the French GDP and 37% of the national budget.  France's performance in math and science at the middle school level was ranked 23 in the 1995 [[TIMSS|Trends in International Math and Science Study]].<ref>TIMSS 1995 Highlights of Results for the Middle School Years [http://timss.bc.edu/timss1995i/HiLightB.html].  France has not participated in later TIMSS studies. [http://nces.ed.gov/timss/countries.asp]</ref>  Since the [[Jules Ferry laws]] of 1881-2, named after the then Minister of Public Instruction, all state-funded schools, including universities, are independent from the (Roman Catholic) Church. Education in these institutions is free. Non-secular institutions are allowed to organize education as well.  The French educational system differs strongly from Northern-European and American systems in that it stresses the importance of partaking in a society as opposed to being responsibly independent.  Secular educational policy has become critical in recent issues of French multiculturalism, as in the "[[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|affair of the Islamic headscarf]]".  ===Minister of Culture=== {{Main|Minister of Culture (France)}} The Minister of Culture is in the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]], the [[French government ministers|cabinet member]] in charge of national museums and monuments;<ref>{{Cite book|title = Minister of Culture|last = Jesse Russell, Ronald Cohn|first = |publisher = Tbilisi State University|year = 2012|ISBN= 551096314X|location = |pages = 154}}</ref> promoting and protecting the arts (visual, plastic, theatrical, musical, dance, architectural, literary, televisual and cinematographic) in France and abroad; and managing the national archives and regional "maisons de culture" (culture centres). The Ministry of Culture is located on the [[Palais Royal]] in [[Paris]].  The modern post of Minister of Culture was created by [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1959 and the first Minister was the writer [[André Malraux]].  Malraux was responsible for realizing the goals of the "droit à la culture" ("the right to culture") -- an idea which had been incorporated in the [[French constitution]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) -- by democratizing access to culture, while also achieving the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] aim of elevating the "grandeur" ("greatness") of post-war France.  To this end, he created numerous regional cultural centres throughout France and actively sponsored the arts.  Malraux's artistic tastes included the modern arts and the avant-garde, but on the whole he remained conservative.  The Ministry of [[Jacques Toubon]] was notable for a number of laws (the "[[Toubon Law]]s") enacted for the preservation of the [[French language]], both in advertisements (all ads must include a French translation of foreign words) and on the radio (40% of songs on French radio stations must be in French), ostensibly in reaction to the presence of English.  ===Académie française=== {{Main|Académie française}} The ''Académie française'', or the French Academy, is the pre-eminent French learned body on matters pertaining to the [[French language]]. The Académie was officially established in 1635 by [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the chief minister to [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]]. Suppressed in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], it was restored in 1803 by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (the Académie considers itself having been suspended, not suppressed, during the revolution). It is the oldest of the five ''académies'' of the [[Institut de France]].  The Académie consists of forty members, known as ''immortels'' (immortals). New members are elected by the members of the Académie itself. Académicians hold office for life, but they may be removed for misconduct. The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language; it is charged with publishing an official dictionary of the language. Its rulings, however, are only advisory; not binding on either the public or the government.  ===Military service=== Until 1996, France had compulsory [[military service]] of young men. This has been credited by historians for further promoting a unified national identity and by breaking down regional isolationism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  ===Labor and employment policy=== In France, the first labour laws were [[Waldeck Rousseau]]'s laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid [[Annual leave|vacation]] for workers, and a [[Matignon Accords (1936)|law]] limiting the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The [[:fr:Accords de Grenelle|Grenelle accords]] negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise.<ref>[[:fr:section syndicale d'entreprise|fr:section syndicale d'entreprise]]'' December 27, 1968 law</ref> The minimum wage was also increased by 25%.<ref>[[:fr:Salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti|fr:SMIG]]</ref> In 2000 [[Lionel Jospin]]'s government then enacted the [[35-hour workweek]], down from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] enacted the [[New Employment Contract]] (CNE). Addressing the demands of employers asking for more flexibility in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it was lending favour to [[contingent work]]. In 2006 he then attempted to pass the [[First Employment Contract]] (CPE) through a vote by emergency procedure, but that it was met by [[2006 labor protests in France|students and unions' protests]]. President [[Jacques Chirac]] finally had no choice but to repeal it.  ===Healthcare and social welfare=== The French are profoundly committed to the public healthcare system (called "sécurité sociale") and to their "pay-as-you-go" social welfare system.  In 1998, 75% of health payments in France were paid through the public healthcare system. Since 27 July 1999, France has a universal medical coverage for permanent residents in France (stable residence for more than three months). Using five performance indicators to measure health systems in 191 member states, it finds that France provides the best overall health care followed among major countries by Italy, Spain, Oman, Austria and Japan (The World Health Report).  ==Lifestyle==  ===Food and alcohol=== {{Main|French cuisine}} Traditional French culture places a high priority on the enjoyment of food. French cuisine was codified in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier|Georges Auguste Escoffier]] to become the modern version of ''[[haute cuisine]]''. Escoffier's major work, however, left out much of the regional character to be found in the provinces of France. Gastro-tourism and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to bring people to the countryside during the 20th century and beyond, to sample this rich ''[[bourgeois]]'' and [[peasant]] cuisine of France. [[Basque cuisine]] has also been a great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France.  Ingredients and dishes vary by region (see: [[French cuisine#Regional cuisine|Regional cuisine]]). There are many significant regional dishes that have become both national and regional. Many dishes that were once regional, however, have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. [[Cheese]] (see: [[List of French cheeses]]) and [[wine]] (see: [[French wine]]) are also a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws, ([[lentils]] from [[Le Puy-en-Velay]] also have an AOC status). Another French product of special note is the [[Charolais cattle]].  [[Image:Crêpe opened up.jpg|thumb|250px|A sweet [[crêpe]]. Crêpes are originally from [[Brittany]].]] The French typically eat only a simple breakfast ("petit déjeuner") which consists of [[coffee]], [[tea]] or [[hot chocolate]] with milk, served traditionally in a large handleless "bol" (bowl) and [[bread]] or breakfast pastries ([[croissants]]). Lunch ("déjeuner") and dinner ("dîner") are the main meals of the day. Formal four course meals consist of a starter course ("entrée"), a [[salad]], a main course ("plat principal"), and finally a cheese or dessert course. While French cuisine is often associated with rich desserts, in most homes dessert consists of only [[fruit]] or [[yogurt]].  Food shopping in France was formerly done almost daily in small local shops and markets, but the arrival of the [[supermarket]] and the even larger ''"hypermarchés"'' (large-surface distributors) in France have disrupted this tradition. With depopulation of the countryside, many towns have been forced to close shops and markets.  Rates of [[obesity]] and [[heart disease]] in France have traditionally been lower than in other north-western European countries. This is sometimes called the [[French paradox]] (see, for example, [[Mireille Guiliano]]'s 2006 book ''French Women Don't Get Fat''). French cuisine and eating habits have however come under great pressure in recent years from modern [[fast food]], American products and the new global agricultural industry. While French youth culture has gravitated toward fast food and American eating habits (with an attendant rise in obesity), the French in general have remained committed to preserving certain elements of their food culture through such activities as including programs of taste acquisition in their public schools, by the use of the [[appellation d'origine contrôlée]] laws, and by state and European subsides to the French agricultural industry. Emblematic of these tensions is the work of [[José Bové]], who founded in 1987, the ''Confédération Paysanne'', an agricultural union that places its highest political values on humans and the environment, promotes [[organic farming]] and opposes genetically modified organisms; Bové's most famous protest was the dismantling of a [[McDonald's]] franchise in [[Millau]] ([[Aveyron]]), in 1999.  In France, [[cutlery]] is used in the continental manner (with the fork in the left hand, prongs facing down and the knife in the right hand). French etiquette prohibits the placing of hands below the table and the placing of elbows on it.  The legal drinking age is officially 18 (see: [[Legal drinking age]]).  France is one of the oldest [[wine]] producing regions of [[Europe]]. France now produces the most wine by value in the world (although [[Italy]] rivals it by volume and [[Spain]] has more land under cultivation for wine grapes). [[Bordeaux wine]], [[Bourgogne wine]] and [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] are important agricultural products.  ===Tobacco and drugs=== The [[cigarette]] smoking age is 18 years. According to a widespread cliché, smoking has been part of French culture &mdash; actually [[List of countries by cigarette consumption per capita|figures]] indicate that in terms of consumption per capita, France is only the 60th country out of 121.  France, from 1 February 2007, tightened the existing ban on smoking in public places found in the 1991 Évin law: [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/ADEAN.htm Law n°91-32 of 10 January, 1991], containing a variety of measures against [[alcoholism]] and tobacco consumption.  Smoking is now banned in all public places (stations, museums, etc.); an exception exists for special smoking rooms fulfilling drastic conditions, see below. A special exemption was made for cafés and restaurants, clubs, casinos, bars, etc. which ended, 1 January 2008.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/SQHYN.htm Decree n°2006-1386 over 15th November, 2006] taken as application of [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&code=CSANPUNL.rcv&art=L3511-7 article L3511-7] of the Public Health Code, banning smoking in public places.</ref> Opinion polls suggest 70% of people support the ban.<ref>{{cite news | title=France to ban smoking in public | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6032125.stm | accessdate=2006-10-09  | work=BBC News | date=2006-10-08}}</ref> Previously, under the former implementation rules of the 1991 Évin law, restaurants, cafés etc. just had to provide smoking and non-smoking sections, which in practice were often not well separated.  Under the new regulations, smoking rooms are allowed, but are subjected to very strict conditions: they may occupy at most 20% of the total floor space of the establishment and their size may not be more than 35 m²; they need to be equipped with separate ventilation which replaces the full volume of air ten times per hour; the air pressure of the smoking room must constantly be lower than the pressure in the contiguous rooms; they have doors that close automatically; no service can be provided in the smoking rooms; cleaning and maintenance personnel may enter the room only one hour after it was last used for smoking.  Popular French cigarette brands include [[Gauloises]] and [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]].  The possession, sale and use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (predominantly [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[hashish]]) is illegal in France.  Since 1 March 1994, the penalties for cannabis use are from two months to a year and/or a fine, while possession, cultivation or trafficking of the drug can be punished much more severely, up to ten years. According to a 1992 survey by SOFRES, 4.7 million French people ages 12–44 have smoked cannabis at least once in their lives.<ref>http://www.cedro-uva.org/lib/boekhout.france.html</ref>  ===Sports and hobbies=== {{Main|Sport in France}}  [[Football in France|Football]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Le Foot'') is the most popular sport in France. Other popular sports played in France are [[rugby union]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[team handball|handball]], [[basketball]] and [[sailing]]. France is notable for holding and winning the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] in 1998, and holding the annual cycling race [[Tour de France]], and the tennis Grand Slam tournament the [[French Open]]. Sport is encouraged in school, and local sports clubs receive financial support from the local governments. While football is definitely the most popular, [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] takes dominance in the southwest, especially around the city of [[Toulouse]] (see: [[Rugby union in France]] and [[Rugby league in France]]).  The modern [[Olympics]] was invented in France, in 1894 by [[Pierre de Coubertin]].  Professional sailing in France is centred on singlehanded and shorthanded ocean racing with the pinnacle of this branch of the sport being the [[Vendée Globe]] singlehanded around the world race which starts every 4 years from the French Atlantic coast. Other significant events include the Solitaire du Figaro, [[Mini Transat 6.50]], Tour de France a Voile and Route du Rhum transatlantic race. France has been a regular competitor in the [[America's Cup]] since the 1970s.  Other important sports include:  * [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] - The world's oldest sports car race. * [[Skiing]] - France has an extensive number of ski resorts in the French alps such as [[Tignes]]. Ski resorts are also located in the Pyrénées and Vosges mountain chains. * [[Pétanque]] - The international federation is recognized by the [[IOC]]. * [[Fencing]] - Fencing leads the list of sports for which gold medals were won for France at the [[Summer Olympics]] (see: [[France at the Olympics]]). * [[Parkour]] - Developed in France, Parkour is a training discipline with similarities to [[self-defense]] or [[martial arts]]. * [[Babyfoot]] ([[table football]]) - A very popular pastime in bars and homes in France, and the French are the predominant winners of worldwide table football competitions. * [[Kitesurfing]]  Like other cultural areas in France, sport is overseen by a government ministry, the [[Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (France)]] which is in charge of national and public sport associations, youth affairs, public sports centers and national stadia (like the [[Stade de France]]).  ===Fashion=== {{Main|French fashion}} Along with Milan, London and New York, Paris is center of an important number of fashion shows. Some of the world's biggest fashion houses (ex: [[Chanel]]) have their headquarters in France.  The association of France with [[fashion]] ({{lang|fr|''la mode''}}) dates largely to the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] <ref>Kelly, 101.  DeJean, chapters 2-4.</ref> when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe.  France renewed its dominance of the high fashion ({{lang|fr|''couture'' or ''haute couture''}}) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great [[couturier]] houses, the fashion press (''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' was founded in 1892; ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' was founded in 1945) and [[fashion shows]].  The first modern Parisian couturier house is generally considered the work of the Englishman [[Charles Frederick Worth]] who dominated the industry from 1858 to 1895.<ref>Kelly, 101.</ref>  In the early twentieth century, the industry expanded through such Parisian fashion houses as the house of [[Chanel]] (which first came to prominence in 1925) and [[Balenciaga]] (founded by a Spaniard in 1937).  In the post war year, fashion returned to prominence through [[Christian Dior]]'s famous "new look" in 1947, and through the houses of [[Pierre Balmain]] and [[Hubert de Givenchy]] (opened in 1952).  In the 1960s, "high fashion" came under criticism from France's youth culture while designers like [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] broke with established high fashion norms by launching ''[[prêt-à-porter]]'' ("ready to wear") lines and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing and marketing.<ref>Dauncey, 195.</ref>  Further innovations were carried out by [[Paco Rabanne]] and [[Pierre Cardin]]. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established in the 70s and 80s by [[Sonia Rykiel]], [[Thierry Mugler]], [[Claude Montana]], [[Jean Paul Gaultier]] and [[Christian Lacroix]].  The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as [[LVMH]].  Since the 1960s, France's fashion industry has come under increasing competition from London, New York, Milan and Tokyo, and the French have increasingly adopted foreign (particularly American) fashions (such as jeans, tennis shoes).  Nevertheless, many foreign designers still seek to make their careers in France.  ===Pets=== {{Expand section|date=February 2012}} In 2006, 52% of French households had at least one [[pet]]:<ref>''Le marché des aliments pour chiens et chats en Belgique''. Mission Economique de Bruxelles, 2006. [http://www.ubifrance.fr/download/download.asp?cleautonomy=3204091 Read this document (in French) PDF]</ref>  In total, 9.7 million [[cat]]s, 8.8 million [[dog]]s, 2.3 million [[rodent]]s, 8 million [[bird]]s, and 28 million [[fish]] were kept as pets in France during this year.  ==Media and art==  ===Art and museums=== {{Main|French art}} The first paintings of France are those that are from prehistoric times, painted in the caves of [[Lascaux]] well over 10,000 years ago. The arts were already flourishing 1,200 years ago, at the time of [[Charlemagne]], as can be seen in many hand made and hand illustrated books of that time.  [[Gothic art]] and architecture originated in France in the 12th century around Paris and then spread to all of Europe. In the 13th century, French craftsmen developed the stained glass painting technique and sophisticated illuminated manuscripts for private devotion in the new gothic style. The final phase of gothic architecture, known as Flamboyant, also began in France in the 15th century before spreading to the rest of Europe.  The 17th century was one of intense artistic achievements : French painting emerged with a distinct identity, moving from Baroque to Classicism. Famous classic painters of the 17th century in France are [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]]. French architecture also proved influential with the Palace of Versailles, built for the powerful king Louis XIV, becoming the model of many European royal palaces. During the 18th century the [[Rococo]] style emerged as a frivolous continuation of the [[Baroque]] style. The most famous painters of the era were [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]. At the end of the century, [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Dominique Ingres]] were the most influential painters of the [[Neoclassicism]].  [[Théodore Géricault|Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] were the most important painters of the [[Romanticism]]. Afterwards, the painters were more realistic, describing nature ([[Barbizon school]]). The [[Realism (arts)|realistic movement]] was led by [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Honoré Daumier]]. Impressionism was developed in France by artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Camille Pissarro]]. At the turn of the century, France had become more than ever the center of innovative art. The Spaniard [[Pablo Picasso]] came to France, like many other foreign artists, to deploy his talents there for decades to come. [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Gauguin]] and [[Cézanne]] were painting then. [[Cubism]] is an [[avant-garde]] movement born in Paris at the beginning of the 20th century.  The [[Louvre]] in Paris is one of the most famous and the largest art museums in the world, created by the new revolutionary regime in 1793 in the former royal palace. It holds a vast amount of art of French and other artists, e.g. the [[Mona Lisa]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and classical Greek [[Venus de Milo]] and ancient works of culture and art from Egypt and the Middle East.  ===Music=== {{Main|Music of France}} France boasts a wide variety of indigenous [[folk music]], as well as styles played by immigrants from Africa, Latin America and Asia.  In the field of [[classical music]], France has produced a number of notable composers such as [[Gabriel Fauré]], [[Claude Debussy]], and [[Hector Berlioz]] while modern pop music has seen the rise of popular [[French hip hop]], [[French rock]], [[techno]]/[[funk]], and [[turntablist]]s/djs.  The [[Fête de la Musique]] was created in France (first held in 1982), a music festival, which has since become worldwide {{clarify|Does this mean it is merely known worldwide or is it now sometimes taking place in other countries?|date=February 2011}}. It takes place every June 21, on the first day of summer.  In 2010, the French electronic music duo, Daft Punk was admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight).  ===Theater=== {{Main|Theater of France}}  ===Cinema=== {{Main|Cinema of France|French comedy films}} France is [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|the birthplace of cinema]] and was responsible for many of its early significant contributions:<ref name="NYT 1995-02-28">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/28/movies/the-birthplace-celebrates-film-s-big-1-0-0.html |title=The Birthplace Celebrates Film's Big 1-0-0 |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |date=February 28, 1995 |author=Alan Riding}}</ref> [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Antoine Lumière]] realized, on 28 December 1895, the first projection, with the [[Cinematograph]], in Paris.<ref>[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ December 28, 1895.]</ref> Philippe Binant realized, on 2 February 2000, the first [[digital cinema]] projection in [[Europe]], with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]], in Paris.<ref>''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', n°hors-série, Paris, April 2000, p. 32 (''cf.'' also [http://academiecine.tv/files/8113/7674/5261/Histoire_communications.pdf ''Histoire des communications'', 2011, p. 10.]).</ref> Several important cinematic movements, including the [[Nouvelle Vague]], began in the country.  Additionally, France is an important [[Francophone]] film production country. A certain amount of the movies created share international distribution in the western hemisphere thanks to [[Unifrance]]. Although French cinema industry is rather small in terms of budget and revenues, it enjoys qualitative screenplay, cast and story telling. French Cinema is often portrayed as more liberal in terms of subjects (Sex, Society, Politics, Historical). {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Within the domestic market, French movies are ranked through n° of entries. Movies are premiered on Wednesdays.  "Going to the movies" is a popular activity within metropolitan areas. Many cinema operators offer a "flat-rate pass" for approx. €20 per month. Prices per movie range between €5.50 and €10.  French major cinema operators are [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] and [[Pathé]], mainly located in city suburbs due to the number of screens and seating capacity.  Within France many "small" cinemas are located in the downtown parts of a city, resisting the big cinema operators nationwide. [[Paris]] has the highest density of cinemas (movie theaters) in the world:<ref>20 questions about studying in France |url=http://old.campusfrance.org/en/a-etudier/faq.htm</ref> biggest number of movie theaters per inhabitants, and that in most "downtown Paris" movie theaters, foreign movies which would be secluded to "art houses" cinemas in other places, are shown alongside "mainstream" works as Parisians are avid movie-goers. Proximity of restaurants, accessibility, ambiance and the showing of alternative foreign movies is often cited as being the advantage of these small theaters.  The [[Cinémathèque Française]] holds one of the largest archives of films, movie documents and film-related objects in the world. Located in Paris, the Cinémathèque holds daily screenings of films unrestricted by country of origin.  ===Television=== {{Main|Television in France}}  ===Books, newspapers and magazines=== {{Main|French media|French literature}} France has the reputation of being a "literary culture",<ref>Theodore Zedlin, quoted in Kidd and Reynolds, 266</ref> and this image is reinforced by such things as the importance of [[French literature]] in the French educational system, the attention paid by the French media to French [[book fair]]s and book prizes (like the [[Prix Goncourt]], [[Prix Renaudot]] or [[Prix Femina]]) and by the popular success of the (former) literary television show "[[Apostrophes (talk show)|Apostrophes]]" (hosted by [[Bernard Pivot]]).  Although the [[list of countries by literacy rate|official literacy rate]] of France is 99%, some estimates have placed [[functional illiteracy]] at between 10% and 20% of the adult population (and higher in the prison population).<ref name="Kidd and Reynolds, 261">Kidd and Reynolds, 261.</ref>  While reading remains a favorite pastime of French youth today, surveys show that it has decreased in importance compared to music, television, sports and other activities.<ref name="Kidd and Reynolds, 261"/>  The crisis of [[academic publishing]] has also hit France (see, for example, the financial difficulties of the [[Presses universitaires de France]] (PUF), France's premier academic publishing house, in the 1990s).<ref>Kidd and Reynolds, 266.</ref>  Literary taste in France remains centered on the novel (26.4% of book sales in 1997), although the French read more non-fiction essays and books on current affairs than the British or Americans.<ref>Kidd and Reynolds, 258 and 264.</ref>  Contemporary novels, including French translations of foreign novels, lead the list (13% of total books sold), followed by sentimental novels (4.1%), detective and spy fiction  (3.7%), "classic" literature (3.5%), science fiction and horror (1.3%) and erotic fiction (0.2%).<ref>Kidd and Reynolds, 265.</ref>  About 30% of all fiction sold in France today is translated from English (authors such as [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], [[John le Carré]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Paul Auster]] and [[Douglas Kennedy (writer)|Douglas Kennedy]] are well received).<ref name="time.com">Donald Morrison, "The Death of French Culture", ''Time'', Wednesday Nov. 21, 2007. {http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1686532,00.html}</ref>  An important subset of book sales is [[comic book]]s (typically [[Franco-Belgian comics]] like ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Astérix]]'') which are published in a large hardback format; comic books represented 4% of total book sales in 1997.<ref>Kidd and Reynolds, 264.</ref>  French artists have made the country a leader in the [[graphic novel]] genre<ref name="time.com"/> and France hosts the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]], Europe's preeminent comics festival.  Like other areas of French culture, book culture is influenced, in part, by the state, in particular by the "Direction du livre et de la lecture" of the Ministry of Culture, which oversees the "Centre national du livre" (National Book Center).  The French Ministry of Industry also plays a role in price control.  Finally, the [[Value added tax|VAT]] for books and other cultural products in France is at the reduced rate of 5.5%, which is also that of food and other necessities ([[:fr:Taxe sur la valeur ajoutée|see here]]).  In terms of journalism in France, the regional press (see [[list of newspapers in France]]) has become more important than national dailies (such as [[Le Monde]] and [[Le Figaro]]) over the past century: in 1939, national dailies were 2/3 of the dailies market, while today they are less than 1/4.<ref>Kidd and Reynolds, 232.</ref>  The magazine market is currently dominated by TV listings magazines<ref>Kidd and Reynolds, 236</ref> followed by [[news magazine]]s such as [[Le Nouvel Observateur]], [[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] and [[Le Point]].  ==Architecture and housing== {{Main|French architecture}}  ==Transportation== {{Main|Transport in France}}  There are significant differences in lifestyles with respect to transportation between very urbanized regions such as Paris, and smaller towns and rural areas. In Paris, and to a lesser extent in other major cities, many households do not own an automobile and simply use efficient [[public transport]]. The cliché about the Parisien is [[rush hour]] in the ''[[Paris Métro|Métro]]'' subway. However, outside of such areas, ownership of one or more cars is standard, especially for households with children.  The [[TGV]] high-speed rail network, ''train à grande vitesse'' is a fast rail transport which serves several areas of the country and is self-financing. There are plans to reach most parts of France and many other destinations in Europe in coming years. Rail services to major destinations are punctual and frequent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}  ==Holidays== {{Main|Public holidays in France}} Despite the principles of ''laïcité'' and the separation of church from state, public and school holidays in France generally follow the Roman Catholic religious calendar (including [[Easter]], [[Christmas]], [[Ascension Day]], [[Pentecost]], [[Assumption of Mary]], [[All Saints Day]], etc.). [[Labor Day]] and the National Holiday are the only business holidays determined by government statute; the other holidays are granted by ''convention collective'' (agreement between employers' and employees' unions) or by agreement of the employer.  The five holiday periods of the public school year<ref>French schoolyear calendar {fr}[http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid184/le-calendrier-scolaire.html]</ref> are: * the ''vacances de la Toussaint'' ([[All Saints Day]]) - two weeks starting near the end of October. * the ''vacances de Noël'' ([[Christmas]]) - two weeks, ending after [[New Years]]. * the ''vacances d'hiver'' ([[winter]]) - two weeks in February and March. * the ''vacances de printemps'' ([[Spring (season)|spring]]), formerly ''vacances de Pâques'' ([[Easter]]) - two weeks in April and May. * the ''vacances d'été'' ([[summer]]), or ''grandes vacances'' (literally: big holidays) - two months in July and August.  On May 1, [[Labour Day]] (''La Fête du Travail'') the French give flowers of [[Lily of the Valley]] (Le Muguet) to one another.  The National holiday (called [[Bastille Day]] in English) is on the 14 of July.  Military parades, called [[Bastille Day Military Parade|Défilés du 14 juillet]], are held, the largest on the [[Champs-Élysées]] avenue in [[Paris]] in front of the [[President of France|President of the Republic]].  On November 2, [[All Souls Day]] (''La Fête des morts''), the French traditionally bring [[chrysanthemum]]s to the tombs of departed family members.  On November 11, [[Remembrance Day]] (''Le Jour de la Commémoration'' or ''L' Armistice'') is an official holiday.  [[Christmas]] is generally celebrated in France on Christmas Eve by a traditional meal (typical dishes include [[oyster]]s, [[boudin blanc]] and the [[bûche de Noël]]), by opening presents and by attending the [[midnight mass]] (even among Catholics who do not attend church at other times of the year).  [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Candlemas]] (''La Chandeleur'') is celebrated with [[crêpe]]s. The popular saying is that if the cook can flip a crêpe singlehandedly with a coin in the other hand, the family is assured of prosperity throughout the coming year.  The Anglo-Saxon and American holiday [[Halloween]] has grown in popularity following its introduction in the mid-1990s by the trade associations.  The growth seems to have stalled during the following decade.  ==Conventions== * France is the home of the [[International System of Units]] (the metric system).<ref>[http://www.nist.gov/physlab/div842/fcdc/si-units.cfm International System of Units (SI)] - Physics Laboratory</ref> Some pre-metric units are still used, essentially the ''[[Pound (mass)#French livre|livre]]'' (a unit of weight equal to half a kilogram) and the ''[[quintal]]'' (a unit of weight equal to 100 kilograms). * In [[mathematics]], France uses the [[infix notation]] like most countries. For large numbers the [[long and short scales|long scale]] is used. Thus, the French use the word ''[[billion (word)|billion]]'' for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using [[Long and short scales|short scale]] is called a [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]. However, there exists a French word, ''milliard'', for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite the use of the long scale, one billion is called ''un milliard'' ("one milliard") in French, and not ''mille millions'' ("one thousand million"). It should also be noted that names of numbers above the ''milliard'' are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called ''mille milliards'' ("one thousand milliard") in French, and rarely ''un billion''. * In the French numeral notation, the comma (,) is the [[decimal separator]], whereas a space is used between each group of three digits (fifteen million five hundred thousand and thirty-two should be written as 15 500 032). In finance, the currency symbol is used as a decimal separator or put after the number. For example, €25,048.05 is written either 25 048€05 or 25 048,05 € (always with an extra space between the figure and the currency symbol). * In computing, a [[bit]] is called a bit yet a [[byte]] is called an [[octet (computing)|octet]]<ref>[http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/octet English translation of "Octet"] on [http://dictionary.reverso.net/ Reverso]</ref> (from the Latin root ''octo'', meaning "8"). [[SI prefix]]es are used. * [[24-hour clock]] time is used, with h being the separator between hours and minutes (for example 2:30&nbsp;pm is 14h30). * The all-numeric form for dates is in the order day-month-year, using a slash as the separator (example: 31/12/1992 or 31/12/92).  ==Problem in defining "French" culture== {{See also|Deconstruction|Relativism}} Wherever one comes from, "culture" consists of beliefs and values learned through the socialization process as well as material artifacts.<ref>Jary, D. and J. Jary. 1991. ''The HarperCollins Dictionary of Sociology'', page 101.</ref><ref>Hoult, T. F, ed. 1969.

Whereas [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] posits the notion of the "[[melting-pot]]" and [[cultural diversity]], the expression "French culture" tends to refer implicitly to a specific geographical entity (as, say, "[[metropolitan France]]", generally excluding its [[overseas departments]]) or to a specific historico-sociological group defined by ethnicity, language, religion and geography. The realities of "Frenchness" however, are extremely complicated. Even before the late 18th-19th century, "metropolitan France" was largely a patchwork of local customs and regional differences that the unifying aims of the [[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime]] and the [[French Revolution]] had only begun to work against, and today's France remains a nation of numerous [[French dialects|indigenous]] and foreign languages, of multiple ethnicities and religions, and of regional diversity that includes French citizens in [[Corsica]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and elsewhere around the globe also in America.  The creation of some sort of typical or shared French culture or "[[cultural identity]]", despite this vast heterogeneity, is the result of powerful internal forces &mdash; such as the [[French educational system]], mandatory military service, state linguistic and cultural policies &mdash; and by profound historic events &mdash; such as the [[Franco-Prussian war]] and the two [[World Wars]] &mdash; which have forged a sense of national identity over the last 200 years. However, despite these unifying forces, France today still remains marked by social class and by important regional differences in culture (cuisine, dialect/accent, local traditions) that many fear will be unable to withstand contemporary social forces (depopulation of the countryside, immigration, centralization, market forces and the world economy).  In recent years, to fight the loss of regional diversity, many in France have promoted forms of [[multiculturalism]] and encouraged cultural enclaves (''communautarisme''), including reforms on the preservation of regional languages and the decentralization of certain government functions, but French multiculturalism has had a harder time of accepting, or of integrating into the collective identity, the large non-Christian and immigrant communities and groups that have come to France since the 1960s.  The last 70 years has also seen French cultural identity "threatened" by global market forces and by American "[[cultural hegemony]]". Since its dealings with the 1943 [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] [[free trade]] negotiations, France has fought for what it calls the ''[[Cultural exception|exception culturelle]]'', meaning the right to subsidize or treat favorably domestic cultural production and to limit or control foreign cultural products (as seen in public funding for [[French cinema]] or the lower [[Value added tax|VAT]] accorded to books).  The notion of an explicit ''exception française'' however has angered many of France's critics.<ref>see, for example, [[Jonathan Fenby]]: ''On the Brink: the Trouble with France'' Warner Books London, 1998, ISBN 0316646652</ref>  The French are often perceived as taking a great pride in national identity and the positive achievements of France (the expression "[[chauvinism]]" is of French origin) and cultural issues are more integrated in the body of the politics than elsewhere (see "The Role of the State", below). The [[French Revolution]] claimed [[universalism]] for the democratic principles of the Republic. [[Charles de Gaulle]] actively promoted a notion of French "grandeur" ("greatness").  Perceived declines in cultural status are a matter of national concern and have generated national debates, both from the left (as seen in the anti-globalism of [[José Bové]]) and from the right and far right (as in the discourses of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]).  According to [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Hofstede's Framework for Assessing Culture]], the culture of France is moderately individualistic and high Power Distance Index.  Now, the [[Multiracial|interracial]] blending of some native French and newcomers stands as a vibrant and boasted feature of French culture, from popular music to movies and literature. Therefore, alongside mixing of populations, exists also a cultural blending (''le métissage culturel'') that is present in France. It may be compared to the traditional US conception of the [[melting-pot]]. The French culture might have been already blended in from other races and ethnicities, in cases of some biographical research on the possibility of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] ancestry on a small number of famous French citizens. Author [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] possessed one-fifth black Haitian descent, and [[Empress Josephine]] [[Napoleon]] who was born and raised in the [[French West Indies]] from a plantation estate family.
