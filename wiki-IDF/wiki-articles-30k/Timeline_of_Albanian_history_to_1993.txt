The wars of the Balkan peninsula. Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. p.146 Ptolemy's map shows the city of Albanopolis (located Northeast of Durrës). Ptolemy also mentions the Illyrian tribe named Albanoi, who lived around this city.William Smith, LLD, Ed., Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, 1854. Ptolemy is the earliest writer in whose works the name of the Albanians has been distinctly recognised. He mentions (3.13.23) a tribe called ALBANI (Ἀλβανοί) and a town ALBANOPOLIS (Ἀλβανόπολις), in the region lying to the E. of the Ionian sea; and from the names of places with which Albanopolis is connected, it appears clearly to have been in the S. part of the Illyrian territory, and in modern Albania. There is no means of forming a conjecture on how the name of this obscure tribe came to be extended to so considerable a nation. The area was part of Roman Macedon, specifically the Epirus Nova subdivision.

It is disputed, however, whether the "Albanoi" of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether "Albanoi" is a reference to Normans from Sicily under an archaic name (there was also tribe of Italy by the name of "Albanoi").The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series  Authors Alexandru Madgearu, Martin Gordon  Editor Martin Gordon  Translated by Alexandru Madgearu  Edition illustrated  Publisher Scarecrow Press, 2008 ISBN 0-8108-5846-0, ISBN 978-0-8108-5846-6 It was supposed that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, called by an archaic name (the Albanoi were an independent tribe from Southern Italy), p. 25 However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion in 1078, is undisputed.The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins  G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series  Authors Alexandru Madgearu, Martin Gordon  Editor Martin Gordon  Translated by Alexandru Madgearu  Edition illustrated  Publisher Scarecrow Press, 2008  ISBN 0-8108-5846-0, ISBN 978-0-8108-5846-6 It was supposed that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, called by an archaic name (the Albanoi were an independent tribe from Southern Italy).
