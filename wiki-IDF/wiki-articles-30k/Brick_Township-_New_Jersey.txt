It was converted to a traffic light regulated intersection in 1986, due to an increase in traffic and accidents.  To reduce the need for left turns, a short portion of eastbound Route 88 was re-routed onto Princeton Avenue. Some other movements are controlled by jughandles and a two-way connection in the northwest corner.Moore, Kirk. "History of Traffic Circles", Asbury Park Press, August 24, 2006.

WBGD 91.9FM (Brick Green Dragons) went on the air in 1974 and was originally located at Brick Township High School.  The station was later moved to broadcast from Brick Memorial High School. The radio station was the brainchild of a teacher named Robert Beosch who taught electronics at Brick Township High School in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The station was a student-run radio station and received its original license from the FCC as an educational broadcast license.  The most notable broadcast was the first ever state high school football championship game played between Brick Township High School and Camden High School in December 1974.  The Brick Green Dragons defeated Camden 21 to 20 on the last play of the game to win the first state title. In 2007, during routine roof maintenance and repair work, the broadcast tower was cut off the roof, and was never replaced or repaired. WBGD has ceased operations.
