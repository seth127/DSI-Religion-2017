    Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American worldwide semiconductor company based in Sunnyvale, California, United States, that develops computer-processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. While initially it manufactured its own processors, the company became fabless after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and graphics processors for servers, workstations and personal computers, and embedded systems applications. AMD is the second-largest supplier and only significant rival to Intel in the market for x86-based microprocessors. Since acquiring ATI in 2006, AMD and its competitor Nvidia have dominated the discrete graphics processor unit (GPU) market.   Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated on May 1, 1969, by Jerry Sanders, along with seven of his colleagues from Fairchild Semiconductor.The other founding members were Ed Turney, John Carey, Sven Simonsen, Jack Gifford and three members from Gifford's team: Frank Botte, Jim Giles, and Larry Stenger.Rodengen, p. 30. Sanders, an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at Fairchild, had like many Fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within that company, and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company."Fairchild's Offspring".

"Silicon Insider: AMD-Intel Feud Continues". ABC News. April 24, 2003. In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location in Santa Clara to Sunnyvale, California.Rodengen, p. 36. To immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by Fairchild and National Semiconductor.Pederson, Jay P. International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 30. St. James Press, 2000.Rodengen, p. 35. AMD first focused on producing logic chips.Rodengen, pp. 37–38. The company guaranteed quality control to United States Military Standard, an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers, the telecommunications industry, and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid.Singer, Graham. "The Rise and Fall of AMD". TechSpot. November 21, 2012.Rodengen, pp. 35, 38, 41, 42.AMD Corporation. Silicon Valley Historical Association. 2008. In November 1969, the company manufactured its first product, the Am9300, a 4-bit MSI shift register, which began selling in 1970.Rodengen, pp. 36, 38. Also in 1970, AMD produced its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter, which was highly successful.Lojek, Bo. History of Semiconductor Engineering.  Springer Science & Business Media, 2007. p. 220.Our History. AMD.com. Its best-selling product in 1971 was the Am2505, the fastest multiplier available.Rodengen, p. 41. In 1971, AMD entered the RAM chip market, beginning with the Am3101, a 64-bit bipolar RAM.Electronic Design, Volume 19, Part 3. Hayden Publishing Company, 1971.  p. 227. That year AMD also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits, and by year end the company's total annual sales reached $4.6 million.Rodengen, pp. 42, 43. AMD went public in September 1972.Rodengen, p. 45.Walker, Rob.  "Interview with W. Jerry Sanders". Silicon Genesis. Stanford University. October 18, 2002. The company was a second source for Intel MOS/LSI circuits by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers.Rodengen, p. 46.MOS/LSI Data Book. Advanced Micro Devices, 1980. pp. 5-1, 5-2, B-8. By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a static N-channel 1024-bit RAM)Electrical Design News, Volume 19, Issues 13-24. Rogers Publishing Company, 1974. p. 86. and three low-power Schottky MSI circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.Rodengen, p. 55.

American Experience. PBS. 2013. By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with the Am9080, a reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080,Rodengen, p. 50.Hitt, Michael; Ireland, R. Duane;  Hoskisson, Robert. Strategic Management: Competitiveness and Globalization, Cases, Volume 2. Cengage Learning, 2008. p. 41. and the Am2900 bit-slice microprocessor family. When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a cross-licencing agreement with AMD, granting AMD a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.Lennon, Michael J.

In 1977, AMD entered into a joint venture with Siemens, a German engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the U.S. market.Malerba, Franco. The Semiconductor Business: The Economics of Rapid Growth and Decline. University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. p. 166.

Cahners Publishing Company, 1982. p. 286. When the two companies' vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged, AMD bought out Siemens' stake in the U.S. division in 1979.Rodengen, p. 62."Siemens and Advanced Micro Devices Agree to Split Joint Venture". Wall Street Journal. February 14, 1979. p. 38. AMD closed its Advanced Micro Computers subsidiary in late 1981, after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors.Freiberger, Paul. "AMD sued for alleged misuse of subsidiary's secrets". InfoWorld. June 20, 1983. p. 28.Swaine, Michael. "Eight Companies to produce the 8086 chip". InfoWorld. November 30, 1981. p. 78.Rodengen, p. 73. Total sales in fiscal year 1978 topped $100 million, and in 1979, AMD debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1979, production also began in AMD's new semiconductor fab in Austin; the company already had overseas assembly facilities in Penang and Manila,Rodengen, p. 59. and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in San Antonio in 1981.Hitt, Michael; Ireland, R. Duane; Hoskisson, Robert. Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases. Cengage Learning, 2006. p. C-26. In 1980, AMD began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications, an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation.Rodengen, pp. 65, 71–72, 79–80. Intel had introduced the first x86 microprocessors in 1978.Sanchez, Julio and Maria P. Canton. Software Solutions for Engineers and Scientists.  CRC Press, 2007. p. 95. In 1981, IBM created its PC, and wanted Intel's x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel also provide a second-source manufacturer for its patented x86 microprocessors. Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first signed in October 1981AMD 8086 microprocessor family, CPU World. (Accessed November 3, 2014.) and formally executed in February 1982. The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer for semiconductor products developed by the other; that is, each party could "earn" the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company. The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMD–Intel cross-licensing agreement through 1995. The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice. The main result of the 1982 agreement was that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its 8086, 80186, and 80286 chips. Beginning in 1982, AMD began volume-producing second-source Intel-licensed 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, and by 1984 its own Am286 clone of Intel's 80286 processor, for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs and IBM clones.Ziberg, Christian. "Timeline: How AMD changed over the past 39 years". TGDaily. October 7, 2008. It also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips.International Directory of Company Histories. 1992. In 1983, it introduced INT.STD.1000, the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry. The company continued to spend greatly on research and development,Rodengen, pp. 73, 78–80. and in addition to other breakthrough products, created the world's first 512K EPROM in 1984.Rodengen, p. 80. That year AMD was listed in the book The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America,Levering, Robert; Moskowitz, Milton; Katz, Michael. The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America. Addison-Wesley, 1984. and based on 1984 income it made the Fortune 500 list for the first time in 1985.1985 Full list. Fortune 500. Fortune archive.Rodengen, p. 85. By mid-1985, however, the microchip market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices (dumping) from Japan, but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the U.S.Rodengen, pp. 85–87. AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing,Rodengen, pp. 86, 90, 95, 99. devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for 52 weeks in fiscal year 1986,Rodengen, pp. 90–91. and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions were put into place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing.Rodengen, pp. 87–88, 97–99. During this time period, AMD withdrew from the DRAM market,Rodengen, p. 97. and at the same time made some headway into the CMOS market, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.Rodengen, p. 91. AMD had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 "World Chip" FSK modem, one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex.Computer Design, Volume 25, Issues 13-22. Computer Design Publishing Corporation, 1986. p. 14. Beginning in 1986, AMD embraced the perceived shift toward RISC with their own AMD Am29000 (29k) processor;Rodengen, p. 100. the 29k survived as an embedded processor.Pflanz, Matthias. On-line Error Detection and Fast Recover Techniques for Dependable Embedded Processors. Springer Science & Business Media, 2002. p. 23. The company also increased its EPROM memory market share in the late 1980s.Rodengen, pp. 121–122. Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its own 386-compatible Am386, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.AMD. PC Encyclopedia. PC Magazine. AMD had a large and successful flash memory business, even during the dotcom bust.Ruiz. p. 20. In 2003, to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow, which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel, AMD spun-off its flash memory business and manufacturing into Spansion, a joint venture with Fujitsu, which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with AMD since 1993.Ruiz, pp. 54–55.Spooner, John G. "AMD, Fujitsu merge on flash memory". CNET. July 14, 2003. AMD divested itself of Spansion in December 2005, in order to focus on the microprocessor market, and Spansion went public in an IPO.Yi, Matthew. "Spansion spun off by AMD". San Francisco Chronicle. December 17, 2005. AMD announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ATI Technologies on July 24, 2006. AMD paid $4.3&nbsp;billion in cash and 58&nbsp;million shares of its stock, for a total of approximately $5.4&nbsp;billion. The transaction completed on October 25, 2006. On August 30, 2010, AMD announced that it would retire the ATI brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD brand name.  In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibillion-dollar joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co., an investment company formed by the government of Abu Dhabi. The new venture is called GlobalFoundries Inc.  The partnership and spin-off gave AMD an infusion of cash and allowed AMD to focus solely on chip design. To assure the Abu Dhabi investors of the new venture's success, CEO Hector Ruiz stepped down as CEO of AMD in July 2008, while remaining Executive Chairman, in preparation to becoming Chairman of Global Foundries in March 2009.Ruiz, 159–162.Gruener, Wolfgang.

August 25, 2011. Retrieved August 25, 2011. AMD announced in November 2011 plans to lay off more than 10% (1,400) of its employees from across all divisions worldwide.O'Gara. Maureen. "AMD to Fire 1,400". Virtualization Journal. November 7, 2011. In October 2012, it announced plans to lay off an additional 15% of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue. AMD acquired the low-power server manufacturer SeaMicro in early 2012, with an eye to bringing out an ARM architecture server chip. On October 8, 2014, AMD announced that Rory Read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer. He was succeeded by Lisa Su, a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since June.A.M.D names Lisa Su as chief executive, Bits-Blogs, NYTimes October 8, 2014 On October 16, 2014, AMD announced a new restructuring plan along with its Q3 results. Effective July 1, 2014, AMD reorganized into two business groups: Computing and Graphics, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services, and royalties. As part of this restructuring AMD announced that 7% of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of 2014.AMD Reports 2014 Third Quarter Results. AMD. October 16, 2014. Accessed October 20, 2014.   In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with Intel, becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of 8086 and 8088 processors. IBM wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its IBM PC, but IBM's policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the Am286 under the same arrangement. In 1984 Intel, in order to shore up its advantage in the marketplace, internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying product information, and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the Intel 80386 to AMD.Ruiz, p. 86–87. In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue, and Intel reacted by cancelling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether.Rodengen, p. 102.Ruiz, p. 87. After three years of testimony, AMD eventually won in arbitration in 1992, but Intel disputed this decision. Another long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the Supreme Court of California sided with the arbitrator and AMD. In 1990, Intel also countersued AMD, reneging on AMD's right to use derivatives of Intel's microcode for its cloned processors.Rodengen, p. 116. In the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute, AMD was forced to develop clean room designed versions of Intel code for its x386 and x486 processors, the former long after Intel had released its own x386 in 1985.Rodengen, pp. 116–199. In March 1991, AMD released the Am386, its clone of the Intel 386 processor. By October of the same year it had sold one million units. In 1993, AMD introduced the first of the Am486 family of processors, which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers, including Compaq, which signed an exclusive agreement using the Am486. Another Am486-based processor, the Am5x86, was released in November 1995 and continued AMD's success as a fast, cost-effective processor. Finally, in an agreement effective 1996, AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors.[ ]. pp. 4-36–4-38. AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the K5, which was launched in 1996. The "K" was a reference to Kryptonite. (In comic books, the only substance which could harm Superman was Kryptonite. This is a reference to Intel's hegemony over the market, i.e., an anthropomorphization of them as Superman.) The numeral "5" refers to the fifth generation of x86 processors; rival Intel had previously introduced its line of fifth-generation x86 processors as Pentium because the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked. In 1996, AMD purchased NexGen, specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the K6 processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on Socket 7, variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth-generation processor). The K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut on June 23, 1999, under the brand name Athlon. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's Slot 1 connector, and instead used a Slot A connector, referenced to the Alpha processor bus.  The Duron was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. Sempron was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the socket A PGA era. It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets, up to AM3. On October 9, 2001, the Athlon XP was released. On February 10, 2003, the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache was released.  The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a 64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set (called x86-64, AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point-to-point interconnect called HyperTransport, as part of the Direct Connect Architecture. The technology was initially launched as the Opteron server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003.Scott Wasson. "Workstation platforms compared", techreport.com, The Tech Report, LLC., September 15, 2003, Retrieved on July 29, 2007. Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded Athlon 64.Scott Wasson. "AMD's Athlon 64 processor", techreport.com, The Tech Report, LLC., September 23, 2003. Retrieved on July 29, 2007. On April 21, 2005, AMD released the first dual core Opteron, an x86-based server CPU.Scott Wasson. "AMD's dual-core Opteron processors", techreport.com, The Tech Report, LLC., April 21, 2005. Retrieved on July 29, 2007. A month later, AMD released the Athlon 64 X2, the first desktop-based dual core processor family.Scott Wasson. "AMD's Athlon 64 X2 processors", techreport.com, The Tech Report, LLC., May 9, 2005. Retrieved on July 29, 2007. In May 2007, AMD abandoned the string "64" in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of 64-bit computing in its processors. Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. Thus AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment. After K8 came K10. In September 2007, AMD released the first K10 processors – nine quad-core Third Generation Opteron processors – followed in November by the Phenom processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, triple-core,AMD announcement. Retrieved September 17, 2007. and quad-core versions, with all cores on a single die. AMD released a new platform, codenamed "Spider", which utilized the new Phenom processor, as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series. However, AMD built the Spider at 65nm, which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient 45nm. In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed Phenom II, a refresh of the original Phenom built using the 45&nbsp;nm process. AMD's new platform, codenamed “Dragon”, utilised the new Phenom II processor, and an ATI R770 GPU from the R700 GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series. The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache and a Cool'n'Quiet bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range Core 2 Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced the Phenom's memory controller, allowing it to use DDR3 in a new native socket AM3, while maintaining backwards compatibility with AM2+, the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the DDR2 memory that was used with the platform. In April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed "Thuban". This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core “Istanbul” Opteron processor. It included AMD's “turbo core” technology, which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed. AMD's enthusiast platform, codenamed "Leo", utilized the new Phenom II, a new chipset from the AMD 800 chipset series and an ATI “Cypress” GPU from the Evergreen GPU series.  The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts were released in 2010. The Magny Cours part came in 8 to 12&nbsp;cores and the Lisbon part in 4 and 6&nbsp;core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM (Multi-Chip Module) with two hexa-core “Istanbul” Opteron parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45 nm SOI process.   Following AMD's 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies, an initiative codenamed Fusion was announced to merge a CPU and GPU on some of their mainstream chips, including a minimum 16 lane PCI Express link to accommodate external PCI Express peripherals, thereby eliminating the requirement of a northbridge chip completely from the motherboard. The initiative intended to see some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. floating-point unit operations) moved to the GPU, which is better optimized for calculations such as floating-point unit calculations. This is referred to by AMD as an accelerated processing unit (APU). Llano is to be the second APU released, targeted at the mainstream market. This will incorporate a CPU and GPU on the same die, as well as the northbridge functions, and labeled on AMD's new timeline as using "Socket FM1" with DDR3 memory. This will, however, not be based on the new bulldozer core and will in fact be similar to the current Phenom II "Deneb" processor serving as AMD's high-end processor until the release of the new 32&nbsp;nm parts. On September 28, 2011, AMD said that the third quarter of 2011 won't have a 10% revenue increase as AMD planned before, because of the manufacturing problem with the 32&nbsp;nm Llano Fusion chips.Jeffrey Burt, eWeek. "AMD Cuts Q3 Forecast Due to Chip Manufacturing Problems". September 28, 2011. Retrieved October 7, 2011. More Currently, APUs for laptops running Windows 7 and Windows 8 OS are being used much more commonly. These include AMD's price-point APus, the E1 and E2, and their mainstream competitors with Intel's core i-series: The Vision A- series, the A standing for accelerated. These range from the lower-performance A4 chipset to the A6, A8, and A10. These all incorporate Next-generation Radeon graphics cards, with the A4 utilizing the base Radeon HD chip and the rest using a Radeon R4 graphics card, with the exception of the highest-model A10 (A10-7300) which uses an R6 graphics card. Bulldozer is AMD's CPU codename for the second latest server and desktop processors released on October 12, 2011. This family 15h microarchitecture is the successor to the family 10h (K10) microarchitecture M-SPACE design methodology. Bulldozer is designed from scratch, not a development of earlier processors. The core is specifically aimed at 10-125&nbsp;W TDP computing products. AMD claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were very high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance competitive with arch rival Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K10 model they were built to replace. Hondo is AMD's latest processor series used in Tablet computers. Vishera is AMD's current FX series processor lineup targeting the desktop performance market. It uses 2nd generation Bulldozer-derived cores codenamed Piledriver. Llano was AMD's first APU built for laptops. Jaguar is the latest x86 processor core from AMD aimed at the low-power/low-cost market. Jaguar's predecessor, Bobcat, was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice-president Henri Richard in Computex 2007 and was put into production Q1 2011. One of the major supporters was executive vice-president Mario A. Rivas who felt it was difficult to compete in the x86 market with a single core optimized for the 10-100&nbsp;W range and actively promoted the development of the simpler core with a target range of 1-10&nbsp;watts. In addition, it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1&nbsp;W. AMD intends to release 64-bit ARM System on Chips (SoC) that will begin sampling in early 2014 and shipping in the second half of 2015.  They will be for use in servers as a low-power alternative to current x86 chips.  Their implementation using the ARM architecture is codenamed "Seattle", based on the Cortex A57 core design (ARMv8-A), and will contain 8 and 16 cores each.  They will include the proprietary SeaMicro "Freedom Fabric", as well as support for 128&nbsp;GB RAM, and 10 gigabit Ethernet. This is to be followed by the custom ARM core K12 core, expected in 2016-2017. Zen is a new architecture built from the ground up by a team led by Jim Keller, beginning with his arrival in 2012, and taping out before his departure in September 2015. Zen will be built on the 14&nbsp;nm node and have a renewed focus on single-core performance and HSA compatibility. Zen will be the first chip encompassing CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a single socket. It will also support DDR4. It is expected to be released mid-late 2016, following the availability of the AMD A10-7890K FM2+ desktop CPU. AMD's portfolio of dedicated graphics processors  includes product families and associated technologies aimed at the consumer, professional and high-performance computing markets, such as:  technologies found in AMD products include: AMD Catalyst is a collection of proprietary device driver software available for Microsoft Windows and Linux. Since 2007, AMD has participated in the development of free and open-source graphics device drivers. The programming specifications for a number of chipsets and features were published in several rounds. Employees hired by AMD for this purpose contribute code to the Direct Rendering Manager in the Linux kernel.  Before the launch of Athlon 64 processors in 2003, AMD designed chipsets for their processors spanning the K6 and K7 processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751 and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of Athlon 64 processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the “Open Platform Management Architecture” with ATI, VIA and SiS developing their own chipset for Athlon 64 processors and later Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon 64 FX processors, including the Quad FX platform chipset from Nvidia. The initiative went further with the release of Opteron server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today, Nvidia and Broadcom are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors. As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the Radeon Xpress 200 and the Radeon Xpress 3200 chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as AMD 580X CrossFire chipset). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD 690G chipset (previously under the development codename RS690), targeted at mainstream IGP computing. It was the industry's first to implement a HDMI 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of Radeon Xpress 1250 (codenamed RS600, sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of  FSB to ATI. On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the AMD 7-Series chipsets, covering from enthusiast multi-graphics segment to value IGP segment, to replace the AMD 480/570/580 chipsets and AMD 690 series chipsets, marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset.  Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007 as part of the codenamed Spider desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring 2008 as part of the codenamed Cartwheel platform. AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the AMD 800S series server chipsets. It includes support for up to six SATA 6.0 Gbit/s ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in Fusion processors and AHCI 1.2 with SATA FIS–based switching support. This is a chipset family supporting Phenom processors and Quad FX enthusiast platform (890FX), IGP(890GX).  , AMD LIVE! was a platform marketing initiative focusing the consumer electronics segment, with an Active TV initiative for streaming Internet videos from web video services such as YouTube, into AMD Live!

AMD processors using Socket AM2, Socket S1, and Socket F include AMD Virtualization support. AMD Virtualization is also supported by release two (8200, 2200 and 1200 series) of the Opteron processors. The third generation (8300 and 2300 series) of Opteron processors will see an update in virtualization technology, specifically the Rapid Virtualization Indexing (also known by the development name Nested Page Tables), alongside the tagged TLB and Device Exclusion Vector (DEV). AMD also promotes the "AMD I/O Virtualization Technology" (also known as IOMMU) for I/O virtualization. The AMD IOMMU specification has been updated to version 1.2. The specification describes the use of a HyperTransport architecture. AMD's server initiatives include the following:  Starting in 2007, AMD, following Intel, began using codenames for its desktop platforms such as Spider or Dragon. The platforms, unlike Intel's approach, will refresh every year, putting focus on platform specialization. The platform includes components such as AMD processors, chipsets, ATI graphics and other features, but continued to the open platform approach, and welcome components from other vendors such as VIA, SiS, and Nvidia, as well as wireless product vendors. Updates to the platform includes the implementation of IOMMU I/O Virtualization with 45 nm generation of processors, and the AMD 800 chipset series in 2009.AMD Financial Analyst Day 2007 presentation, presented by Mario Rivas, page 24 of 28.

On June 13, 2006, AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics, Inc., a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications. In August 2003, AMD also purchased the Geode business which was originally the Cyrix MediaGX from National Semiconductor to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products. During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors  and , and  processor with fan, of TDP 25&nbsp;W. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several UMPC designs in Asia markets, as well as the OLPC XO-1 computer, an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world.  The Geode LX processor was announced in 2005 and is said will continue to be available through 2015. For the past couple of years AMD has been introducing 64-bit processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD Opteron processor.  Leveraging the high throughput enabled through HyperTransport and the Direct Connect Architecture these server class processors have been targeted at high end telecom and storage applications. In 2007, AMD added the AMD Athlon, AMD Turion and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same 64-bit instruction set and Direct Connect Architecture as the AMD Opteron but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008, AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and dual-core AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded 64-bit solutions starting with 8W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.AMD Embedded Solutions that are scalable, x86- based, low-power and feature-rich products.

Ever since the spin-off of AMD's fabrication plants in early 2009, GlobalFoundries has been responsible for producing AMD's processors. GlobalFoundries' main microprocessor manufacturing facilities are located in Dresden, Germany. Additionally, highly integrated microprocessors are manufactured in Taiwan made by third-party manufacturers under strict license from AMD. Between 2003 and 2005, they constructed a second manufacturing plant ( 90 nm process SOI) in the same complex in order to increase the number of chips they could produce, thus becoming more competitive with Intel. The new plant was named "Fab 36", in recognition of AMD's 36 years of operation, and reached full production in mid-2007. Fab 36 was renamed to "Fab 1" during the spin-off of AMD's manufacturing business during the creation of GlobalFoundries. In July 2007, AMD announced that they completed the conversion of Fab 1 Module 1 from  to 65 nm.  They then shifted their focus to the 45 nm conversion.Rick C. Hodgin.

A partnership between AMD and Alpha Processor Inc. developed HyperTransport, a point-to-point interconnect standard which was turned over to an industry standards body for finalization. It is now used in modern motherboards that are compatible with AMD processors. AMD also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, under which AMD gained silicon on insulator (SOI) manufacturing technology, and detailed advice on 90 nm implementation. AMD announced that the partnership would extend to 2011 for 32 nm and 22 nm fabrication-related technologies.AMD Analyst Day June 2006 Presentation, slide 10   To facilitate processor distribution and sales, AMD is loosely partnered with end-user companies, such as HP, Compaq, ASUS, Acer, and Dell. In 1993, AMD established a 50-50 partnership with Fujitsu called FASL, and merged into a new company called FASL LLC in 2003. The joint venture went public under the name Spansion and ticker symbol SPSN in December 2005, with AMD shares drop to 37%. AMD no longer directly participates in the Flash memory devices market now as AMD entered into a non-competition agreement, as of December 21, 2005, with Fujitsu and Spansion, pursuant to which it agreed not to directly or indirectly engage in a business that manufactures or supplies standalone semiconductor devices (including single chip, multiple chip or system devices) containing only Flash memory. On May 18, 2006, Dell announced that it would roll out new servers based on AMD's Opteron chips by year's end, thus ending an exclusive relationship with Intel.
