 Sir Michael Philip "Mick" Jagger  (born 26 July 1943) is an English singer, songwriter and actor, best known as the lead vocalist and a co-founder of The Rolling Stones. Jagger's career has spanned over 50 years, and he has been described as "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll". His distinctive voice and performance, along with Keith Richards' guitar style, have been the trademark of the Rolling Stones throughout the career of the band. Jagger gained press notoriety for his admitted drug use and romantic involvements, and was often portrayed as a countercultural figure. In the late 1960s Jagger began acting in films (starting with Performance and Ned Kelly), to mixed reception. In 1985 Jagger released his first solo album, She's the Boss. In early 2009 he joined the electric supergroup SuperHeavy. In 1989 Jagger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004 into the UK Music Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones. In 2003 he was knighted for his services to popular music.  Michael Philip Jagger was born into a middle-class family in Dartford, Kent. His father, Basil Fanshawe "Joe" Jagger (13 April 1913&nbsp;– 11 November 2006), and grandfather, David Ernest Jagger, were both teachers. His mother, Eva Ensley Mary (née Scutts; 6 April 1913&nbsp;– 18 May 2000), born in New South Wales, Australia, of English descent, was a hairdresser and an active member of the Conservative Party. Jagger's younger brother, Chris (born 19 December 1947) is also a musician. The two have performed together. Although brought up to follow his father's career path, Jagger "was always a singer" as he stated in According to the Rolling Stones. "I always sang as a child. I was one of those kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. I was in the church choir and I also loved listening to singers on the radio--the BBC or Radio Luxembourg--or watching them on TV and in the movies." In September 1950, Keith Richards and Jagger were classmates at Wentworth Primary School, Dartford, Kent. In 1954, Jagger passed the eleven-plus and went to Dartford Grammar School, which now has the Mick Jagger Centre installed within the school's site, named for its most famous alumnus. Jagger and Richards lost contact with each other when they went to different schools, but after a chance encounter at Dartford Station in July 1960, resumed their friendship and discovered their shared love of rhythm and blues, which for Jagger had begun with Little Richard.White, Charles. (2003), pp. 119-120, The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography, Omnibus Press. Jagger left school in 1961 after obtaining seven O-levels and three A-levels. Jagger and Richards moved into a flat in Edith Grove in Chelsea, London with a guitarist they had encountered named Brian Jones. While Richards and Jones planned to start their own rhythm and blues group, Jagger continued studying business courses at the London School of Economics,"Mick Jagger" entry, Contemporary Musicians, Volume 53. Thomson Gale, 2005. and had seriously considered becoming either a journalist or a politician, comparing the latter to a pop star.Christopher Andersen, Jagger, published by Delacorte Press, New York, 1993, p. 49George Tremlet, The Rolling Stones Story, Futura Publications Ltd., London, 1974, pp. 109–10  In their earliest days the members played for no money in the interval of Alexis Korner's gigs at a basement club opposite Ealing Broadway tube station (subsequently called "Ferry's" club). At the time, the group had very little equipment and needed to borrow Alexis' gear to play. This was before Andrew Loog Oldham became their manager. The group's first appearance under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite Muddy Waters tunes) was at the Marquee Club in London, a jazz club, on 12 July 1962. They would later change their name to "the Rolling Stones" as it seemed more formal. Victor Bockris states that the band members included Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Ian Stewart on piano, Dick Taylor on bass and Tony Chapman on drums. However, Richards states in Life that "The drummer that night was Mick Avory--not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down..."Richards, Keith. Life. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 2010. 97. Print. Avory himself has categorically denied "on many occasions"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll, The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones, James Karnbach and Carol Bernson, Facts On File, Inc., New York, NY, 1997 that he played with the Rollin' Stones that night. In fact he only rehearsed twice with them in the Bricklayers Arms pub, before they became known as the Rollin' Stones. Some time later the band went on their first tour in the United Kingdom; this was known as the "training ground" tour, because it was a new experience for all of them.Wyman, Bill. Rolling With the Stones New York: DK Publishing, 2002. 36. Print The line-up did not at that time include drummer Charlie Watts or bassist Bill Wyman. By 1963 they were finding their musical stride as well as popularity. By 1964 two unscientific opinion polls rated them as Britain's most popular group, even outranking the Beatles. By autumn 1963 Jagger had left the London School of Economics in favour of his promising musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group continued to mine the works of American rhythm and blues artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but with the strong encouragement of Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write their own songs. This core songwriting partnership would flourish in time; one of their early compositions, "As Tears Go By", was a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting at the time.Jagger, Richards, Watts & Wood 2003. p. 84. For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write "The Last Time", the group's third No. 1 single in the UK (their first two UK No. 1 hits had been cover versions) based on "This May Be the Last Time", a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Another fruit of this collaboration was their first international hit, "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It also established the Rolling Stones' image as defiant troublemakers in contrast to the Beatles' "lovable moptop" image. Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: "I wasn't trying to be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from suburbia who sings in this band, but someone older might have thought it was just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame."Vanity Fair, February 1992. The group released several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, but in their personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967 Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison).Andersen, pp.148–49 However the Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.Greenspan, Edward (editor), Regina v. Richards 49 C.C.C. (2d), Canadian Criminal Cases (1980), Canada Law Book. p. 517–27  In 1970 Jagger bought "Stargroves", a manor house and estate in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones and several other bands recorded there using a mobile studio. After Jones's death and their move in 1971 to the south of France as tax exiles,Andersen, p. 247. Jagger and the rest of the band changed their look and style as the 1970s progressed. He also learned to play guitar and contributed guitar parts for certain songs on Sticky Fingers (1971) and all subsequent albums (with the exception of Dirty Work in 1986). For the Rolling Stones' highly publicised 1972 American tour, Jagger wore glam-rock clothing and glittery makeup on stage. Later in the decade they ventured into genres like disco and punk with the album Some Girls (1978). Their interest in the blues, however, had been made manifest in the 1972 album Exile on Main St. His emotional singing on the gospel-influenced "Let It Loose", one of the album's tracks, has been described by music critic Russell Hall as having been Jagger's finest-ever vocal achievement.Gibson Lifestyle, Deepest Cut: The Rolling Stones Let It Loose from 1972's Exile on Main Street, by Russell Hall 20 February 2008 After the band's acrimonious split with their second manager, Allen Klein, in 1971, Jagger took control of their business affairs after speaking with an up-and-coming front man, J. B. Silver, and has managed them ever since in collaboration with his friend and colleague, Rupert Löwenstein. Mick Taylor, Brian Jones's replacement, left the band in December 1974 and was replaced by Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood in 1975, who also operated as a mediator within the group, and between Jagger and Richards in particular."10 Questions for Ron Wood". Time. Retrieved 3 December 2014  While continuing to tour and release albums with the Rolling Stones, Jagger began a solo career. In 1985 he released his first solo album She's the Boss, produced by Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell, and featuring Herbie Hancock, Jeff Beck, Jan Hammer, Pete Townshend and the Compass Point All Stars. It sold fairly well, and the single "Just Another Night" was a Top Ten hit. During this period, he collaborated with the Jacksons on the song "State of Shock", sharing lead vocals with Michael Jackson. For his own personal contributions in the 1985 Live Aid multi-venue charity concert, he performed at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium; he did a duet with Tina Turner of "It's Only Rock and Roll", and the performance was highlighted by Jagger tearing away Turner's skirt. He also did a cover of "Dancing in the Street" with David Bowie, who himself appeared at Wembley Stadium. The video was shown simultaneously on the screens of both Wembley and JFK Stadiums. The song reached number one in the UK the same year. In 1987 he released his second solo album, Primitive Cool. While it failed to match the commercial success of his debut, it was critically well received. In 1988 he produced the songs "Glamour Boys" and "Which Way to America" on Living Colour's album Vivid. Between 15 and 28 March he had a solo concert tour in Japan (Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka)."Mick Jagger Tour Rolls in Japan". Rolling Stone. Retrieved 3 December 2014 Wandering Spirit was the third solo album by Jagger and was released in 1993. It would be his only solo album release of the 1990s. Jagger aimed to re-introduce himself as a solo artist in a musical climate vastly changed from that of his first two albums, She's the Boss and Primitive Cool. Following the successful comeback of the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels (1989), which saw the end of Jagger and Richards' well-publicised feud, after acquiring Rick Rubin as co-producer in January 1992 Jagger began recording the album in Los Angeles over seven months until September 1992, recording simultaneously as Richards was making Main Offender. Jagger would keep the celebrity guests to a minimum on Wandering Spirit, only having Lenny Kravitz as a vocalist on his cover of Bill Withers' "Use Me" and bassist Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers on three tracks. Following the end of the Rolling Stones' Sony Music contract and their signing to Virgin Records, Jagger signed with Atlantic Records (which had signed the Stones in the 1970s) to distribute what would be his only album with the label. Released in February 1993, Wandering Spirit was commercially successful, reaching No.12 in the UK and No.11 in the US."Mick Jagger - UK Charts". Official Charts Company."Mick Jagger - Billboard Charts". Billboard.  In 2001 Jagger released Goddess in the Doorway spawning the hit single "Visions of Paradise". In the same year he also joined Keith Richards in the Concert for New York City, a charity concert in response to the 11 September attacks, to sing "Salt of the Earth" and "Miss You"."Concert for New York City - Various Artists".

Retrieved 22 November 2014 He celebrated the Rolling Stones' 40th anniversary by touring with them on the year-long Licks Tour in support of their career retrospective Forty Licks double album. In 2007 the Rolling Stones made US$437&nbsp;million on their A Bigger Bang Tour, which got them into the current edition of Guinness World Records for the most lucrative music tour. Jagger has refused to say when the band will retire, stating in 2007: "I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours. We've got no plans to stop any of that really." In October 2009 Jagger and U2 performed "Gimme Shelter" (with Fergie and will.i.am) and "Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of" at the 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert. On 20 May 2011 Jagger announced the formation of a new supergroup, SuperHeavy, which includes Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and A.R. Rahman. Jagger has featured on will.i.am's 2011 single "T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)". It was officially released to iTunes on 4 February 2012.  On 21 February 2012 Mick Jagger, B.B. King, Buddy Guy and Jeff Beck, along with a blues ensemble, performed at the White House concert series before President Barack Obama. When Jagger held out a mic to him, Obama sang twice the line "Come on, baby don't you want to go" of the blues cover 'Sweet Home Chicago', the blues anthem of Obama's home town. Jagger hosted the season finale of Saturday Night Live on 19 and 20 May 2012, doing several comic skits and playing some of the Rolling Stones' hits with Arcade Fire, Foo Fighters, and Jeff Beck. Jagger performed in 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief with the Rolling Stones on 12 December 2012. The Stones finally played the Glastonbury festival in 2013, headlining on Saturday 29 June. This was followed by two concerts in London's Hyde Park as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, their first in the Park since their famous 1969 performance. In 2013 Mick Jagger teamed up with his brother Chris Jagger for two new duets to mark the 40th anniversary of Chris' debut album.  Jagger's relationship with band mate Richards is frequently described as "love/hate" by the media.[ ] – IrelandOn-Line  Richards himself said in a 1998 interview: "I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's because no one else has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done." Richards, along with Johnny Depp, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jagger to appear in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, alongside Depp and Richards. Richards' autobiography, Life, was released on 26 October 2010. On 15 October 2010, the Associated Press published an article stating that Richards refers to Jagger as "unbearable" in the book and notes that their relationship has been strained "for decades." Jagger has also had an intermittent acting career, most notably in Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968) and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. He auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by the original performer from its run on London's West End, Tim Curry. The same year he was personally approached by director Alejandro JodorowskyJodorowsky's Dune (2013), Frank Pavich, Documentary to play the role of Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, but the movie never made it to the screen. He appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978. In the late 1970s Jagger was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski) and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production resulted in his being unable to continue, due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some of the footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. He developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2002). In 1995 Jagger founded Jagged Films with Victoria Pearman.Peter Wynter Bee (2007). "People of the Day 2, Volume 2". p. 81. People of the Day Limited Its first release was the World War II drama Enigma in 2001. That same year it produced a documentary on Jagger entitled Being Mick. The programme, which first aired on television 22 November, coincided with the release of his fourth solo album, Goddess in the Doorway. In 2008 the company began work on The Women, an adaptation of the George Cukor film of the same name. It was directed by Diane English. The Rolling Stones have been the subjects of numerous documentaries, including Gimme Shelter, which was filmed during the band's 1969 tour of the US, and 1968's Sympathy for the Devil directed by French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard. Martin Scorsese worked with Jagger on Shine a Light, a documentary film featuring the Rolling Stones with footage from the A Bigger Bang Tour during two nights of performances at New York's Beacon Theatre. It screened in Berlin in February 2008. Variety's Todd McCarthy said the film "takes full advantage of heavy camera coverage and top-notch sound to create an invigorating musical trip down memory lane, as well as to provoke gentle musings on the wages of ageing and the passage of time." He predicted the film would fare better once released to video than in its limited theatrical runs. Jagger was a co-producer of, and guest-starred in the first episode of, the short-lived comedy American television series The Knights of Prosperity. He also co-produced the 2014 James Brown biopic, Get On Up.  Jagger has been married (and divorced) once, and also has had several other relationships. From 1966 to 1970 he had a relationship with Marianne Faithfull, the singer/songwriter/actress with whom he wrote "Sister Morphine", a song on the Rolling Stones' 1971 album Sticky Fingers. In 1970 he met Nicaraguan-born Bianca De Macias. They married on 12 May 1971 in a Catholic ceremony in Saint-Tropez, France. They separated in 1977, and in May 1978 she filed for divorce on the grounds of his adultery.Nicholas Fonseca, Limited Engagement, Entertainment Weekly In late 1977 Jagger began seeing model Jerry Hall; they moved in together and had four children. They attended an unofficial private marriage ceremony in Bali, in Indonesia, on 21 November 1990, and lived at Downe House in Richmond, London. The marriage and the marriage ceremony were declared invalid, unlawful, and null and void by the High Court of England and Wales in London in 1999. Jagger had a relationship with fashion designer L'Wren Scott from 2001 until her suicide in 2014. She left her entire estate, estimated at about US$9 million, to him. Jagger has seven children with four women: *With Marsha Hunt, he has daughter Karis Hunt Jagger (born 4 November 1970). *With wife Bianca Jagger, he has daughter Jade Sheena Jezebel Jagger (born 21 October 1971).Christopher Andersen "Mick Jagger" *With Jerry Hall, he has daughter Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Scarlett Jagger (born 2 March 1984), son James Leroy Augustin Jagger (born 28 August 1985), daughter Georgia May Ayeesha Jagger (born 12 January 1992), and son Gabriel Luke Beauregard Jagger (born 9 December 1997). *With Luciana Gimenez, he has a son, Lucas Maurice Morad Jagger (born 18 May 1999). He also has five grandchildren, and became a great-grandfather on 19 May 2014, when Jade's daughter Assisi gave birth to a daughter.  In 2008 it was revealed that members of the Hells Angels had plotted to murder Jagger in 1975. They were angered by Jagger having publicly blamed the Angels, who had been hired to provide security at the Altamont Free Concert in December 1969, for much of the crowd violence at the event, in which Meredith Hunter, a black man, was stabbed and beaten to death by several Angels. Three other people also died at the event, attended by 350,000 people. Meredith Curly Hunter, Jr. (24 October 1951 – 6 December 1969) was an 18-year-old African-American man who was killed at the 1969 Altamont Free Concert. During the performance by The Rolling Stones, Hunter approached the stage, and was violently driven off by members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club who had been contracted to serve as ushers and security guards. He subsequently returned to the stage area, drew a revolver, and was stabbed to death by Hells Angel Alan Passaro. The incident was caught on camera and became a central scene in the documentary Gimme Shelter. Passaro was charged with murder. After an eight-man, four-woman jury deliberated for 12 and a half hours, following 17 days of testimony, Passaro was acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The conspirators reportedly used a boat to approach a residence where Jagger was staying on Long Island, New York; the plot failed when the boat nearly sank in a storm and the plotters were forced to swim for their lives."Storm thwarted Mick Jagger murder attempt" The Telegraph, 2 March 2008. Basil "Joe" Jagger died of pneumonia on 11 November 2006 at age 93. Although the Rolling Stones were on the A Bigger Bang Tour, Jagger flew to Britain on Friday to see his father before returning to Las Vegas the same day, where he was to perform on Saturday night. The show went ahead as scheduled. Jagger is an avid cricket fan. He founded Jagged Internetworks to cover English cricket.

Retrieved 3 December 2014 In August 2014 Jagger was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. His personal fortune was estimated in 2010 at £190&nbsp;million (~$298&nbsp;million&nbsp;US). In the Queen's Birthday Honours 2002 Jagger was appointed a Knight Bachelor for services to popular music and on 12 December 2003 he was knighted by HRH The Prince of Wales. Mick Jagger's knighthood received mixed reactions. Some fans were disappointed when he accepted the honour as it seemed to contradict his anti-establishment stance. As UPI noted in December 2003, Jagger has no "known record of charitable work or public services" although he is a patron of the British Museum. Jagger was on record as saying "apart from the Rolling Stones, the Queen is the best thing Britain has got", but was absent from the Queen's Golden Jubilee pop concert at Buckingham Palace that marked her 50 years on the throne.United Press International, 4 December 2003. Queen Elizabeth reportedly refused to award Jagger in person, sharing as she did many of the popular prejudices against the singer. Charlie Watts was quoted in the book According to the Rolling Stones as saying, "Anybody else would be lynched: 18 wives and 20 children and he's knighted, fantastic!"The Rolling Stones. According to the Rolling Stones, ISBN 0-8118-4060-3 The ceremony took place in December 2003. Jagger’s father and daughters Karis and Elizabeth were in attendance. Jagger's knighthood also caused some friction between him and bandmate Keith Richards, who was irritated when Jagger accepted the "paltry honour". Richards said that he did not want to take the stage with someone wearing a "coronet and sporting the old ermine. It's not what the Stones is about, is it?" Jagger retorted: "I think he would probably like to get the same honour himself. It's like being given an ice cream—one gets one and they all want one."  From the time that the Rolling Stones developed their anti-establishment image in the mid-1960s, Mick Jagger, with guitarist Keith Richards, has been an enduring icon of the counterculture. This was enhanced by his controversial drug-related arrests, sexually charged on-stage antics, provocative song lyrics, and his role of the bisexual Turner in the 1970 film Performance. One of his biographers, Christopher Andersen, describes him as "one of the dominant cultural figures of our time", adding that Jagger was "the story of a generation".Christopher Andersen, Jagger, introduction, published by Delacorte Press, New York, 1993 Jagger, who at the time described himself as an anarchist and espoused the leftist slogans of the era, took part in a demonstration against the Vietnam War outside the US Embassy in London in 1968. This event inspired him to write "Street Fighting Man" that same year.Andersen, pp. 179–180 A variety of celebrities attended a lavish party at New York's St. Regis Hotel to celebrate Jagger's 29th birthday and the end of the band's 1972 American tour. The party made the front pages of the leading New York newspapers.Andersen, p. 274  Pop artist Andy Warhol painted a series of silkscreen portraits of Jagger in 1975, one of which was owned by Farah Diba, wife of the Shah of Iran. It hung on a wall inside the royal palace in Tehran.Andersen, p.314 In 1967 Cecil Beaton photographed Jagger's naked buttocks, a photo that sold at Sotheby's auction house in 1986 for $4,000.Andersen, p. 139 Jagger was allegedly a contender for the anonymous subject of Carly Simon's 1973 hit song "You're So Vain", in which he sings backing vocals.Andersen, p. 265 Although Don McLean does not use Jagger's name in his famous song "American Pie", he alludes to Jagger onstage at Altamont, calling him Satan.Andersen, p. 228 In 2010 a retrospective exhibition of portraits of Mick Jagger was presented at the festival Rencontres d'Arles, in France. The catalogue of the exhibition is the first photo album of Mick Jagger and shows his evolution over 50 years. He was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by the Guardian in March 2013. Maroon 5's popular song "Moves like Jagger" is about Jagger. Jagger himself acknowledged the song in an interview, calling the concept "very flattering." Jagger is also referenced in Kesha's song "Tik Tok", the Black Eyed Peas' hit "The Time (Dirty Bit)", and his vocal delivery is referenced by rapper Kanye West in the T.I. and Jay-Z single "Swagga Like Us". The 2000 film Almost Famous, set in 1973, refers to Jagger: "Because if you think Mick Jagger'll still be out there, trying to be a rock star at age 50... you're sadly, sadly mistaken."John McMillian (2013). "Beatles Vs. Stones". p. 227. Simon and Schuster, In the words of British dramatist and novelist Philip Norman, "the only point concerning Mick Jagger's influence over 'young people' that doctors and psychologists agreed on was that it wasn't, under any circumstances, fundamentally harmless."Philip Norman, Symphony for the devil: the Rolling Stones story, p.173. Linden Press/Simon & Schuster, 1984. According to Norman, even Elvis Presley at his most scandalous had not exerted a "power so wholly and disturbingly physical": "Presley", he wrote in 1984, "while he made girls scream, did not have Jagger's ability to make men feel uncomfortable." Norman also associates the early performances of Jagger with the Rolling Stones in the 1960s as a male ballet dancer, with "his conflicting and colliding sexuality: the swan's neck and smeared harlot eyes allied to an overstuffed and straining codpiece." Other authors also attribute similar connotations to Jagger. His performance style has been studied in the academic field as an analysis concerning gender, image and sexuality.David Pattie, Rock music in performance, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. ISBN 1-4039-4746-5 It has been written for example that his performance style "opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now an integral part of contemporary youth culture".Sheila Whiteley, Sexing the groove: popular music and gender, Routledge, 1997, p.67. ISBN 0-415-14670-4 His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of acting—which creates a question concerning the singer's relationship to his own words.Simon Frith, Performing rites: on the value of popular music, Harvard University Press, 1998, p.171. ISBN 0-674-66196-6 His voice has been described as a powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience and expressing an alternative vision of society.Australasian journal of American studies, Volume 20, 2001, p.107.

To express "virility and unrestrained passion" he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as "the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound". Steven Van Zandt also wrote: "The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock & roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird – even Bob Dylan."Steven Van Zandt. "100 Greatest Artists: The Rolling Stones". Rolling Stone. Consulted on 3 October 2011. AllMusic has described Jagger as "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll". Musician David Bowie joined many rock bands with blues, folk and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid-1960s, and he was to recall: "I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger".Christopher Sandford, Bowie: Loving the Alien. Time Warner, pp.29-30. ISBN 0-306-80854-4. Bowie would also offer that "I think Mick Jagger would be astounded and amazed if he realized that to many people he is not a sex symbol, but a mother image." Jagger appeared on Rolling Stone List of 100 Greatest Singers at number 16; in the article, Lenny Kravitz wrote: "I sometimes talk to people who sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. [...] His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection."Lenny Kravitz. "100 Greatest Singers: Mick Jagger". Rolling Stone.

More recently, his cultural legacy is also associated with his ageing accompanied by some vitality. Bon Jovi frontman Jon Bon Jovi, also a veteran, has said: "We continue to make Number One records and fill stadiums. But will we still be doing 150 shows per tour? I just can't see it. I don't know how the hell Mick Jagger does it at 67. That would be the first question I'd ask him. He runs around the stage as much as I do yet he's got almost 20 years on me.""
