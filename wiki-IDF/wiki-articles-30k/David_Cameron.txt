        David William Donald Cameron (; born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who has served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 2010, as Leader of the Conservative Party since 2005 and as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Witney since 2001. Cameron studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford. He then joined the Conservative Research Department and became special adviser, first to Norman Lamont and then to Michael Howard. He was Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications for seven years. Cameron first stood for Parliament in Stafford in 1997. He ran on a Eurosceptic platform, breaking with his party's then-policy by opposing British membership of the single European currency, and was defeated by a swing close to the national average. He was first elected to Parliament in the 2001 general election for the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney. He was promoted to the Opposition front bench two years later and rose rapidly to become head of policy co-ordination during the 2005 general election campaign. With a public image of a youthful, moderate candidate who would appeal to young voters, he won the Conservative leadership election in 2005. Following the election of a hung parliament in the 2010 general election, Cameron became Prime Minister as the leader of a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. The 43-year-old Cameron became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997. He was re-elected as Prime Minister in the 2015 general election with the Conservatives winning a surprise parliamentary majority for the first time since 1992, despite consistent predictions of a second hung parliament. He is the first Prime Minister to be re-elected immediately after serving a full term with an increased popular vote share since Lord Salisbury in 1900 and the only Prime Minister other than Margaret Thatcher to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a greater share of the seats. Cameron's premiership has been marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis leading to a large deficit in government finances, which his government has emphasised the need to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education and healthcare, by introducing the Welfare Reform Act of 2012, the Education Act of 2011, the Health and Social Care Act of 2012 and a range of immigration reforms from 2010 onwards, culminating in the Immigration Act of 2014. In 2011, Cameron became the first British Prime Minister to 'veto' an EU treaty. His government introduced a nationwide referendum on voting reform in 2011 and a Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum in 2013, agreed to a Scottish independence referendum in September 2014 (which resulted in a 'No' to independence majority), legalised same-sex marriages in England and Wales, and met the United Nations target of spending at least 0.7% of GNI on aid to developing countries. In 2013, Cameron promised an 'In/Out' referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union before the end of 2017, after a period of renegotiation, if the Conservatives were to gain a majority in the 2015 general election; the referendum was legislated following their victory.  David Cameron is the younger son of stockbroker Ian Donald Cameron (12 October 1932&nbsp;– 8 September 2010) and his wife Mary Fleur (née Mount, born 1934, a retired JP and daughter of Sir William Mount).Debrett's Peerage 2011, p. B 714. Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962. Cameron was born in Marylebone, London, and brought up at Peasemore, Berkshire. Cameron has a brother, Alexander Cameron (born 1963, a barrister and QC),  and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971). His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010; Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes, who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago and returned to Scotland in the 1880s.Clark, Ross (26 January 2002). "Highlands for the high life". The Daily Telegraph (London). Retrieved 4 September 2007. Cameron has said: "On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh and English". He has also referenced the German-Jewish ancestry of his maternal great-grandfather.  From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its alumni. Due to good academic grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early. At the age of thirteen, he went to Eton College in Berkshire, following his father and elder brother.Elliott, Francis; Hanning, James (2007). Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative. London: Fourth Estate. p. 26. ISBN 978-0-00-724366-2 His early interest was in art. Six weeks before taking his O-Levels he was caught smoking cannabis. He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled, but was fined, prevented from leaving school grounds, and given a "Georgic" (a punishment which involved copying 500 lines of Latin text).Elliott and Hanning, p. 32. Cameron passed 12 O-Levels and then studied three A-levels: History of art, History, in which he was taught by Michael Kidson, and Economics with Politics. He obtained three 'A' grades and a '1' grade in the Scholarship Level exam in Economics and Politics.Elliott and Hanning, pp. 45–6. The following autumn he passed the entrance exam for the University of Oxford, where he was offered an exhibition.Elliott and Hanning, p. 46.  After leaving Eton in 1984, Cameron started a nine-month gap year. He worked as a researcher for his godfather Tim Rathbone, then Conservative MP for Lewes. In his three months, he attended debates in the House of Commons.Elliott and Hanning, pp. 46–7. Through his father, he was then employed for a further three months in Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson as a 'ship jumper', an administrative post.Elliott and Hanning, pp. 47–8. Returning from Hong Kong, Cameron visited the then Soviet Union, where he was approached by two Russian men speaking fluent English. Cameron was later told by one of his professors that it was 'definitely an attempt' by the KGB to recruit him. Cameron began his Bachelor of Arts studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford."Brasenose alumnus becomes Prime Minister". Brasenose College. No date. Retrieved 2 January 2012. His tutor, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, described him as "one of the ablest" students he has taught, with "moderate and sensible Conservative" political views. Guy Spier, who shared tutorials with him, remembers him as an outstanding student: "We were doing our best to grasp basic economic concepts. David – there was nobody else who came even close. He would be integrating them with the way the British political system is put together. He could have lectured me on it, and I would have sat there and taken notes." When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil's ideas about a "Bill of Rights" to replace the Human Rights Act, however, Professor Bogdanor, himself a Liberal Democrat, said, "I think he is very confused. I've read his speech and it's filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding". While at Oxford, Cameron was a member of the student dining society, the Bullingdon Club, which has a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property.Foster, Patrick (28 January 2006)."How young Cameron wined and dined with the right sort". The Times (London). Retrieved 6 November 2006.  Cameron's period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in a Channel 4 docu-drama, When Boris Met Dave. Cameron graduated in 1988 with a first-class honours degree (MA). After graduation, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation, and he befriended fellow young colleagues including Edward Llewellyn, Ed Vaizey and Rachel Whetstone. They and others formed a group they called the "Smith Square set", which was dubbed the "Brat Pack" by the press, though it is better known as the "Notting Hill set", a name given to it pejoratively by Derek Conway. In 1991, Cameron was seconded to Downing Street to work on briefing John Major for his then bi-weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for "sharper&nbsp;... Despatch box performances" by Major,"Atticus", The Sunday Times, 30 June 1991 which included highlighting for Major "a dreadful piece of doublespeak" by Tony Blair (then the Labour Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national minimum wage."House of Commons 6th series, vol. 193, cols. 1133–34", Hansard. Retrieved 4 September 2007. He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow Judith Chaplin as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister."Diary", The Times, 14 August 1991. However, Cameron lost to Jonathan Hill, who was appointed in March 1992. Instead, Cameron was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the 1992 general election.Wood, Nicholas (13 March 1992). "New aide for Prime Minister". The Times (London). During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young "brat pack" of party strategists who worked between 12 and 20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of Alan Duncan in Gayfere Street, Westminster, which had been Major's campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership."Sleep little babies". The Times (London). 20 March 1992. Cameron headed the economic section; it was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with and befriended Steve Hilton, who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership.Wood, Nicholas (23 March 1992). "Strain starts to show on Major's round the clock 'brat pack'". The Times (London). The strain of getting up at 4:45&nbsp;am every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism."Campaign fall-out". The Times. 30 March 1992. The Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying "whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right," and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across Smith Square to jeer at Transport House, the former Labour headquarters.Pierce, Andrew (11 March 1992). "We got it right, say Patten's brat pack". The Sunday Times (London). Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont."Brats on the move". The Times (London). 14 April 1992. Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of Black Wednesday, when pressure from currency speculators forced the Pound sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference, Cameron had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, Patricia Morris, to contact him."Diary", The Times, 8 October 1992. Later that month Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the Christian Democratic Union; he was reported to be "still smarting" over the Bundesbank's contribution to the economic crisis."Peace-mongers". The Times (London). 20 October 1992. Lamont fell out with John Major after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to Conservative Campaign Headquarters for their political acceptability to be assessed.Hencke, David (8 February 1993). "Treasury tax review eyes fuel and children's clothes". The Guardian (London). By May 1993, the Conservatives' average poll rating dropped below 30%, where they would remain until the 1997 general election. Major and Lamont's personal ratings also declined dramatically. However, Lamont's unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron: he was considered as a potential "kamikaze" candidate for the Newbury by-election, which includes the area where he grew up.White, Michael; Wintour, Patrick (26 February 1993). "Points of Order". The Guardian (London). However, Cameron decided not to stand. During the by-election, Lamont gave the response "Je ne regrette rien" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see "the green shoots of recovery" or admitting to "singing in his bath" with happiness at leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself, even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been."Careless talk". The Times (London). 10 May 1993. Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.Smith, David; Prescott, Michael (30 May 1993). "Norman Lamont: the final days" (Focus). The Sunday Times (London).  After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the Treasury for less than a month before being specifically recruited by Home Secretary Michael Howard. It was commented that he was still "very much in favour""No score flaw". The Times (London). 22 June 1993. and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on.Grigg, John (2 October 1993). "Primed Minister". The Times (London). At the beginning of September 1993, Cameron applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates."Newbury's finest". The Times (London). 6 September 1993. Cameron was much more socially liberal than Howard but enjoyed working for him. According to Derek Lewis, then Director-General of Her Majesty's Prison Service, Cameron showed him a "his and hers list" of proposals made by Howard and his wife, Sandra. Lewis said that Sandra Howard's list included reducing the quality of prison food, although Sandra Howard denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was "uncomfortable" about the list.Leigh, David (23 February 1997). "Mrs Howard's own recipe for prison reform". The Observer (London). In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist Bruce Anderson wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase "balanced diet", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.Anderson, Bruce (1 March 1997). "Derek Lewis: Big job, little man, inaccurate book". The Spectator (London). During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the Press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the Prevention of Terrorism Act. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP Peter Mandelson demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.Wintour, Patrick (10 March 1994). "Smith fumes at untraced leak". The Guardian (London)."6th Series, vol. 239 col. 292", Hansard, 9 March 1994. Retrieved 4 September 2007. A senior Home Office civil servant noted the influence of Howard's Special Advisers, saying previous incumbents "would listen to the evidence before making a decision. Howard just talks to young public school gentlemen from the party headquarters." In July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications."Smallweed". The Guardian (London). 16 July 1994. Carlton, which had won the ITV franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film-distribution and video-producing arms. Cameron was suggested for the role to Carlton executive chairman Michael Green by his later mother-in-law Lady Astor. Cameron left Carlton to run for Parliament in 1997, returning to his job after his defeat. In 1997, Cameron played up the Company's prospects for digital terrestrial television, for which it joined with ITV Granada and Sky to form British Digital Broadcasting. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry."We can't wait any longer to map the digital mediascape". New Statesman (London). 3 April 1998. Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 in order to run for Parliament for a second time, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant.  Having been approved for the Candidates' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the 1997 general election. He was reported to have missed out on selection for Ashford in December 1994 after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays."Pendennis". The Observer (London). 1 January 1995. In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for Stafford, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority. The incumbent Conservative MP, Bill Cash, ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of Stone, where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going".Sherman, Jill (11 October 1996). "Clarke challenged to show gains of economic recovery". The Times (London). He also said the Party "should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements&nbsp;... It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion.""Conservative Party Conference 1996". BBC Archive. 10 October 1996 When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the single European currency clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.Travis, Alan (17 April 1997). "Rebels' seven-year march". The Guardian (London). Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national party line. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour Government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however, the Labour candidate, David Kidney, portrayed Cameron as "a right-wing Tory". Initially, Cameron thought he had a 50/50 chance but as the campaign wore on and the scale of the impending Conservative defeat grew, Cameron prepared himself for defeat. On election day, Stafford had a swing of 10.7%, almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: Kidney defeated Cameron by 24,606 votes (47.5%) to 20,292 (39.2%), a majority of 4,314 (8.3%).Elliott and Hanning (2007), pp.&nbsp;172–5. In the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the 2001 general election, Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried for the Kensington and Chelsea seat after the death of Alan Clark, but did not make the shortlist. He was in the final two but narrowly lost at Wealden in March 2000,White, Michael (14 March 2000). "Rightwingers and locals preferred for safe Tory seats". The Guardian (London). a loss ascribed by Samantha Cameron to his lack of spontaneity when speaking.Elliott and Hanning (2007), p. 193. On 4 April 2000 Cameron was selected as prospective candidate (PPC) for Witney in Oxfordshire. This had been a safe Conservative seat but its sitting MP Shaun Woodward (who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had "crossed the floor" to join the Labour Party and was selected instead for the safe Labour seat of St Helens South. Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe the two men as being "on fairly friendly terms".Elliott and Hanning (2007), p. 192. Cameron, advised in his strategy by friend Catherine Fall, put a great deal of effort into "nursing" his potential constituency, turning up at social functions, and attacking Woodward for changing his mind on fox hunting to support a ban."Why Shaun Woodward changed his mind" (Letter).

"Cameron push for more female MPs 'an insult to women'". The Independent (London).  The Conservatives had last won a general election in 1992. The general election of 2010 resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306). This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority and resulted in the nation's first hung parliament since February 1974. Talks between Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition.   On 11 May 2010, following the resignation of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister and on his recommendation, Elizabeth II invited Cameron to form a government. At age 43, Cameron became the youngest British Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool, who was appointed in 1812. In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats.  Cameron outlined how he intended to "put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest." As one of his first moves Cameron appointed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as Deputy Prime Minister on 11 May 2010. Between them, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats controlled 363 seats in the House of Commons, with a majority of 76 seats. On 2 June 2010, when Cameron took his first session of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) as Prime Minister, he began by offering his support and condolences to those affected by the shootings in Cumbria. In June 2010 Cameron described the economic situation as he came to power as "even worse than we thought" and warned of "difficult decisions" to be made over spending cuts. By the beginning of 2015 he was able to claim that his government's austerity programme had succeeded in halving the budget deficit, though critics described the claim as misleading since it was only true of the deficit measured as a percentage of GDP On 5 February 2011, Cameron criticised the failure of 'state multiculturalism', in his first speech as PM on radicalisation and the causes of terrorism. In July 2015, he outlined a five-year strategy to counter Islamist extremism and subversive teachings. Cameron agreed to holding the Scottish independence referendum, 2014 and eliminated the "devomax" option from the ballot for a straight out yes or no vote. He supported the successful Better Together campaign. He had also backed a successful campaign to retain the status quo in a referendum on changing the voting system held at the request of his coalition partners. He supported the introduction of gay marriage despite more of his own Conservative MPs voting against the move than for it, meaning the support of Lib Dem MPs in government and Labour MPs in opposition was required to allow it to pass. However, Cameron became the first prime minister in over 100 years to lose a foreign policy vote in the House of Commons in regards to the Syrian Civil War's Ghouta chemical attack.  On 7 May 2015, Cameron was re-elected Prime Minister with a majority in the Commons. The Conservative party's decisive win in the general election was as a surprise victory, as most polls and commentators predicted the outcome would be too close to call and result in a second hung parliament. Forming the first Conservative majority government since 1992, David Cameron became the first Prime Minister to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a larger popular vote share since 1900 and the only Prime Minister other than Margaret Thatcher to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a greater number of seats to-date. Cameron describes himself as a "modern compassionate conservative" and has spoken of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was "fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster".

Shortly after becoming Conservative leader, Cameron gave a speech to the 2006 Conservative Conference in Bournemouth in which he described the National Health Service as "one of the 20th Century's greatest achievements". He went on to say, "Tony Blair explained his priorities in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters: N.H.S." He also talked about his severely disabled son, concluding "So, for me, it is not just a question of saying the NHS is safe in my hands – of course it will be. My family is so often in the hands of the NHS, so I want them to be safe there."  Cameron has stated that he believes in "spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention" in cases such as the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. However, he says he is not a neo-conservative because, as a conservative, he recognizes "the complexities of human nature, and will always be skeptical of grand schemes to remake the world."In full: Cameron speech, BBC News Online, 4 October 2006, accessed 6 November 2006 He supports multilateralism stating "a country may act alone – but it cannot always succeed alone."

He believes that British Muslims have a duty to integrate into British culture, but noted in an article published in 2007 that the Muslim community finds aspects such as high divorce rates and drug use uninspiring, and that "Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around." In 2010 he appointed the first Muslim member of the British cabinet, Baroness Sayeeda Hussain Warsi, as a minister without portfolio, and in 2012 made her a special minister of state in foreign affairs. She resigned however in August 2014 over the government's handling of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. Whilst urging members of his party to support the Coalition's proposals for same-sex marriage, Cameron argued that he backed gay marriage not in spite of his conservatism but because he is a conservative, and claimed it was about equality.Green, Jessica (5 October 2011)."David Cameron urges Tories to back gay marriage". Pink News. Retrieved 28 December 2012. In 2012, Cameron publicly apologised for Thatcher-era policies on homosexuality, specifically the introduction of the controversial Section 28 laws in the 1980s, which he described as "a mistake", though he had previously voted against Section 28's full repeal. Cameron criticised Gordon Brown (when Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer) for being "an analogue politician in a digital age" and referred to him as "the roadblock to reform". He has also said that John Prescott "clearly looks a fool" in light of allegations of ministerial misconduct."Cameron: Prescott looks a 'fool'". BBC News. 2 May 2006. Retrieved 6 November 2006.

In 2006, Cameron made a speech in which he described extremist Islamic organisations and the British National Party as "mirror images" to each other, both preaching "creeds of pure hatred". Cameron is listed as being a supporter of Unite Against Fascism. Cameron in late 2009 urged the Lib Dems to join the Conservatives in a new "national movement" arguing there was "barely a cigarette paper" between them on a large number of issues. The invitation was rejected by the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, who attacked Cameron at the start of his party's annual conference in Bournemouth, saying that the Conservatives were totally different from his party and that the Lib Dems were the true "progressives" in UK politics. In September 2015, after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, Cameron called the party a "threat" to British national and economic security, on the basis of his defence and fiscal policies. While Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron has been accused of reliance on "old-boy networks", and conversely attacked by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of women and ethnic minority prospective parliamentary candidates. Two of most Cameron's senior appointments, that of George Osborne as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Boris Johnson as Conservative Party candidate for Mayor of London have been former members of the Bullingdon Club. However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of Standpoint, says that Cameron's Cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: "David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated — indeed the least Etonian — Conservative-led government this country has ever seen".Mosbacher, Michael (June 2013). "The Myth of Cameron's Eton 'Chumocracy'". Standpoint. Retrieved 8 May 2014. In a response to Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions in December 2009, Gordon Brown addressed the Conservative Party's inheritance tax policy, saying it "seems to have been dreamed up on the playing fields of Eton". This led to open discussion of "class war" by the mainstream media and leading politicians of both major parties, with speculation that the 2010 general election campaign would see the Labour Party highlight the backgrounds of senior Conservative politicians.  In 2006 Cameron described poverty as a "moral disgrace"Mulholland, Hélène (24 November 2006). "Cameron: poverty is a 'moral disgrace'". The Guardian (London). and promised to tackle relative poverty.Eaton, George (24 June 2015). "David Cameron has retreated from his promises on child poverty – but will it cost him?".

Child Poverty Action Group. n.d. in 2015 Polly Toynbee questioned Cameron's commitment to tackling poverty, contrasting his earlier statements agreeing that "poverty is relative" with proposals to change the government's poverty measure, and arguing that cuts in child tax credits would increase child poverty among low-paid working families.Toynbee, Polly (2 July 2015). "David Cameron abolishes poverty, just like that". The Guardian (London). In 2014 Cameron blocked £150 million European Union funding for UK food banks leading to criticism from Justin Welby, current Archbishop of Canterbury and others. Welby was shocked because hunger is unexpected in the UK and he called on Cameron to do more for hungry people.Gledhill, Ruth (9 December 2014). "Justin Welby issues challenge to David Cameron over food banks". Christian Today (London).Watt, Nicholas (17 December 2013). "Government under fire for rejecting European Union food bank funding".

Society, health and education editor for The Guardian, Patrick Butler"Patrick Butler". The Guardian (London). wrote, The government responded that in fact delays in benefit processing had been reduced, with the proportion of benefits paid on time rising from 88–89% under Labour, to 96–97% in 2014. 27 Anglican bishops together with leading Methodists and Quakers wrote to Cameron an open letter in which they accused Cameron of generating a crisis that drove 500,000 people to use food banks between Easter 2013 and February 2014. The letter stated However, the OECD found that people answering yes to the question ‘Have there been times in the past 12 months when you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?’ decreased from 9.8% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2012, leading some to say that the rise was due to both more awareness of food banks, and the government allowing Jobcentres to refer people to food banks when they were hungry (the previous Labour government had not allowed this). During the MPs expenses scandal in 2009, Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying "excessive" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:  One day later, The Daily Telegraph published figures showing over five years he had claimed £82,450 on his second home allowance.The Guardian (London) 2009 David Cameron claimed over £1,000 a month on second home Cameron repaid £680 claimed for repairs to his constituency home. Although he was not accused of breaking any rules, Cameron was placed on the defensive over mortgage interest expense claims covering his constituency home, after a report in the Mail on Sunday suggested he could have reduced the mortgage interest bill by putting an additional £75000 of his own money towards purchasing the home in Witney instead of paying off an earlier mortgage on his London home. Cameron argued that doing things differently would not have saved the taxpayer any money, as he was paying more on mortgage interest than he was able to reclaim as expenses anyway He also spoke out in favour of laws giving voters the power to "recall" or "sack" MPs accused of wrongdoing. He subsequently faced criticism for his handling of the expenses row surrounding Culture Secretary Maria Miller, when he rejected calls from fellow Conservative MPs to sack her from the front bench in 2014."David Cameron's handling of Maria Miller scandal losing party votes". The Daily Telegraph (London). 8 April 2014. At the launch of the Conservative Party's education manifesto in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the "brazenly elite" approach to education of countries such as Singapore and South Korea and expressed a desire to "elevate the status of teaching in our country". He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from "good" universities. Wes Streeting, then president of the National Union of Students, said "The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn't go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don't believe you're worth as much." Chris Keates, head of teaching union NASUWT, responded to the manifesto as a whole by saying that teachers would be left "shocked, dismayed and demoralised" and warned of the potential for strikes as a result. In April 2009, The Independent reported that in 1989, while Nelson Mandela remained imprisoned under the apartheid régime, David Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to sanctions against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip "jolly", saying that "it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The Botha regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence." Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP Peter Hain, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner. In an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 23 June 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said that he thought supporters should "see it through". He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru on 31 October 2006 calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011, he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. He has repeatedly called for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying “People want to know the truth"  Libya–United Kingdom relations soured in 2011 with the outbreak of the Libyan Civil War. Cameron condemned the "appalling and unacceptable" violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters. After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011 the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi rebels. Two days later the UK and the United States fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at targets in Libya. Cameron has said he is "proud" of the role United Kingdom played in the overthrow of Gaddafi's government."David Cameron's Libya statement in full". BBC News. 5 September 2011. Cameron also stated that UK had played "a very important role" in the military intervention and that Libya is not "going to be an enormous swamp of Islamists and extremists.""Libya intervention: British forces played key role, says Cameron". The Guardian (London). 2 September 2011. In August 2013, Cameron lost a motion in favour of bombing Syrian armed forces in response to the Ghouta chemical attack, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782. In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request of the Iraqi government, a bombing campaign against Islamic State (IS) targets in Iraq; the motion explicitly expressed parliament's disapproval of UK military action in Syria. Cameron promised that, before expanding UK air strikes to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval.  In July 2015, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by Reprieve revealed that, without the knowledge of UK parliamentarians, RAF pilots had, in fact, been bombing targets in Syria, and that Cameron knew of this. The prime minister, along with Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, faced strong criticism, including from Tory MPs, for not informing the Commons about this deployment; the Ministry of Defence argued that the pilots concerned were "embedded" with foreign military forces, and so were "effectively" operating as such, while Fallon denied that MPs had been, as he put it, "kept in the dark". The Reprieve FoI request also revealed that British drone pilots had been embedded, almost continuously, with American forces at Creech Air Force Base since 2008. These drone operators, who were "a gift of services", meaning the UK still paid their salaries and covered their expenses, had been carrying out operations that included reconnaissance in Syria to assist American strikes against IS. Fallon also argued that it is "illogical" for the UK not to bomb Isil in Syria as the organisation does not "differentiate between Syria and Iraq" and is "organised and directed and administered from Syria". Following the Isil bombings in Paris in November 2015, Cameron began pushing for a strategy for the Royal Air Force to bomb Syria in retaliation.BBC News In 2013, in response to Argentina's calls for negotiations over the Falkland Islands' sovereignty, a referendum was called asking Falkland Islanders whether they supported the continuation of their status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom.  With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory with only three votes against. In light of this Cameron said:  Cameron has been a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom; describing Indian&nbsp;– British relations as the "New Special Relationship" in 2010. In October 2012, as Narendra Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK rescinded its boycott of the then Gujarat state Chief Minister over religious riots in Gujarat in 2002 that left more than 2,000 dead, and in November 2013, Cameron commented that he was "open" to meeting Modi. Modi was later elected as Prime Minister in a landslide majority, leading to Cameron calling Modi and congratulating him on the "election success", one of the first Western leaders to do. Cameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War. "There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the Tamil minority in that country" Cameron stated. He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry. This followed a visit to Jaffna, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948. Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing missing relatives. In a speech in Ankara in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for Turkey's accession to the EU, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by "protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice". In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the Gaza flotilla raid and its Gaza policy, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a "prison camp", having previously referred to Gaza as "a giant open prison". These views were met with mixed reactions. The Cameron government does not formally recognized the Armenian massacres in Turkey as a "genocide". At the end of May 2011, Cameron stepped down as patron of the Jewish National Fund, becoming the first British prime minister not to be patron of the charity in the 110 years of its existence.  In a speech in 2011 Cameron said: "You have a Prime Minister whose commitment and determination to work for peace in Israel is deep and strong. Britain will continue to push for peace, but will always stand up for Israel against those who wish her harm". He said he wanted to reaffirm his "unshakable" belief in Israel within the same message. He also voiced his opposition to the Goldstone Report, claiming it had been biased against Israel and not enough blame had been placed on Hamas. In March 2014, during his first visit to Israel as Prime Minister, Cameron addressed Israel's Knesset in Jerusalem, where he offered his full support for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians, hoping a two-state solution might be achieved."Full text of British PM David Cameron's Knesset speech".

Cameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits. He said: "... in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax. The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great." In 2015, The Independent reported, "The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to last September – up from 210,000 in the previous year, and equal to the population of a city like Nottingham." During the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and cocaine recreationally before becoming an MP. Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to "err and stray" in their past."Cameron pressed on drugs question".

In 2014, Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a "first class-player in terms of defence" and no longer a "full partner" to the United States. In the July 2015 budget Chancellor George Osborne announced that the UK defence spending would meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP. Cameron has faced criticism over some of his very wealthy contacts who are associated with tax avoidance. However prosecutions for tax evasion during his time as prime minister rose from 420 in 2010/11 to 914 in 2013/14 and the number of convictions rose from 316 to 776. The tax gap fell from 7.0% of GDP in 2009/10 to 6.8% of GDP in 2013/14. After child tax credit were cut in the July 2015 budget Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper wrote in the New Statesman In January 2016, The Independent said there was an over 50% increase of the use of statutory instruments since 2010.  Lord Jopling deplored the behaviour which he called an abuse whilst Baroness Smith of Basildon asked whether it was the start of "constitutional gerrymandering." Daniel Finkelstein has said of the period leading up to Cameron's election as leader of the Conservative party that "a small group of us (myself, David Cameron, George Osborne, Michael Gove, Nick Boles, Nick Herbert I think, once or twice) used to meet up in the offices of Policy Exchange, eat pizza, and consider the future of the Conservative Party". Cameron's relationship with Osborne is regarded as particularly close; Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi has suggested the closeness of his relationship with David Cameron means the two effectively share power in the current government. Cameron co-operated with Dylan Jones, giving him interviews and access, to enable him to produce the book Cameron on Cameron. In the 2012 local elections, the Conservative Party's share of the vote fell from 35% to 31%, losing control of several councils including Plymouth, Southampton, Harlow, Redditch, Worcester and Great Yarmouth, after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls. Many Conservative MPs spoke out because of this, and Nadine Dorries warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.  Later that year, Brian Binley openly said that Cameron's leadership was like being a 'maid' to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013 it was revealed that Adam Afriyie was planning his own bid for the Tory leadership with the support of fellow MPs Mark Field, Bill Wiggin, Chris Heaton-Harris, Priti Patel, Jonathan Djanogly and Dan Byles. In the same month, The Times and ConservativeHome revealed that a 'rebel reserve' of 55 Tory MPs had given firm pledges to a coordinating MP to support a motion of 'no confidence' and write to Brady simultaneously, which would be enough MPs to trigger a vote of no confidence as the level of MPs needed to trigger such vote is 46. In 2007 Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, former editor of the News of the World, as his director of communications. Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to illegal phone hacking, although stating that he knew nothing about it. In June 2010 Downing Street confirmed Coulson's annual salary as £140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government."David Cameron's PR director Andy Coulson paid £140,000".

Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition Ed Miliband, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance. On 20 July, in a special parliamentary session at the House of Commons, arranged to discuss the News of the World phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he "regretted the furore" that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that "with hindsight" he would not have hired him. Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police on 30 May 2012. Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a "full and frank" apology for hiring him, saying "I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that." The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation. Although Lord Ashcroft played a significant role in the 2010 election, he wasn't offered a ministerial post. In June 2012, shortly before a major Tory rebellion on House of Lords reform, journalist Peter Oborne credited Ashcroft with "stopping the Coalition working" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right. According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites and a "brutal critic of the Coalition from the start", had established "megaphone presence" in the on-line media. He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by "coordinated attacks on the Coalition" and "the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together." In The Observer, Andrew Rawnsley commented that he believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to "generate publicity", "stir trouble for the prime minister" and influence the direction of the party. In 2015 Ashcroft released Call Me Dave, an unauthorised biography of Cameron written with journalist Isabel Oakeshott, which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as Piggate.  No evidence for the anecdote has been produced. Many commentators have described the accusations as a "revenge job" by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when Cameron came to power in 2010. Ashcroft initially claimed the book was "not about settling scores", while Oakeshott argued that they had held back publication until after the 2015 General Election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives' electoral chances. Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations "may have been case of mistaken identity” and has stated that he has a personal "beef" with Cameron.  Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft's reasons for writing the book were clear and the public could see clearly through it.  In the first month of Cameron's leadership, the Conservative Party's standing in opinion polls rose, with several pollsters placing it ahead of the ruling Labour Party. While the Conservative and Labour Parties drew even in early spring 2006, following the May 2006 local elections various polls once again generally showed Conservative leads."Current voting intention".

At the end of the year a series of polls showed improved support for the Conservatives giving them an 11-point lead over Labour. By May 2008, following the worst local election performance from the Labour Party in 40 years, the Conservative lead was up to 26 points, the largest since 1968. In late 2009, the Tory lead decreased and by January 2010 some polls were predicting a hung parliament, which was the eventual result.   A YouGov poll on party leaders conducted on 9–10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, whilst 38% thought he would be the best PM, 23% preferred Ed Miliband and 35% didn't know.The Party Leaders. YouGov. 14 June 2011. Until his veto on treaty changes to the European Union in December 2011 amid the Eurozone crisis, most opinion polls that year had shown a slim Labour lead. Many opinion polls showed that the majority of voters felt that Cameron made the right decision. Subsequent opinion polls have shown a narrow lead for the Conservatives ahead of Labour. In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought he was doing well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought he was doing badly.  In September 2015, a Opinium poll had similar results to the one shortly before the election, with voters split with 42% who approved of him and 41% who did not. Under their new leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour support continuing to lag behind that of the Conservatives. Cameron had significantly better net approval ratings in polls conducting in December and January (getting -6 in both) than Corbyn (who got -38 and -39).https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/mm8d71xdb9/InternalResults_160115_Corbyn_W.pdf Cameron is married to Samantha Gwendoline Sheffield, the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now Viscountess Astor). A Marlborough College school friend of Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha accepted Clare's invitation to accompany the Cameron family on holiday in Tuscany, Italy, after graduating from Bristol School of Creative Arts. It was then David and Samantha's romance started. They were wed on 1 June 1996 at the Church of St. Augustine of Canterbury, East Hendred, Oxfordshire, five years before he became an MP.  The Camerons have had four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: "The news hits you like a freight train&nbsp;... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he's wonderful."Can Boy Wonder save the Tories?". The Sunday Times (London). 9 October 2005. He was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after Ivan left it. Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.   The Camerons have two daughters, Nancy Gwen (born 2004) and Florence Rose Endellion (born 24 August 2010), and a son, Arthur Elwen (born 2006). Cameron took paternity leave when his second son was born, and this decision received broad coverage.  It was also stated that Cameron would be taking paternity leave after his second daughter was born. His second daughter was born on 24 August 2010, three weeks prematurely, while the family was on holiday in Cornwall. Her third given name, Endellion, is taken from the village of St Endellion near where the Camerons were holidaying. In early May 2008, the Camerons decided to enrol his daughter Nancy at a state school.

Cameron's constituency home is in Dean, Oxfordshire, and the Camerons are key members of the Chipping Norton set. On 8 September 2010, it was announced that Cameron would miss Prime Minister's Questions in order to fly to southern France to see his father, Ian Cameron, who had suffered a stroke with coronary complications. Later that day, with David and other family members at his bedside, Ian died. On 17 September 2010, Cameron attended a private ceremony for the funeral of his father in Berkshire, which prevented him from hearing the address of Pope Benedict XVI to Westminster Hall, an occasion he would otherwise have attended. In October 2010, David Cameron inherited £300,000 from his father's will, at that time it was just under the £325,000 threshold on which tax of 40 per cent is paid. The Camerons' family fortune was built up by his late father, Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in the City. Ian Cameron used multimillion-pound investment funds based in offshore tax havens, such as Jersey, Panama City, and Geneva, to increase the family wealth. In 1979 he took advantage of the end of capital controls made by Margaret Thatcher during her first month in power. The change in the law made it legal to take money out of the country without it being taxed or subject to any financial controls by the UK government. An estimate of his worth is , though this figure excludes the million-pound legacies Cameron is expected to inherit from both sides of his family.Shackle, Samira; Hegarty, Stephanie; Eaton, George (1 October 2009).

In early 2006, he was photographed cycling to work, followed by his driver in a car carrying his belongings. His Conservative Party spokesperson subsequently said that this was a regular arrangement for Cameron at the time. Cameron is an occasional jogger and in 2009 raised funds for charities by taking part in the Oxford 5K and the Great Brook Run."David Cameron runs in charity mud race". BBC News. 28 December 2009.

This 'brain fade' (as Cameron himself called his slip-up) received widespread Twitter coverage under the name '#villagate'. He is also a keen cricket fan and has appeared on Test Match Special. At a Q&A in August 2013 Cameron described himself as a practising Christian and an active member of the Church of England. On religious faith in general he has said: "I do think that organised religion can get things wrong but the Church of England and the other churches do play a very important role in society." He says he considers the Bible "a sort of handy guide" on morality. He views Britain as a "Christian country" and aims to put faith back into politics.         |-     |-    |-    |-  |-  |-     |-     |-     |-     |-        David Cameron Esq (1966–2001) David Cameron Esq MP (2001–2005) The Rt Hon David Cameron MP (2005–)  2012: Order of Abdulaziz al Saud Medal of Excellence David Cameron's articles at The Guardian David Cameron collected news and commentary at The Telegraph Brian Wheeler, The David Cameron story, BBC News, 6 December 2005 David Cameron official government website David Cameron official Conservative Party profile
