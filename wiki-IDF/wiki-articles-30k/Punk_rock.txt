 Punk rock (or simply punk) is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels. The term "punk" was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s, to describe garage bands and their devotees. By late 1976, bands such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Damned in London, and Television, Patti Smith, and the Ramones in New York City were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. Though originally more diverse and accepting, it evolved to create an "angry white male" punk stereotype with a "color blind" attitude.Nguyen, Mimi (1998). "It's (Not) a White World: Looking For Race In Punk", Punk Planet Issue 28. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, spike bands and other studded or spiked jewelry to bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies. By the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore (e.g. Black Flag) and Oi! (e.g. Cock Sparrer), as well as crossover thrash (e.g. Suicidal Tendencies), had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise to post-punk and the alternative rock movement. At the end of the 20th century, punk rock had been adopted by the mainstream, as pop punk and punk rock bands such as Green Day, Sublime, the Offspring and Blink-182 brought the genre widespread popularity.  The first wave of punk rock was aggressively modern, distancing itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock.Robb (2006), foreword by Michael Bracewell. According to Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone, "In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, what happens is that people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll."Ramone, Tommy, "Fight Club", Uncut, January 2007. John Holmstrom, founding editor of Punk magazine, recalls feeling "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [acts] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music."McLaren, Malcolm, "Punk Celebrates 30 Years of Subversion", BBC News, August 18, 2006. Retrieved on January 17, 2006. In critic Robert Christgau's description, "It was also a subculture that scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of hippie myth."Christgau, Robert, "Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk, by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain" (review), New York Times Book Review, 1996. Retrieved on January 17, 2007. Technical accessibility and a DIY spirit are prized in punk rock. In the early days of punk rock, this ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands.Rodel (2004), p. 237; Bennett (2001), pp. 49–50. Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was "rock and roll by people who didn't have very much skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music". In December 1976, the English fanzine Sideburns published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned "This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band".Savage (1992), pp. 280–281, including reproduction of the original image. Several sources incorrectly ascribe the illustration to the leading fanzine of the London punk scene, Sniffin' Glue (e.g., Wells [2004], p. 5; Sabin [1999], p. 111). Robb (2006) ascribes it to the Stranglers' in-house fanzine, Strangled (p. 311). In fact, Strangled, which only began appearing in 1977, evolved out of Sideburns (see, e.g., ) The title of a 1980 single by the New York punk band Stimulators, "Loud Fast Rules!" inscribed a catchphrase for punk's basic musical approach.Blush (2001), pp. 173, 175. See also The Stimulators—Loud Fast Rules 7″ Killed By Death Records (September 21, 2006). Some of British punk rock's leading figures made a show of rejecting not only contemporary mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with, but their own most celebrated predecessors: "No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977", declared the Clash song "1977".Harris (2004), p. 202. The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural "Year Zero".Reynolds (2005), p. 4. Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan "No Future"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England."Jeffries, Stuart. "A Right Royal Knees-Up". The Guardian. July 20, 2007. While "self-imposed alienation" was common among "drunk punks" and "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the "radical leftist utopianism"Washburne, Christopher, and Maiken Derno. Bad Music. Routledge, 2004. Page 247. of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer Joe Strummer's outlook, "Punk rock is meant to be our freedom. We're meant to be able to do what we want to do."Kosmo Vinyl, The Last Testament: The Making of London Calling (Sony Music, 2004). The issue of authenticity is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term "poseur" is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values and philosophy. Scholar Daniel S. Traber argues that "attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult"; as the punk scene matured, he observes, eventually "everyone got called a poseur".  Punk rock bands often emulate the bare musical structures and arrangements of 1960s garage rock.Murphy, Peter, "Shine On, The Lights Of The Bowery: The Blank Generation Revisited," Hot Press, July 12, 2002; Hoskyns, Barney, "Richard Hell: King Punk Remembers the [ ] Generation," Rock's Backpages, March 2002. Typical punk rock instrumentation includes one or two electric guitars, an electric bass, and a drum kit, along with vocals. Songs tend to be shorter than those of other popular genres. Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock 'n' roll verse-chorus form and 4/4 time signature. However, later bands have often broken from this format. In critic Steven Blush's description, "The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll ... like the craziest version of Chuck Berry. Hardcore was a radical departure from that. It wasn't verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form."Blush, Steven, "Move Over My Chemical Romance: The Dynamic Beginnings of US Punk," Uncut, January 2007. Punk rock vocals sometimes sound nasal,Wells (2004), p. 41; Reed (2005), p. 47. and lyrics are often shouted instead of sung in a conventional sense, particularly in hardcore styles.Shuker (2002), p. 159. Shifts in pitch, volume, or intonational style are relatively infrequent.Laing (1985), p. 58; Reynolds (2005), p. ix. Complicated guitar solos are considered self-indulgent and unnecessary, although basic guitar breaks are common.Chong, Kevin, "The Thrill Is Gone", Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, August 2006. Retrieved on December 17, 2006. Guitar parts tend to include highly distorted power chords or barre chords, creating a characteristic sound described by Christgau as a "buzzsaw drone".Quoted in Laing (1985), p. 62. Some punk rock bands take a surf rock approach with a lighter, twangier guitar tone. Others, such as Robert Quine, lead guitarist of the Voidoids, have employed a wild, "gonzo" attack, a style that stretches back through the Velvet Underground to the 1950s recordings of Ike Turner.Palmer (1992), p. 37. Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated; the quintessential approach is a relentless, repetitive "forced rhythm,"Laing (1985), p. 62. although some punk rock bass players—such as Mike Watt of the Minutemen and Firehose—emphasize more technical bass lines. Bassists often use a pick due to the rapid succession of notes, which makes fingerpicking impractical. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up. Compared to other forms of rock, syncopation is much less the rule.Laing (1985), pp. 61–63. Hardcore drumming tends to be especially fast. Production tends to be minimalistic, with tracks sometimes laid down on home tape recordersLaing (1985), pp. 118–19. or simple four-track portastudios. The typical objective is to have the recording sound unmanipulated and "real," reflecting the commitment and "authenticity" of a live performance.Laing (1985), p. 53.  Punk rock lyrics are typically frank and confrontational; compared to the lyrics of other popular music genres, they frequently comment on social and political issues.Sabin (1999), pp. 4, 226; Dalton, Stephen, "Revolution Rock," Vox, June 1993. See also Laing (1985), pp. 27–32, for a statistical comparison of lyrical themes. Trend-setting songs such as the Clash's "Career Opportunities" and Chelsea's "Right to Work" deal with unemployment and the grim realities of urban life.Laing (1985), p. 31. Especially in early British punk, a central goal was to outrage and shock the mainstream.Laing (1985), pp. 81, 125. The Sex Pistols'  "Anarchy in the U.K." and "God Save the Queen" openly disparaged the British political system and social mores. Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in "Love Comes in Spurts," written by Richard Hell and recorded by him with the Voidoids. Anomie, variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's "Blank Generation" and the bluntness of the Ramones' "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue," is a common theme. Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by V. Vale, founder of San Francisco fanzine Search and Destroy: "Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it that had never been done before by any generation in such a thorough way".Savage (1991), p. 440. See also Laing (1985), pp. 27–32. The classic punk rock look among male American musicians harkens back to the T-shirt, motorcycle jacket, and jeans ensemble favored by American greasers of the 1950s associated with the rockabilly scene and by British rockers of the 1960s. The cover of the Ramones' 1976 debut album, featuring a shot of the band by Punk photographer Roberta Bayley, set forth the basic elements of a style that was soon widely emulated by rock musicians both punk and nonpunk. Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look—and reputed invention of the safety-pin aesthetic—was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario Malcolm McLaren and, in turn, British punk style.Strongman (2008), pp. 58, 63, 64; Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 78. (John D Morton of Cleveland's Electric Eels may have been the first rock musician to wear a safety-pin-covered jacket.)See  McLaren's partner, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, credits Johnny Rotten as the first British punk to rip his shirt, and Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious as the first to use safety pins, although few of those following Punk could afford to buy McLaren and Westwood's designs so famously worn by the Pistols, so they made their own, diversifying the 'look' with various different styles based on these designs. Young women in punk demolished the typical female types in rock of either "coy sex kittens or wronged blues belters" in their fashion.Habell-Pallan, Michelle (2012). "Death to Racism and Punk Rock Revisionism", Pop: When the World Falls Apart: Music in the Shadow of Doubt. p. 247-270. Durham : Duke University Press. ISBN 9780822350996. Early female punk musicians displayed styles ranging from Siouxsie Sioux's bondage gear to Patti Smith's "straight-from-the-gutter androgyny".Strohm (2004), p. 188. The former proved much more influential on female fan styles.See, e.g., Laing (1985), "Picture Section," p. 18. Over time, tattoos, piercings, and metal-studded and -spiked accessories became increasingly common elements of punk fashion among both musicians and fans, a "style of adornment calculated to disturb and outrage".Wojcik (1997), p. 122. Among the other facets of the Punk Rock scene, a punks hair is an important way of showing their freedom of expression." The typical male punk haircut was originally short and choppy; the Mohawk later emerged as a characteristic style.Wojcik (1995), pp. 16–19; Laing (1985), p. 109. Along with the mohawk, long spikes have been associated with the punk rock genre.  The characteristic stage performance style of male punk musicians does not deviate significantly from the macho postures classically associated with rock music.Laing (1985), pp. 89, 97–98, 125. Female punk musicians broke more clearly from earlier styles. Scholar John Strohm suggests that they did so by creating personas of a type conventionally seen as masculine: "They adopted a tough, unladylike pose that borrowed more from the macho swagger of sixties garage bands than from the calculated bad-girl image of bands like the Runaways." Scholar Dave Laing describes how bassist Gaye Advert adopted fashion elements associated with male musicians only to generate a stage persona readily consumed as "sexy".Laing (1985), p. 92, 88. Laing focuses on more innovative and challenging performance styles, seen in the various erotically destabilizing approaches of Siouxsie Sioux, the Slits' Ari Up, and X-Ray Spex' Poly Styrene.Laing (1985), pp. 89, 92–93. The lack of emphatic syncopation led punk dance to "deviant" forms. The characteristic style was originally the pogo.Laing (1985), pp. 34, 61, 63, 89–91. Sid Vicious, before he became the Sex Pistols' bassist, is credited with initiating the pogo in Britain as an attendee at one of their concerts.Laing (1985), p. 90; Robb (2006), pp. 159–60. Moshing (Slam Dancing) is typical at hardcore shows. The lack of conventional dance rhythms was a central factor in limiting punk's mainstream commercial impact.Laing (1985), p. 34. Breaking down the distance between performer and audience is central to the punk ethic.Laing (1985), p. 82. Fan participation at concerts is thus important; during the movement's first heyday, it was often provoked in an adversarial manner—apparently perverse, but appropriately "punk". First-wave British punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Damned insulted and otherwise goaded the audience into intense reactions. Laing has identified three primary forms of audience physical response to goading: can throwing, stage invasion, and spitting or "gobbing".Laing (1985), pp. 84–85. In the hardcore realm, stage invasion is often a prelude to stage diving. In addition to the numerous fans who have started or joined punk bands, audience members also become important participants via the scene's many amateur periodicals—in England, according to Laing, punk "was the first musical genre to spawn fanzines in any significant numbers".Laing (1985), p. 14. In the early to mid-1960s, garage rock bands, often recognized as punk rock's progenitors, began springing up around North America. The Kingsmen, from Portland, Oregon, had a hit with their 1963 cover of "Louie, Louie," considered by some as punk rock's defining "ur-text." The iconic song actually has Latino roots, as its original composer Richard Berry wrote the song after being exposed to and influenced by Latin Jazz.Avant-Mier, Roberto (2008). Rock the Nation: Latin/o Identities and the Latin Rock Diaspora,  p. 99. Routledge, London. ISBN 1441164480. After the Beatles' first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, and then with the subsequent string of other successful British acts, the garage band craze would gather even more momentum. The minimalist sound of many garage rock bands was influenced by the harder-edged wing of the British Invasion, exemplified by groups such as the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. After 1967, U.S. garage rock began to fall out of favor, but the raw sound and outsider attitude of bands, such as the Sonics, the Seeds, the Remains, the Standells, and the Shadows of Knight predicted the style of later bands such as MC5 and the Stooges.  In the early 1970s, certain rock critics began to speak of the mid-1960s garage bands (as well bands that they considered continuing in their line, such as MC5 and the Stooges) as a genre that they called "punk rock."Bangs, Lester. Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung. Anchor Books, a division of Random House. 2003. pg. 8, 56, 57, 61, 64, 101: reprints of articles which appeared in 1971 and 1972, that refer to garage bands such as the Count Five and the Troggs as "punk";  pg. 101 associates "Iggy" and "Jonathan of Modern Lovers" with the Troggs and their ilk (as being punk); pg. 112–113 speak of the Guess Who as "punk"—the Guess Who had made recordings (i.e. their hit version of Shakin' All Over," 1965) as a garage rock outfit in the mid-1960s; pg. 8 makes a general statement about "punk rock" (garage) as a genre: "... then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever."; pg. 225 is a reprint from article which appeared in late-70s, that refers back to garage bands as "punk"Laing, Dave. One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock. PM Press. Oakland, CA 2015. pg. 22–23. Laing writes that the term, "punk rock" was used "generically" (i.e. as to designate a genre) in the early 70s to describe mid-1960s garage rock bands—he quotes Greg Shaw from the late 70s referring to how it was used in the early 70s to designate the genre: "Punk rock in those days was a quaint fanzine term for a transient form of mid-60s music ..."  Pg. 21 recognizes a "strand" of punk that started long before the mid 70s, but this view is not intended to be late-70s "retrospectivism," but rather, based on testimony from early 70s critics, as the next two pages emphasize. Pg. 23 emphasizes that the development of the punk "aesthetic" started with the early 70s critics (although the actual subculture would not manifest until the mid 70s).[ ]  However, since the advent of New York and London scenes of 1975-1978, and the subculture that grew out of them, the term has become most commonly applied to music emerging after 1974.  Sixties garage bands are now typically described as garage rock, or, especially in the case of their immediate successors, protopunk.G. Thompson, American Culture in the 1980s (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), ISBN 0-7486-1910-0, p. 134. From England in 1964, largely under the grip of the mod youth movement and beat group explosion, came the Kinks' hit singles, "You Really Got Me" and "All Day and All of the Night," both influenced by "Louie, Louie".Kitts, Thomas M. Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else. Routledge. 2007. Pg. 41 They have been described as "predecessors of the whole three-chord genre." For instance, the Ramones' 1978 'I Don't Want You,' was largely Kink's-influenced.Harrington (2002), p. 165. In 1965, the Who progressed from their first single, "I Can't Explain," a virtual Kinks clone, to "My Generation". Though it had little impact on the American charts, the Who's mod anthem pre-figured the kind of "cerebral mix of musical ferocity and rebellious posture"Reed (2005), p. 49. that would characterize much of the later British punk rock of the 1970s. John Reed describes the Clash's emergence as a "tight ball of energy with both an image and rhetoric reminiscent of a young Pete Townshend—speed obsession, pop-art clothing, art school ambition." The Who and fellow mods the Small Faces were among the few rock elders acknowledged by the Sex Pistols.Fletcher (2000), p. 497.  The tougher-sounding British bands of the mid-late 60s are sometimes referred to as Freakbeat.  Debut albums by two Michigan-based bands that appeared in 1969 are regarded as the central protopunk records. In January, Detroit's MC5 released Kick Out the Jams. "Musically the group is intentionally crude and aggressively raw," wrote critic Lester Bangs in Rolling Stone. "Most of the songs are barely distinguishable from each other in their primitive two-chord structures. You've heard all this before from such notables as the Seeds, Blue Cheer, Question Mark and the Mysterians, and the Kingsmen."MC5: Kick Out the Jams review by Lester Bangs, Rolling Stone, April 5, 1969. Retrieved on January 16, 2007.  Los Saicos out of Peru recorded one of the earliest proto-punk tracks, 1965's "Demolicion" According to the Black Lips, who cited the Peruvian band as inspiration: "They are the first to play what later became punk. There was no name for that at the time, but the riffs are definitely punk."  That August, the Stooges, from Ann Arbor, premiered with a self-titled album. According to critic Greil Marcus, the band, led by singer Iggy Pop, created "the sound of Chuck Berry's Airmobile—after thieves stripped it for parts".Marcus (1979), p. 294. The album was produced by John Cale, a former member of New York's experimental rock group the Velvet Underground. Having earned a "reputation as the first underground rock band," the Velvet Underground inspired, directly or indirectly, many of those involved in the creation of punk rock.Taylor (2003), p. 49. In the early 1970s, the New York Dolls updated the original wildness of 1950's rock 'n' roll in a fashion that later became known as glam punk.Harrington (2002), p. 538. The New York duo Suicide played spare, experimental music with a confrontational stage act inspired by that of the Stooges. At the Coventry club in the New York City borough of Queens, the Dictators used rock as a vehicle for wise-ass attitude and humor.Bessman (1993), pp. 9–10. In Boston, the Modern Lovers, led by Velvet Underground devotee Jonathan Richman, gained attention with a minimalistic style. In 1974, an updated garage rock scene began to coalesce around the newly opened Rathskeller club in Kenmore Square. Among the leading acts were the Real Kids, founded by former Modern Lover John Felice; Willie Alexander and the Boom Boom Band, whose frontman had been a member of the Velvet Underground for a few months in 1971; and Mickey Clean and the Mezz.Andersen and Jenkins (2001), p. 12.    In 1974, as well, the Detroit band Death—made up of three African-American brothers—recorded "scorching blasts of feral ur-punk," but couldn't arrange a release deal. In Ohio, a small but influential underground rock scene emerged, led by Devo in Akron and Kent and by Cleveland's Electric Eels, Mirrors and Rocket from the Tombs. In 1975, Rocket from the Tombs split into Pere Ubu and Frankenstein. The Electric Eels and Mirrors both broke up, and the Styrenes emerged from the fallout.Klimek, Jamie, "Mirrors", Jilmar Music; Jäger, Rolf, "Styrenes—A Brief History", Rent a Dog. Both retrieved on November 27, 2007. Britain's Deviants, in the late 1960s, played in a range of psychedelic styles with a satiric, anarchic edge and a penchant for situationist-style spectacle presaging the Sex Pistols by almost a decade. In 1970, the act evolved into the Pink Fairies, which carried on in a similar vein.Unterberger (1998), pp. 86–91. With his Ziggy Stardust persona, David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central—elements, again, that were picked up by the Sex Pistols and certain other punk acts.Laing (1985), pp. 24–26. The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie's presentation concepts, while moving musically in the direction that would become identified with punk. Bands in London's pub rock scene stripped the music back to its basics, playing hard, R&B-influenced rock 'n' roll. By 1974, the scene's top act, Dr. Feelgood, was paving the way for others such as the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer that would play a role in the punk explosion. Among the pub rock bands that formed that year was the 101ers, whose lead singer would soon adopt the name Joe Strummer.Robb (2006), p. 51. Bands anticipating the forthcoming movement were appearing as far afield as Düsseldorf, West Germany, where "punk before punk" band NEU! formed in 1971, building on the Krautrock tradition of groups such as Can. In Japan, the anti-establishment Zunō Keisatsu (Brain Police) mixed garage psych and folk. The combo regularly faced censorship challenges, their live act at least once including onstage masturbation.Anderson (2002), p. 588. A new generation of Australian garage rock bands, inspired mainly by the Stooges and MC5, was coming even closer to the sound that would soon be called "punk": In Brisbane, the Saints also recalled the raw live sound of the British Pretty Things, who had made a notorious tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1975.Unterberger (2000), p. 18. Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries, punk was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute; William Shakespeare used it with that meaning in The Merry Wives of Windsor (1602) and Measure for Measure (1623).Dickson (1982), p. 230. The term eventually came to describe "a young male hustler, a gangster, a hoodlum, or a ruffian".Leblanc (1999), p. 35. As Legs McNeil explains, "On TV, if you watched cop shows, Kojak, Baretta, when the cops finally catch the mass murderer, they'd say, 'you dirty Punk.' It was what your teachers would call you. It meant that you were the lowest."Quoted in Leblanc (1999), p. 35. The first known use of the phrase punk rock appeared in the Chicago Tribune on March 22, 1970, attributed to Ed Sanders, cofounder of New York's anarcho-prankster band the Fugs. Sanders was quoted describing a solo album of his as "punk rock—redneck sentimentality".Shapiro (2006), p. 492. In the December 1970 issue of Creem, Lester Bangs, mocking more mainstream rock musicians, ironically referred to Iggy Pop as "that Stooge punk".Bangs, Lester, "Of Pop and Pies and Fun", Creem, December 1970. Retrieved on November 29, 2007. Suicide's Alan Vega credits this usage with inspiring his duo to bill its gigs as a "punk mass" for the next couple of years.Nobahkt (2004), p. 38.  Dave Marsh was the first music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he described ? and the Mysterians, one of the most popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a "landmark exposition of punk rock".Shapiro (2006), p. 492. Note that Taylor (2003) misidentifies the year of publication as 1970 (p. 16). Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about "what I have chosen to call "punkrock" bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)".Gendron (2002), p. 348 n. 13. Robert Christgau writing for the Village Voice in October, 1971 refers to "mid-60s punk" as a historical period of rock-and-roll.Christgau, Robert (1971). [ ] Consumer Guide (20). Retrieved 13 September 2013. Lester Bangs would use the term "punk rock" in several articles written in the early 70s to refer to mid-60s garage acts. In his June, 1971 piece in Creem, "Psyhotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," he wrote, "then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter. ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever."Bangs, Lester.

Taken from article, '"Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," which appeared in June 1971 edition of Creem—refers to garage bands such as the Count Five as "punk rock"  In several places in a 1971 article in Who Put the Bomp, Bangs refers to Britain's the Troggs and bands of their ilk as "punk."Bangs, Lester.

In June 1972, the fanzine Flash included a "Punk Top Ten" of 1960s albums.Taylor (2003), p. 16.  By that December, the term was in circulation to the extent that The New Yorkers Ellen Willis, contrasting her own tastes with those of Flash and fellow critic Nick Tosches, wrote, "Punk-rock has become the favored term of endearment."Willis, Ellen, "Into the Seventies, for Real," The New Yorker, December 1972; reprinted in Willis's Out of the Vinyl Deeps (2001, University of Minneapolis Press), pp. 114–16.

In the liner notes of the 1972 anthology LP, Nuggets, musician and rock journalist Lenny Kaye, later a member of the Patti Smith Group, used variations of the term in two places: first "punk rock," in the essay liner notes, to describe the genre of 60s garage bands, and then, later, "classic garage-punk," in the track-by-track notes, to describe a song recorded in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight.Kaye, Lenny. Original liner notes for Nuggets LP. (Elektra, 1972): first he uses the term "punk rock" to describe genre of 60s garage bands: "The name that has been unofficially coined for them—"punk rock"—seems particularly fitting in this case..." then later, in the track-by-track notes, he uses the term, "garage punk" to describe a song by the Shadows of Knight as "classic garage punk"Houghton, Mick, "White Punks on Coke," Let It Rock. December 1975.  In the January 1973 Rolling Stone review of Nuggets, Greg Shaw commented "Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the '60s to the original rockabilly spirit of Rock 'n Roll&nbsp;..."  In February 1973, Terry Atkinson of the Los Angeles Times, reviewing the debut album by a hard rock band, Aerosmith, declared that it "achieves all that punk-rock bands strive for but most miss."Atkinson, Terry, "Hits and Misses", Los Angeles Times, February 17, 1973, p. B6. Three months later, Billy Altman launched the short-lived punk magazine, which pre-dated the better-known 1975 publication of the same name, but, unlike the later magazine, was more devoted to covering 60s garage and psychedelic acts.Laing (1985), p. 13; "Punk Magazine Listening Party # 7", Punk Magazine, July 20, 2001.

He mentions that much "punk" fanfare in early 70s was in relation to mid-60s garage rock and artists perceived as following in that tradition.

"Blue Cheer More Pumice than Lava." punk magazine. Fall 1973. In this punk magazine article Saunders discusses Randy Holden, former member of garage rock acts the Other Half and the Sons of Adam, then later protopunk/heavy rock band, Blue Cheer. He refers to an album by the Other Half as "acid punk." In May 1974, Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn reviewed the second New York Dolls album, Too Much Too Soon. "I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing," he wrote, describing the album as "perhaps the best example of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street."Hilburn, Robert, "Touch of Stones in Dolls' Album," Los Angeles Times, May 7, 1974, p. C12. Bassist Jeff Jensen of Boston's Real Kids reports of a show that year, "A reviewer for one of the free entertainment magazines of the time caught the act and gave us a great review, calling us a 'punk band.'&nbsp;... [W]e all sort of looked at each other and said, 'What's punk?'"Harvard, Joe, "Real Kids", Boston Rock Storybook. Retrieved on November 27, 2007.  By 1975, punk was being used to describe acts as diverse as the Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen.Savage (1991), p. 131. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement "street rock"; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk "to describe what was going on at CBGBs".Savage (1991), pp. 130–131. Holmstrom, McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine Punk, which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term.Taylor (2003), pp. 16–17. "It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular", Holmstrom later remarked. "We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it. We wanted to get rid of the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. We wanted the fun and liveliness back."  The origins of New York's punk rock scene can be traced back to such sources as late 1960s trash culture and an early 1970s underground rock movement centered on the Mercer Arts Center in Greenwich Village, where the New York Dolls performed.Savage (1991), pp. 86–90, 59–60. In early 1974, a new scene began to develop around the CBGB club, also in lower Manhattan. At its core was Television, described by critic John Walker as "the ultimate garage band with pretensions".Walker (1991), p. 662. Their influences ranged from the Velvet Underground to the staccato guitar work of Dr. Feelgood's Wilko Johnson.Strongman (2008), pp. 53, 54, 56. The band's bassist/singer, Richard Hell, created a look with cropped, ragged hair, ripped T-shirts, and black leather jackets credited as the basis for punk rock visual style.Savage (1992), p. 89. In April 1974, Patti Smith, a member of the Mercer Arts Center crowd and a friend of Hell's, came to CBGB for the first time to see the band perform.Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 102. A veteran of independent theater and performance poetry, Smith was developing an intellectual, feminist take on rock 'n' roll. On June 5, she recorded the single "Hey Joe"/"Piss Factory", featuring Television guitarist Tom Verlaine; released on her own Mer Records label, it heralded the scene's do it yourself (DIY) ethic and has often been cited as the first punk rock record. Strongman (2008), p. 57; Savage (1991), p. 91; Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 511; Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 106. By August, Smith and Television were gigging together at another downtown New York club, Max's Kansas City.  Out in Forest Hills, Queens, several miles from lower Manhattan, the members of a newly formed band adopted a common surname. Drawing on sources ranging from the Stooges to the Beatles and the Beach Boys to Herman's Hermits and 1960s girl groups, the Ramones condensed rock 'n' roll to its primal level: "'1-2-3-4!' bass-player Dee Dee Ramone shouted at the start of every song, as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm."Savage (1991), pp. 90–91. The band played its first gig at CBGB on August 16, 1974, on the same bill as another new act, Angel and the Snake, soon to be renamed Blondie.Gimarc (2005), p. 14. By the end of the year, the Ramones had performed seventy-four shows, each about seventeen minutes long.Bessman (1993), p. 27. "When I first saw the Ramones", critic Mary Harron later remembered, "I couldn't believe people were doing this. The dumb brattiness."Savage (1991), pp. 132–33. The Dictators, with a similar "playing dumb" concept, were recording their debut album. The Dictators' Go Girl Crazy! came out in March 1975, mixing absurdist originals such as "Master Race Rock" and loud, straight-faced covers of cheese pop like Sonny & Cher's "I Got You Babe". That spring, Smith and Television shared a two-month-long weekend residency at CBGB that significantly raised the club's profile.Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 119. The Television sets included Richard Hell's "Blank Generation", which became the scene's emblematic anthem.Savage (1992) claims that "Blank Generation" was written around this time (p. 90). However, the Richard Hell anthology album Spurts includes a live Television recording of the song that he dates "spring 1974." Soon after, Hell left Television and founded a band featuring a more stripped-down sound, the Heartbreakers, with former New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan. The pairing of Hell and Thunders, in one critical assessment, "inject[ed] a poetic intelligence into mindless self-destruction". A July festival at CBGB featuring over thirty new groups brought the scene its first substantial media coverage.Strongman (2008), p. 96; Savage (1992), p. 130. In August, Television—with Fred Smith, former Blondie bassist, replacing Hell—recorded a single, "Little Johnny Jewel", for the tiny Ork label. In the words of John Walker, the record was "a turning point for the whole New York scene" if not quite for the punk rock sound itself—Hell's departure had left the band "significantly reduced in fringe aggression".  Other bands were becoming regulars at CBGB, such as Mink DeVille and Talking Heads, which moved down from Rhode Island. More closely associated with Max's Kansas City were Suicide and the band led by Jayne County, another Mercer Arts Center alumna. The first album to come out of this downtown scene was released in November 1975: Smith's debut, Horses, produced by John Cale for the major Arista label.Walsh (2006), p. 27. The inaugural issue of Punk appeared in December.Savage (1991), p. 132. The new magazine tied together earlier artists such as Velvet Underground lead singer Lou Reed, the Stooges, and the New York Dolls with the editors' favorite band, the Dictators, and the array of new acts centered on CBGB and Max's.Walsh (2006), pp. 15, 24; for Punk, Wayne County, and punk homosexuality, see McNeil and McCain (2006), pp. 272–75; Savage (1992), p. 139; for CBGB's closing in 2006, see, e.g., Damian Fowler, "Legendary punk club CBGB closes", BBC News, October 16, 2006. Retrieved on December 11, 2006. That winter, Pere Ubu came in from Cleveland and played at both spots.Savage (1992), p. 137. Early in 1976, Hell left the Heartbreakers; he soon formed a new group that would become known as the Voidoids, "one of the most harshly uncompromising bands" on the scene.Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 249. That April, the Ramones' debut album was released by Sire Records; the first single was "Blitzkrieg Bop", opening with the rally cry "Hey! Ho! Let's go!" According to a later description, "Like all cultural watersheds, Ramones was embraced by a discerning few and slagged off as a bad joke by the uncomprehending majority." At the instigation of Ramones lead singer Joey Ramone, the members of Cleveland's Frankenstein moved east to join the New York scene. Reconstituted as the Dead Boys, they played their first CBGB gig in late July.Adams (2002), p. 369; McNeil and McCain (2006), pp. 233–34. In August, Ork put out an EP recorded by Hell with his new band that included the first released version of "Blank Generation". Buckley (2003), p. 485. Other New York venues apart from CBGB included the Lismar Lounge (41 First Avenue) and Aztec Lounge (9th Street).New York, Volume 20, Page 67 1987 "Lismar Lounge (41 First Avenue, near 3rd Street). The Love Club is no more (it operated in the basement till a month ago). ... When people talk about the punk scene at CBGB, they mean the Sunday matinee performances. For $5 ... Aztec Lounge This is only partly punk—the bar crowd is actually friendly." The term punk initially referred to the scene in general, rather than a particular sound—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.Walsh (2006), p. 8.  Chickasha, Oklahoma gave birth to avant garde, glam-punk bands Victoria Vein and the Thunderpunks in 1974 and Debris' in 1975 whose self-released underground classic Static Disposal was released in 1976. The album has been touted as an inspiration by numerous bands including Scream, Nurse With Wound, the Melvins and Sonic Youth.Oklahoma RockAnother Hot Oklahoma Night BlogBrady, Karen Chickasha Express Star(2010) In 1975, the Suicide Commandos formed in Minneapolis. They were one of the first U.S. bands outside of New York to play in the Ramones-style harder-louder-faster mode that would define punk rock.Unterberger (1999), p. 319. Detroit's Death self-released one of their 1974 recordings, "Politicians in My Eyes", in 1976. As the punk movement expanded rapidly in the United Kingdom that year, a few bands with similar tastes and attitude appeared around the United States. The first West Coast punk scenes emerged in San Francisco, with the bands Crime and the Nuns,Unterberger (1999), p. 426. and Seattle, where the Telepaths, Meyce, and the Tupperwares played a groundbreaking show on May 1.Humphrey, Clark.

Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, performer Alice Bag formed the punk music group The Bags in 1977. Alice influenced the Hollywood punk scene by incorporating Mexican and Chicano musical culture into her music through canción ranchera—which translates to "country song" and is associated with mariachi ensembles—as well as estilo bravío, a wild style of performance often seen in punk.Habell-Pallán, Michelle (2012).

Around the turn of the year, White Boy began giving notoriously crazed performances.Andersen and Jenkins (2001), pp. 2–13. In Boston, the scene at the Rathskeller—affectionately known as the Rat—was also turning toward punk, though the defining sound retained a distinct garage rock orientation. Among the city's first new acts to be identified with punk rock was DMZ.  In Bloomington, Indiana, the Gizmos played in a jokey, raunchy, Dictators-inspired style later referred to as "frat punk".  Like their garage rock predecessors, these local scenes were facilitated by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's do it yourself ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success, as well as a desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy.Ross, Alex. "Generation Exit", The New Yorker, April 25, 1994, pp. 102–104. As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY.Harvard, Joe, "Willie "Loco" Alexander and the Boom Boom Band", Boston Rock Storybook. Retrieved November 27, 2007.   At the same time, a similar music-based subculture was beginning to take shape in various parts of Australia. A scene was developing around Radio Birdman and its main performance venue, the Oxford Tavern (later the Oxford Funhouse), located in Sydney's Darlinghurst suburb. In December 1975, the group won the RAM (Rock Australia Magazine)/Levi's Punk Band Thriller competition.Buckley (2003), p. 3; McFarlane (1999), p. 507. By 1976, the Saints were hiring Brisbane local halls to use as venues, or playing in "Club 76", their shared house in the inner suburb of Petrie Terrace. The band soon discovered that musicians were exploring similar paths in other parts of the world. Ed Kuepper, co-founder of the Saints, later recalled:  One thing I remember having had a really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it [in 1976], I mean it was a great record&nbsp;... but I hated it because I knew we’d been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used&nbsp;... and I thought, "Fuck. We’re going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.Walker, Clinton (1996), p. 20.  On the other side of Australia, in Perth, germinal punk rock act the Cheap Nasties, featuring singer-guitarist Kim Salmon, formed in August.McFarlane (1999), p. 548. In September 1976, the Saints became the first punk rock band outside the U.S. to release a recording, the single "(I'm) Stranded". As with Patti Smith's debut, the band self-financed, packaged, and distributed the single."Great Australian Albums&nbsp;[TV review]"&nbsp; "Great Australian Albums The Saints – (I'm) Stranded&nbsp;[DVD review]"&nbsp; "(I'm) Stranded" had limited impact at home, but the British music press recognized it as a groundbreaking record.Stafford (2006), pp. 57–76. At the insistence of their superiors in the UK, EMI Australia signed the Saints. Meanwhile, Radio Birdman came out with a self-financed EP, Burn My Eye, in October.McFarlane (1999), p. 507. Trouser Press critic Ian McCaleb later described the record as the "archetype for the musical explosion that was about to occur".McCaleb (1991), p. 529.  By 1975 the movement was already well established in London and had been growing for a number of years, with non-gigging and recording bands like The Flowers of Romance who went on to gain near mythical status. Inspired by music from The Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop and early David Bowie at one point the band featured Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni and Viv Albertine, who later joined The Slits. Following a brief period unofficially managing the New York Dolls, Briton Malcolm McLaren returned to London in May 1975, inspired by the new scene he had witnessed at CBGB. The Kings Road clothing store he co-owned, recently renamed Sex, was building a reputation with its outrageous "anti-fashion"."The Sex Pistols", Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock 'n' Roll (2001).

In August, the group was seeking a new lead singer. Another Sex habitué, Johnny Rotten, auditioned for and won the job. Adopting a new name, the group played its first gig as the Sex Pistols on November 6, 1975, at Saint Martin's School of ArtGimarc (2005), p. 22; Robb (2006), p. 114; Savage (1992), p. 129. and soon attracted a small but ardent following."The Bromley Contingent", punk77.co.uk. Retrieved on December 3, 2006. In February 1976, the band received its first significant press coverage; guitarist Steve Jones declared that the Sex Pistols were not so much into music as they were "chaos".Savage (1992), pp. 151–152. The quote has been incorrectly ascribed to McLaren (e.g., Laing [1985], pp. 97, 127) and Rotten (e.g., "Punk Music in Britain", BBC, October 7, 2002), but Savage directly cites the New Musical Express issue in which the quote originally appeared. Robb (2006), p. 148, also describes the NME article in some detail and ascribes the quote to Jones. The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, "Bet you don't hate us as much as we hate you!"Quoted in Friedlander and Miller (2006), p. 252. McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, "hard and tough".Quoted in Savage (1992), p. 163. As described by critic Jon Savage, the band members "embodied an attitude into which McLaren fed a new set of references: late-sixties radical politics, sexual fetish material, pop history,...youth sociology".Savage (1992), p. 163. Bernard Rhodes, a sometime associate of McLaren and friend of the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers.Savage (1992), pp. 124, 171, 172. On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in what came to be regarded as one of the most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths. In July, the Ramones crossed the Atlantic for two London shows that helped spark the nascent UK punk scene and affected its musical style—"instantly nearly every band speeded up".Taylor (2003), p. 56; McNeil and McCain (2006), pp. 230–233; Robb (2006), pp. 198, 201. Quote: Robb (2006), p. 198. On July 4, they played with the Flamin' Groovies and the Stranglers before a crowd of 2,000 at the Roundhouse.Robb (2006), p. 198. That same night, the Clash debuted, opening for the Sex Pistols in Sheffield. On July 5, members of both bands attended a Ramones gig at Dingwalls club.Taylor (2003), p. 56. The following night, the Damned performed their first show, as the Sex Pistols opening act in London. In critic Kurt Loder's description, the Sex Pistols purveyed a "calculated, arty nihilism, [while] the Clash were unabashed idealists, proponents of a radical left-wing social critique of a sort that reached back at least to&nbsp;... Woody Guthrie in the 1940s". The Damned built a reputation as "punk's party boys".Taylor (2004), p. 80. This London scene's first fanzine appeared a week later. Its title, Sniffin' Glue, derived from a Ramones song. Its subtitle affirmed the connection with what was happening in New York: "+ Other Rock 'n' Roll Habits for Punks!"Laing (1985), p. 13. Another Sex Pistols gig in Manchester on July 20, with a reorganized version of Buzzcocks debuting in support, gave further impetus to the scene there.Cummins, Kevin, "Closer to the Birth of a Music Legend", The Observer, August 8, 2007, p. 12. In August, the self-described "First European Punk Rock Festival" was held in Mont de Marsan in the southwest of France. Eddie and the Hot Rods, a London pub rock group, headlined. The Sex Pistols, originally scheduled to play, were dropped by the organizers who said the band had gone "too far" in demanding top billing and certain amenities; the Clash backed out in solidarity. The only band from the new punk movement to appear was the Damned.Strongman (2008), pp. 131–132; Savage (1992), p. 216. Strongman describes one of the Sex Pistols' objectionable requests as "some entourage accommodation". Savage says they were dropped from the festival following a violent altercation between Sid Vicious, then part of the Sex Pistols' "entourage", and journalist Nick Kent at a Pistols gig. It is possible that the organizers were specifically afraid of Vicious's attendance. Over the next several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often directly inspired by the Sex Pistols.See, e.g., Marcus (1989), pp. 37, 67. In London, women were near the center of the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 111; Gimarc (2005), p. 39; Robb (2006), pp. 217, 224–225.  Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, identified with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound.Savage (1992), pp. 221, 247. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music.Heylin (1993), p. xii. One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.  In October, the Damned became the first UK punk rock band to release a single, the romance-themed "New Rose".Griffin, Jeff, "The Damned", BBC.co.uk. Retrieved on November 19, 2006. The Vibrators followed the next month with "We Vibrate" and, backing long-time rocker Chris Spedding, "Pogo Dancing". The latter was hardly a punk song by any stretch, but it was perhaps the first song about punk rock. On 26 November, the Sex Pistols' "Anarchy in the U.K." came out—with its debut single the band succeeded in its goal of becoming a "national scandal". Jamie Reid's "anarchy flag" poster and his other design work for the Sex Pistols helped establish a distinctive punk visual aesthetic. On December 1, an incident took place that sealed punk rock's notorious reputation: On Thames Today, an early evening London TV show, Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones was goaded into a verbal altercation by the host, Bill Grundy. Jones called Grundy a "dirty fucker" on live television, triggering a media controversy.Lydon (1995), p. 127; Savage (1992), pp. 257–260; Barkham, Patrick, "Ex-Sex Pistol Wants No Future for Swearing", The Guardian (UK), March 1, 2005. Retrieved on December 17, 2006. Two days later, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Damned, and the Heartbreakers set out on the Anarchy Tour, a series of gigs throughout the UK. Many of the shows were cancelled by venue owners in response to the media outrage following the Grundy confrontation.Savage (1992), pp. 267–275; Lydon (1995), pp. 139–140. By 1977, a second wave of the punk rock movement was breaking in the three countries where it had emerged, as well as in many other places. Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era.Reynolds (2005), p. 211. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.[ "Punk Rock"], AllMusic.

The Sex Pistols' live TV skirmish with Bill Grundy was the signal moment in British punk's transformation into a major media phenomenon, even as some stores refused to stock the records and radio airplay was hard to come by.Savage (1992), pp. 260, 263–67, 277–79; Laing (1985), pp. 35, 37, 38. Press coverage of punk misbehavior grew intense: On January 4, 1977, The Evening News of London ran a front-page story on how the Sex Pistols "vomited and spat their way to an Amsterdam flight".Savage (1992), p. 286. In February 1977, the first album by a British punk band appeared: Damned Damned Damned (by the Damned) reached number thirty-six on the UK chart. The EP Spiral Scratch, self-released by Manchester's Buzzcocks, was a benchmark for both the DIY ethic and regionalism in the country's punk movement.Savage (1992), pp. 296–98; Reynolds (2005), pp. 26–27. The Clash's self-titled debut album came out two months later and rose to number twelve; the single "White Riot" entered the top forty. In May, the Sex Pistols achieved new heights of controversy (and number two on the singles chart) with "God Save the Queen". The band had recently acquired a new bassist, Sid Vicious, who was seen as exemplifying the punk persona.Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 225. Scores of new punk groups formed around the United Kingdom, as far from London as Belfast's Stiff Little Fingers and Dunfermline, Scotland's the Skids. Though most survived only briefly, perhaps recording a small-label single or two, others set off new trends. Crass, from Essex, merged a vehement, straight-ahead punk rock style with a committed anarchist mission, and played a major role in the emerging anarcho-punk movement. Sham 69, London's Menace, and the Angelic Upstarts from South Shields in the Northeast combined a similarly stripped-down sound with populist lyrics, a style that became known as street punk. These expressly working-class bands contrasted with others in the second wave that presaged the post-punk phenomenon. Liverpool's first punk group, Big in Japan, moved in a glam, theatrical direction.Reynolds (2005), pp. 365, 378. The band didn't survive long, but it spun off several well-known post-punk acts.Savage (1991), p. 298.

The punk rock phenomenon helped spark a full-fledged ska revival movement known as 2 Tone, centered on bands such as the Specials, the Beat, Madness, and the Selecter.Hebdige (1987), p. 107. June 1977 saw the release of another charting punk album: the Vibrators' Pure Mania. In July, the Sex Pistols' third single, "Pretty Vacant", reached number six and the Saints had a top-forty hit with "This Perfect Day". Recently arrived from Australia, the band was now considered insufficiently "cool" to qualify as punk by much of the British media, though they had been playing a similar brand of music for years.Wells (2004), p. 114. In August, the Adverts entered the top twenty with "Gary Gilmore's Eyes". As punk became a broad-based national phenomenon in the summer of 1977, punk musicians and fans were increasingly subject to violent assaults by Teddy boys, football yobbos, and others. A Ted-aligned band recorded "The Punk Bashing Boogie".Strongman (2008), pp. 182–84. In September, Generation X and the Clash reached the top forty with, respectively, "Your Generation" and "Complete Control". X-Ray Spex' "Oh Bondage Up Yours!" didn't chart, but it became a requisite item for punk fans.Gaar (2002), p. 200. In October, the Sex Pistols hit number eight with "Holidays in the Sun", followed by the release of their first and only "official" album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. Inspiring yet another round of controversy, it topped the British charts. In December, one of the first books about punk rock was published: The Boy Looked at Johnny, by Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons.The title echoes a lyric from the title track of Patti Smith's 1975 album Horses In February 1977, EMI released the Saints debut album, (I'm) Stranded, which the band recorded in two days.McFaarlane, p. 547.

Meanwhile, punk rock scenes were emerging around the globe. In France, les punks, a Parisian subculture of Lou Reed fans, had already been around for years. Following the lead of Stinky Toys, Métal Urbain played its first concert in December 1976. In August 1977, Asphalt Jungle played at the second Mont de Marsan punk festival.Gimarc (2005), p. 81. Stinky Toys' debut single, "Boozy Creed", came out in September. It was perhaps the first non-English-language punk rock record, though as music historian George Gimarc notes, the punk enunciation made that distinction somewhat moot.Gimarc (2005), p. 89. The following month, Métal Urbain's first 45, "Panik", appeared.Gimarc (2005), p. 97. After the release of their minimalist punk debut, "Rien à dire", Marie et les Garçons became involved in New York's mutant disco scene.James (2003), pp. 91–93. Asphalt Jungle's "Deconnection" and Gasoline's "Killer Man" also came out before the end of the year, and other French punk acts such as Oberkampf and Starshooter soon formed.Thompson (2000), p. 445; OM.

"The Spirit of '77", Spin, p. 58. Other early German punk acts included the Fred Banana Combo and Pack. Bands primarily inspired by British punk sparked what became known as the Neue Deutsche Welle (NDW) movement. Vanguard NDW acts such as the Nina Hagen Band and S.Y.P.H. featured strident vocals and an emphasis on provocation.Burns and Van Der Will (1995), p. 313. Before turning in a mainstream direction in the 1980s, NDW attracted a politically conscious and diverse audience, including both participants of the left-wing alternative scene and neo-Nazi skinheads. These opposing factions were mutually attracted by a view of punk rock as "politically as well as musically...'against the system'." Scandinavian punk was propelled early on by tour dates by bands such as the Clash and the Ramones (both in Stockholm in May 1977), and the Sex Pistols' tour through Denmark, Sweden and Norway in July the same year. The band Briard jump-started Finnish punk with its November 1977 single "I Really Hate Ya"/"I Want Ya Back"; other early Finnish punk acts included Eppu Normaali and singer Pelle Miljoona. The first Swedish punk single was "Vårdad klädsel"/"Förbjudna ljud" released by Kriminella Gitarrer in February 1978, which started an extensive Swedish punk scene featuring act such as Ebba Grön, KSMB, Rude Kids, Besökarna, Liket Lever, Garbochock, Attentat, and many others.

A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as "Hollywood punks" and "beach punks", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of South Bay and Orange County.Blush (2001), p. 18; Reynolds (2006), p. 211; Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 217–32; Stark (2006), "Dissolution" (pp. 91–93); see also, "Round-Table Discussion: Hollywood Vanguard vs. Beach Punks!" (Flipsidezine.com article archive). As hardcore became the dominant punk rock style, many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up, although X went on to mainstream success and the Go-Go's, part of the Hollywood punk scene when they formed in 1978, adopted a pop sound and became major stars.Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 274–79. Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between "classic" punk, post-punk, and hardcore, San Francisco's Flipper was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers.See also Reynolds (2005), pp. 208–11. They became "the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years".Dougan, John. [ Flipper—Biography]. Allmusic. Retrieved on November 26, 2007. Radio Birdman broke up in June 1978 while touring the UK, where the early unity between bohemian, middle-class punks (many with art school backgrounds) and working-class punks had disintegrated.Reynolds (2005), pp. 1–2, 17; Laing (1985), p. 109; Savage (1991), p. 396. In contrast to North America, more of the bands from the original British punk movement remained active, sustaining extended careers even as their styles evolved and diverged. Meanwhile, the Oi! and anarcho-punk movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, "The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.&nbsp;... It became essential to sound one particular way to be recognized as a 'punk band' now."Laing (1985), p. 108. In February 1979, former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious died of a heroin overdose in New York. If the Sex Pistols' breakup the previous year had marked the end of the original UK punk scene and its promise of cultural transformation, for many the death of Vicious signified that it had been doomed from the start.Savage (1992), p. 530.  By the turn of the decade, the punk rock movement had split deeply along cultural and musical lines, leaving a variety of derivative scenes and forms. On one side were new wave and post-punk artists; some adopted more accessible musical styles and gained broad popularity, while some turned in more experimental, less commercial directions. On the other side, hardcore punk, Oi!, and anarcho-punk bands became closely linked with underground cultures and spun off an array of subgenres.Reynolds (2005), p. xvii. Somewhere in between, pop punk groups created blends like that of the ideal record, as defined by Mekons cofounder Kevin Lycett: "a cross between Abba and the Sex Pistols".Quoted in Wells (2004), p. 21. A range of other styles emerged, many of them fusions with long-established genres. The Clash album London Calling, released in December 1979, exemplified the breadth of classic punk's legacy. Combining punk rock with reggae, ska, R&B, and rockabilly, it went on to be acclaimed as one of the best rock records ever.See, e.g., Spencer, Neil, and James Brown, "Why the Clash Are Still Rock Titans", The Observer (UK), October 29, 2006. Retrieved February 28, 2006. At the same time, as observed by Flipper singer Bruce Loose, the relatively restrictive hardcore scenes diminished the variety of music that could once be heard at many punk gigs. If early punk, like most rock scenes, was ultimately male-oriented, the hardcore and Oi! scenes were significantly more so, marked in part by the slam dancing and moshing with which they became identified.Namaste (2000), p. 87; Laing (1985), pp. 90–91.   In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—"New Wave" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as "punk"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable.Gendron (2002), pp. 269–74. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context.Strongman (2008), p. 134. Over time, "new wave" acquired a distinct meaning: Bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated "new wave" and no longer called "punk". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Laing (1985), pp. 37. Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less "dangerous" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic.Wojcik (1995), p. 22.

New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable.[ "New Wave"], Allmusic. Retrieved on January 17, 2007.   During 1976–77, in the midst of the original UK punk movement, bands emerged such as Manchester's Joy Division, the Fall, and Magazine, Leeds' Gang of Four, and London's the Raincoats that became central post-punk figures. Some bands classified as post-punk, such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, had been active well before the punk scene coalesced;Reynolds (2005), p. xxi. others, such as the Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees, transitioned from punk rock into post-punk. A few months after the Sex Pistols' breakup, John Lydon (no longer "Rotten") cofounded Public Image Ltd. Lora Logic, formerly of X-Ray Spex, founded Essential Logic. Killing Joke formed in 1979. These bands were often musically experimental, like certain new wave acts; defining them as "post-punk" was a sound that tended to be less pop and more dark and abrasive—sometimes verging on the atonal, as with Subway Sect and Wire—and an anti-establishment posture directly related to punk's. Post-punk reflected a range of art rock influences from Captain Beefheart to David Bowie and Roxy Music to Krautrock and, once again, the Velvet Underground. Post-punk brought together a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped to develop the production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s.Reynolds (2005), pp. xxvii, xxix. Smoothing the edges of their style in the direction of new wave, several post-punk bands such as New Order (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience. Bauhaus was one of the formative gothic rock bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.Reynolds (2005), p. xxix. A number of U.S. artists were retrospectively defined as post-punk; Television's debut album Marquee Moon, released in 1977, is frequently cited as a seminal album in the field.See, e.g., Television overview by Mike McGuirk, Rhapsody; [ Marquee Moon] review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Allmusic; Television: Marquee Moon (remastered edition) review by Hunter Felt, PopMatters.

A distinctive style of punk, characterized by superfast, aggressive beats, screaming vocals, and often politically aware lyrics, began to emerge in 1978 among bands scattered around the United States and Canada. The first major scene of what came to be known as hardcore punk developed in Southern California in 1978–79, initially around such punk bands as the Germs and Fear.Blush (2001), pp. 16–17. The movement soon spread around North America and internationally. According to author Steven Blush, "Hardcore comes from the bleak suburbs of America. Parents moved their kids out of the cities to these horrible suburbs to save them from the 'reality' of the cities and what they ended up with was this new breed of monster".  Among the earliest hardcore bands, regarded as having made the first recordings in the style, were Southern California's Middle Class and Black Flag.Blush (2001), p. 17; Coker, Matt, "Suddenly In Vogue: The Middle Class May Have Been the Most Influential Band You’ve Never Heard Of", OC Weekly, December 5, 2002.Van Dorston, A.S., "A History of Punk", fastnbulbous.com, January 1990.

By 1981, hardcore was the dominant punk rock style not only in California, but much of the rest of North America as well.Blush (2001), pp. 12–21. A New York hardcore scene grew, including the relocated Bad Brains, New Jersey's Misfits and Adrenalin O.D., and local acts such as the Nihilistics, the Mob, Reagan Youth, and Agnostic Front. Beastie Boys, who would become famous as a hip-hop group, debuted that year as a hardcore band. They were followed by the Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, and Leeway.Andersen and Jenkins (2001), p. 89; Blush (2001), p. 173;  By 1983, St. Paul's Hüsker Dü, Willful Neglect, Chicago's Naked Raygun, Indianapolis's Zero Boys, and D.C.'s the Faith were taking the hardcore sound in experimental and ultimately more melodic directions. Hardcore would constitute the American punk rock standard throughout the decade.Leblanc (1999), p. 59. The lyrical content of hardcore songs is often critical of commercial culture and middle-class values, as in Dead Kennedys' celebrated "Holiday in Cambodia" (1980). Straight edge bands like Minor Threat, Boston's SS Decontrol, and Reno, Nevada's 7 Seconds rejected the self-destructive lifestyles of many of their peers, and built a movement based on positivity and abstinence from cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and casual sex.Lamacq, Steve, "x True Til Death x", BBC Radio 1, 2003. Retrieved on January 14, 2007. Skate punk innovators also pointed in other directions: Big Boys helped establish funkcore, while Venice, California's Suicidal Tendencies had a formative effect on the heavy metal–influenced crossover thrash style. Toward the middle of the decade, D.R.I. spawned the superfast thrashcore genre. Both developed in multiple locations.Weinstein (2000), p. 49. Sacramento's Tales of Terror, which mixed psychedelic rock into their hardcore sound, were an early influence on the grunge genre. D.C.'s Void was one of the first punk-metal crossover acts and influenced thrash metal.   Following the lead of first-wave British punk bands Cock Sparrer and Sham 69, in the late 1970s second-wave units like Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts, the Exploited, Anti-Establishment and the 4-Skins sought to realign punk rock with a working class, street-level following.Dalton, Stephen, "Revolution Rock", Vox, June 1993.

Their style was originally called "real punk" or street punk; Sounds journalist Garry Bushell is credited with labelling the genre Oi! in 1980. The name is partly derived from the Cockney Rejects' habit of shouting "Oi! Oi! Oi!" before each song, instead of the time-honored "1,2,3,4!"Robb (2006), p. 469.  The Oi! movement was fueled by a sense that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of the Business guitarist Steve Kent, "trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic&nbsp;... and losing touch".Quoted in Robb (2006), pp. 469–70. According to Bushell, "Punk was meant to be of the voice of the dole queue, and in reality most of them were not. But Oi was the reality of the punk mythology. In the places where [these bands] came from, it was harder and more aggressive and it produced just as much quality music."Robb (2006), p. 470. Lester Bangs described Oi! as "politicized football chants for unemployed louts".Bangs, Lester. "If Oi Were a Carpenter". Village Voice. April 27, 1982. One song in particular, the Exploited's "Punks Not Dead", spoke to an international constituency. It was adopted as an anthem by the groups of disaffected Mexican urban youth known in the 1980s as bandas; one banda named itself PND, after the song's initials.Berthier (2004), p. 246. Although most Oi! bands in the initial wave were apolitical or left wing, many of them began to attract a white power skinhead following. Racist skinheads sometimes disrupted Oi! concerts by shouting fascist slogans and starting fights, but some Oi! bands were reluctant to endorse criticism of their fans from what they perceived as the "middle-class establishment".Fleischer, Tzvi. "Sounds of Hate". Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC), August 2000. Retrieved on January 14, 2007. In the popular imagination, the movement thus became linked to the far right.Robb (2006), pp. 469, 512. Strength Thru Oi!, an album compiled by Bushell and released in May 1981, stirred controversy, especially when it was revealed that the belligerent figure on the cover was a neo-Nazi jailed for racist violence (Bushell claimed ignorance). On July 3, a concert at Hamborough Tavern in Southall featuring the Business, the 4-Skins, and the Last Resort was firebombed by local Asian youths who believed that the event was a neo-Nazi gathering.Gimarc (1997), p. 175; Laing (1985), p. 112. Following the Southall riot, press coverage increasingly associated Oi! with the extreme right, and the movement soon began to lose momentum.Robb (2006), p. 511.    Anarcho-punk developed alongside the Oi! and American hardcore movements. Inspired by Crass, its Dial House commune, and its independent Crass Records label, a scene developed around British bands such as Subhumans, Flux of Pink Indians, Conflict, Poison Girls, and the Apostles that was concerned as much with anarchist and DIY principles as it was with music. The acts featured ranting vocals, discordant instrumental sounds, primitive production values, and lyrics filled with political and social content, often addressing issues such as class inequalities and military violence.Gosling (2004), p. 170. Anarcho-punk musicians and fans disdained the older punk scene from which theirs had evolved. In historian Tim Gosling's description, they saw "safety pins and Mohicans as little more than ineffectual fashion posturing stimulated by the mainstream media and industry.... Whereas the Sex Pistols would proudly display bad manners and opportunism in their dealings with 'the establishment,' the anarcho-punks kept clear of 'the establishment' altogether".Gosling (2004), pp. 169–70. The movement spun off several subgenres of a similar political bent. Discharge, founded back in 1977, established D-beat in the early 1980s. Other groups in the movement, led by Amebix and Antisect, developed the extreme style known as crust punk. Several of these bands rooted in anarcho-punk such as the Varukers, Discharge, and Amebix, along with former Oi! groups such as the Exploited and bands from father afield like Birmingham's Charged GBH, became the leading figures in the UK 82 hardcore movement. The anarcho-punk scene also spawned bands such as Napalm Death, Carcass, and Extreme Noise Terror that in the mid-1980s defined grindcore, incorporating extremely fast tempos and death metal–style guitarwork.Purcell (2003), pp. 56–57. Led by Dead Kennedys, a U.S. anarcho-punk scene developed around such bands as Austin's MDC and Southern California's Another Destructive System.News Items. SOS Records, March 12, 2007; Links Anima Mundi. Both retrieved on November 25, 2007.    With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk.Besssman (1993), p. 16; Carson (1979), p. 114; Simpson (2003), p. 72; McNeil (1997), p. 206. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge.Cooper, Ryan. "The Buzzcocks, Founders of Pop Punk". About.com. Retrieved on December 16, 2006. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion "layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies"; Descendents "wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys–inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)".Myers (2006), p. 52. Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would talk a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, "It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures."Di Bella, Christine. "Blink 182 + Green Day". PopMatters.com. June 11, 2002. Retrieved on February 4, 2007. From 1977 on, punk rock crossed lines with many other popular music genres. Los Angeles punk rock bands laid the groundwork for a wide variety of styles: the Flesh Eaters with deathrock; the Plugz with Chicano punk; and Gun Club with punk blues. The Meteors, from South London, and the Cramps, who moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1980, were innovators in the psychobilly fusion style.Porter (2007), p. 86. Milwaukee's Violent Femmes jumpstarted the American folk punk scene, while the Pogues did the same on the other side of the Atlantic, influencing many Celtic punk bands.Hendrickson, Tad. "Irish Pub-Rock: Boozy Punk Energy, Celtic Style". NPR Music, March 16, 2009. Retrieved on November 12, 2010. Hardcore punk was combined with hip hop, creating rapcore. Other bands pointed punk rock toward future rock styles or its own foundations. New York's Suicide, L.A.'s the Screamers and Nervous Gender, Australia's JAB, and Germany's Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft were pioneers of electropunk. The Ex, from the Netherlands, were in the art punk vanguard.Hopper, Justin. "The Ex: 27 Years of Dutch Art-punk". Pittsburgh City Paper, December 7, 2006. Retrieved on November 14, 2010. Chicago's Big Black was a major influence on noise rock, math rock, and industrial rock. Garage punk bands from all over—such as Medway's Thee Mighty Caesars, Chicago's Dwarves, and Adelaide's Exploding White Mice—pursued a version of punk rock that was close to its roots in 1960s garage rock. Seattle's Mudhoney, one of the central bands in the development of grunge, has been described as "garage punk".Simpson (2003), p. 42.   The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector.Laing (1985), pp. 118, 128. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity.Goodlad and Bibby (2007), p. 16. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called "college rock".Azerrad (2001), passim; for relationship of Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, see pp. 205–6. A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, "Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead."Goldberg, Michael, "Punk Lives", Rolling Stone, July 18 – August 1, 1985. By the end of the 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including gothic rock and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream. As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years.Friedlander and Miller (2006), pp. 256, 278. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's grunge scene, achieving huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind. The band's members cited punk rock as a key influence on their style."Kurt Donald Cobain", Biography Channel. Retrieved on November 19, 2006. "Punk is musical freedom", wrote singer Kurt Cobain. "It’s saying, doing, and playing what you want."Quoted in St. Thomas (2004), p. 94. Nirvana's success opened the door to mainstream popularity for a wide range of other "left-of-the-dial" acts, such as Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers, and fueled the alternative rock boom of the early and mid-1990s.  In its original, mid-1980s incarnation, emo was a less musically restrictive style of punk developed by participants in the Washington, D.C. area hardcore scene. It was originally referred to as "emocore", an abbreviation of "emotive hardcore".Greenwald (2003), pp. 9–12. Jimmy Eat World took emo in a radio-ready pop punk direction,Pierce, Carrie, "Jimmy Eat World: Futures—Interscope Records", The Battalion, November 24, 2004. Retrieved on December 2, 2007. and had top ten albums in 2004 and 2007.   In the 1990s, the queercore movement developed around a number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as Against Me!, God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, gender identity, and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.Spencer (2005), pp. 279–89.  The Riot Grrrl movement, a significant aspect in the formation of the Third Wave feminist movement, was organized by taking the values and rhetoric of punk and using it to convey feminist messages. In 1991, a concert of female-led bands at the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, Washington, heralded the emerging riot grrrl phenomenon. Billed as "Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now", the concert's lineup included Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, L7, and Mecca Normal.Raha (2005), p. 154. The riot grrrl movement foregrounded feminist concerns and progressive politics in general; the DIY ethic and fanzines were also central elements of the scene.Jackson (2005), pp. 261–62. This movement relied on media and technology to spread their ideas and messages, creating a cultural-technological space for feminism to voice their concerns. They embodied the punk perspective, taking the anger and emotions and creating a separate culture from it. With riot grrrl, they were grounded in girl punk past, but also rooted in modern feminism. Singer-guitarists Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17, bands active in both the queercore and riot grrrl scenes, cofounded the indie/punk band Sleater-Kinney in 1994. Bikini Kill's lead singer, Kathleen Hanna, the iconic figure of riot grrrl, moved on to form the art punk group Le Tigre in 1998.McGowen, Brice. "Eye of the Tiger". Lamda, February/March 2005. Retrieved on November 26, 2007.    By the 1990s, punk rock was sufficiently ingrained in Western culture that punk trappings were often used to market highly commercial bands as "rebels". Marketers capitalized on the style and hipness of punk rock to such an extent that a 1993 ad campaign for an automobile, the Subaru Impreza, claimed that the car was "like punk rock".Klein (2000), p. 300. Along with Nirvana, many of the leading alternative rock artists of the early 1990s acknowledged the influence of earlier punk rock acts. With Nirvana's success, the major record companies once again saw punk bands as potentially profitable.Zuel, Bernard (April 2, 2004), "Searching for Nirvana", Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved on September 1, 2007. In 1993, California's Green Day and Bad Religion were both signed to major labels.

In 1994, Epitaph released Let's Go by Rancid, Punk in Drublic by NOFX, and Smash by the Offspring, each eventually certified gold or better. That June, Green Day's "Longview" reached number one on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart and became a top forty airplay hit, arguably the first ever American punk song to do so; just one month later, the Offspring's "Come Out and Play" followed suit. MTV and radio stations such as Los Angeles' KROQ-FM played a major role in these bands' crossover success, though NOFX refused to let MTV air its videos.Gold, Jonathan. "The Year Punk Broke." SPIN. November 1994. Following the lead of Boston's Mighty Mighty Bosstones and two California bands, Anaheim's No Doubt and Long Beach's Sublime, ska punk and ska-core became widely popular in the mid-1990s. By 1996, genre acts such as Reel Big Fish and Less Than Jake were being signed to major labels. The original 2 Tone bands had emerged amid punk rock's second wave, but their music was much closer to its Jamaican roots—"ska at 78 rpm".Hebdige (1987), p. 111. Ska punk bands in the third wave of ska created a true musical fusion between the genres. ...And Out Come the Wolves, the 1995 album by Rancid—which had evolved out of Operation Ivy—became the first record in this ska revival to be certified gold;...And Out Come the Wolves was certified gold in January 1996. Let's Go, Rancid's previous album, received gold certification in July 2000. Sublime's self-titled 1996 album was certified platinum early in 1997.

Retrieved on December 3, 2007. With punk rock's renewed visibility came concerns among some in the punk community that the music was being co-opted by the mainstream. They argued that by signing to major labels and appearing on MTV, punk bands like Green Day were buying into a system that punk was created to challenge.Myers (2006), p. 120. Such controversies have been part of the punk culture since 1977, when the Clash was widely accused of "selling out" for signing with CBS Records.Knowles (2003), p. 44. The Vans Warped Tour and the mall chain store Hot Topic brought punk even further into the U.S. mainstream.Diehl (2007), pp. 2, 145, 227.  By early 1998, the punk revival had commercially stalled,Gross (2004), p. 677. but not for long. That November, the Offspring's Americana on the major Columbia label debuted at number two on the album chart. A bootleg MP3 of its first single, "Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)", made it onto the Internet and was downloaded a record 22 million times—illegally.Diehl (2003), p. 72. The following year, Enema of the State, the first major-label release by pop punk band Blink-182, reached the top ten and sold four million copies in under twelve months. In January 2000, the album's second single, "All the Small Things", hit the sixth spot on the Billboard Hot 100. While they were viewed as Green Day "acolytes",Spitz (2006), p. 144. critics also found teen pop acts such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, and 'N Sync suitable points of comparison for Blink-182's sound and market niche.Blasengame, Bart.

The band's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and Blink-182 (2003) respectively rose to numbers one and three on the album chart. In November 2003, The New Yorker described how the "giddily puerile" act had "become massively popular with the mainstream audience, a demographic formerly considered untouchable by punk-rock purists.""Goings On About Town: Nightlife". The New Yorker. November 10, 2003, p. 24. Other new North American pop punk bands, though often critically dismissed, also achieved major sales in the first decade of the 2000s. Ontario's Sum 41 reached the Canadian top ten with its 2001 debut album, All Killer, No Filler, which eventually went platinum in the United States. The record included the number one U.S. Alternative hit "Fat Lip", which incorporated verses of what one critic called "brat rap."Sinagra (2004), p. 791. The effect of commercialization on the music became an increasingly contentious issue. As observed by scholar Ross Haenfler, many punk fans "'despise corporate punk rock', typified by bands such as Sum&nbsp;41 and Blink&nbsp;182".Haenfler (2006), p. 12. At the same time, politicized and independent-label punk continued to thrive in the United States. Since 1993, Anti-Flag had been putting progressive politics at the center of its music. The administration of George W. Bush provided them and similarly minded acts eight years of conservative government to excoriate. Rise Against was the most successful of these groups, registering top ten records in 2006 with The Sufferer & the Witness and two years later with Appeal to Reason. Leftist punk band Against Me!'s New Wave was named best album of 2007 by Spin.  Elsewhere around the world, "punkabilly" band the Living End became major stars in Australia with their self-titled 1998 debut.
