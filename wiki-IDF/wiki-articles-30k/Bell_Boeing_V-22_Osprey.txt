   The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. The V-22 originated from the United States Department of Defense Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. The team of Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor intended for military service in the world led to many years of development. The United States Marine Corps began crew training for the Osprey in 2000, and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The Osprey's other operator, the U.S. Air Force, fielded their version of the tiltrotor in 2009. Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medivac operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Kuwait.

The U.S. Department of Defense began the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program in 1981, under U.S. Army leadership. The defining mission of the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were particularly interested in the JVX program. They realized that a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal;Whittle 2010, p. 55. and their CH-46s were wearing out;Whittle 2010, p. 91. without replacement, the threat of a merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered,Whittle 2010, p. 87: "As Kelly saw it, the future of the Marine Corps was riding on it."Whittle 2010, p. 155. similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II.Whittle 2010, pp. 53, 55–56.

From October 1992 – April 1993, Bell and Boeing redesigned the V-22 to reduce empty weight, simplify manufacture, and reduce production costs. This redesigned version became the V-22B model.  V-22 flights resumed in June 1993 after safety improvements were incorporated in the prototypes.Norton 2004, p. 55.  Bell Boeing was awarded a contract for the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase in June 1994.Norton 2004, pp. 52–54.

Flight testing at the stage focused on expanding the flight envelope, measuring flight loads, and supporting the EMD redesign.  This and further flight testing with the early V-22s continued into 1997.Norton 2004, pp. 55–57. Flight testing of four full-scale development V-22s began in early 1997 when the first pre-production V-22 was delivered to the Naval Air Warfare Test Center, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland.

"Boeing looks ahead to a 'V-23' Osprey." Flight Global, 22 June 2009. Archived on 12 January 2015. A V-22 must maintain at least  of vertical separation between each other to avoid their rotor wake, which can cause turbulence and potentially lead to a loss of control. The V-22 is equipped with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four Multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared Central Display Unit (CDU), to display various images including: digimaps, imagery from the Turreted Forward Looking Infrared System"V-22 Osprey – Boeing" primary flight instruments, navigation (TACAN, VOR, ILS, GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a  hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system.Ringenbach, Daniel P. and Scott Brick. "Hardware-in-the-loop testing for development and integration of the V-22 autopilot system, pp. 28–36" (PDF).

The V-22 has triple-redundant fly-by-wire flight control systems.Landis, Kenneth H., et al. "Advanced flight control technology achievements at Boeing Helicopters." International Journal of Control, Volume 59, Issue 1, 1994, pp. 263–290.

Archived on 11 January 2015. With the nacelles pointing straight up in conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With the nacelles in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly the aircraft like an airplane. This is a gradual transition and occurs over the rotation range of the nacelles. The lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces.Norton 2004, pp. 6–9, 95–96. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight.Markman and Holder 2000, p. 58.Norton 2004, p. 97.  The V-22 can use the "80 Jump" orientation with the nacelles at 80° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed.  Aspects of the V-22's flight are automated and simplified by the control system such that the V-22 can hover (in low wind) with no hands on the controls. According to some who have flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable because they (unlike those with helicopter experience) are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering. The Osprey can be armed with one 7.62×51mm NATO (.308&nbsp;in caliber) M240 machine gun or .50 in caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) M2 machine gun on the loading ramp, that can be fired rearward when the ramp is lowered.

"BAE Remote Guardians Join Osprey Fleet." Rotor & Wing Magazine, 1 January 2010. The IDWS was installed on half of the first V-22s deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, but found limited use due to its  weight and restrictive rules of engagement.Lamothe, Dan. "Ospreys leave new belly gun in the dust." Marine Corps Times, 28 June 2010. Retrieved: 28 June 2010.  There were 32 IDWSs available to the Marine Corps in June 2012. The system had not been fired in combat as V-22s were routinely escorted by helicopter gunships and close air support aircraft, allowing them to focus on their transport role; squadrons also often flew without the belly gun, as the added weight reduced its cargo-carrying capacity. The Osprey's speed means it can outrun supporting conventional helicopters, requiring a self-defense capability on long-range missions and operate independently. The infrared gun camera has proven valuable for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons are being studied to provide an all-quadrant defensive weapon system including nose guns, door guns, and nonlethal countermeasures to work with the current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS."Corps seeks better weaponry on Ospreys". Marinecorpstimes.com, 13 February 2012. In 2014, the USMC revealed plans for new V-22 weapons "to increase all-axis, stand-off, and precision capabilities", which may be potentially operated by additional crew members. Armament increases are for enhanced offensive capabilities to special purpose Marine rapid crisis response task forces, rather than as an attack platform. The V-22 could be adapted for various precision weapons, including the AGM-114 Hellfire, AGM-176 Griffin, Joint Air-to-Ground Missile, and GBU-53/B SDB II. Fuselage-based hardpoints would be used to clear the proprotors.Corps' aviation plan calls for armed Ospreys – MarineCorpstimes.com, 23 November 2014 In November 2014, Bell and Boeing conducted self-funded weapons tests using a V-22 equipped with a small pylon on the front port-side fuselage and the AN/AAQ-27A EO camera replaced with an L-3 Wescam MX-15 sensor/laser designator. 26 unguided Hydra 70 rockets, two guided APKWS rockets, and two Griffin B missiles were fired over five flights.

The operator must open the ramp to extend the refueling hose, then raise the ramp once extended, with the top ramp door left open. The V-22 could refuel rotary-wing aircraft, but it would require a separate drogue used specifically by helicopters and a partially converted nacelle. Bell and Boeing are hoping for funding for additional testing to include contact between the refueler and receiver and eventually the passage of fuel."New Pics: MV-22, Hornet in Refueling Tests".
