    Barry Alan Crompton Gibb,  (born 1 September 1946) is a British singer, songwriter and record producer who rose to worldwide fame as a co-founder of the group Bee Gees, one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed groups in the history of popular music. With his brothers, Robin and Maurice Gibb, he formed a songwriting partnership beginning in 1966. Born on the Isle of Man, he was raised in Manchester where he became involved in the skiffle craze, forming his first band, the Rattlesnakes, which evolved into the Bee Gees in 1960 when they moved to Redcliffe, Queensland, Australia. They returned to England where they achieved worldwide fame. He was also known for his high-pitched falsetto singing voice. Gibb shares the record with John Lennon and Paul McCartney for consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number ones as a writer with six.  Guinness World Records lists Gibb as the second most successful songwriter in history behind Sir Paul McCartney. Gibb's career has spanned over fifty years. In 1994, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame with his brothers. In 1997, as a member of the Bee Gees, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

Barry Alan Crompton Gibb was born in Jane Crookall Maternity Home at 8:45 AM in Douglas, Isle of Man, to Hugh Gibb, a drummer, and Barbara Gibb (née Pass). He has English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He has an older sister, Lesley Evans. He was named Barry Alan Crompton Gibb after his father's youngest brother Alan, who died in infancy. According to Hugh, in a mix of fact and fiction, the third name was given to Barry to honor the Gibbs' illustrious ancestor, Isaac Crompton. When Gibb was born, his father was busy with his music working at various hotels in Douglas, while his mother stayed at home looking after the children. Later, the Gibbs moved to Chapel House on Strang Road. When he was almost two years old, he was badly burned. His mother had just made tea which she had put on the table; he climbed up and pulled the tea pot down and got the tea all over him. He was in Nobles Hospital for about two-and-a-half months. Gibb later commented on that incident: "Then the gangrene set in. Because in those days, the advancement of medicine simply didn't apply to people with bad scalds, so you didn't have skin grafts, you didn't have things like that. But this was a particularly bad scald, and I think I had 20 minutes to live at some point. The incredible thing for me is that whole two years is wiped from my memory, the whole period of being in hospital. The idea of being burnt is in there somewhere, but I have no knowledge of it. I've got the scars but I have no knowledge". In 1949, the Gibb family relocated to 50 St. Catherine's Drive. Later that year, on 22 December, his two younger brothers Robin and Maurice were born. When the twins were young, they moved to Smedley Cottage, Spring Valley, also in Douglas. Gibb started school on 4 September 1951, three days after his fifth birthday, attending Braddan school. In 1952, the Gibb family relocated to 43 Snaefell Road, Willaston, which became their home for the next two years. The same year, he went to Tynwald Street Infants School.

The Rattlesnakes' first professional gig happened on 28 December 1957 in Gaumont Cinema. Around 1958, Gibb's guitar was accidentally broke by Frost, while Frost himself described the incident as "broken in the middle". By May 1958 when the Gibbs moved in Northern Grove it signalled the departure of Frost and Horrocks. The brothers later changed the name of the group to Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats. Under that name, they performed regularly in Minor 15, a talent contest for under-fifteens held on Thursday nights from 7:00 to 9:00 PM at Princess Club in Chorlton. At the beginning of August 1958, the Gibb family set sail for Australia from Southampton on a ship called Fairsea. Also aboard was Red Symons, future guitarist of Skyhooks as well as Kylie Minogue's mother. They later changed their name to Bee Gees. In 1959, the brothers began singing at the  Redcliffe Speedway between races to earn money, their vocal talent brought them to the attention of Bill Gates, a radio deejay.

After hearing those songs, Gates asked him for more original material for the tape. Gibb quit school in September 1961 and the Gibbs moved to the Surfers Paradise.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band photo shoot earlier that day on 30 March 1967; And after a couple of scotch and cokes, Townshend asked Gibb and said, "Do you want to meet John?" and he led Gibb across to a room where Lennon was holding court and Townshend said, "John. This is Barry Gibb, from the group the Bee Gees" to which Lennon replied, "Howyadoin'"."So i met John Lennon's back",  Gibb says with a laugh, "I didn't meet his front". Gibb earlier said in 2010 about the meeting, "It was virtually a closed club and you went downstairs and there was a coffin and if you were someone they knew and you were supposed to go in, the wall would turn around... and in you would go. There would be [Rolling] Stones lying around all over the place. It was one of those days when I met John Lennon - from the back. It was Pete Townshend who introduced me... [Lennon said], 'Pleased to meet you', and he carried on talking to his guest."  At the end of 1967, fame was taking its toll and the group were at odds with each other.
