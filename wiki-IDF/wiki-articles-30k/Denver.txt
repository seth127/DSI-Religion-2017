      Denver (officially, The City and County of Denver) (; Arapaho: Niinéniiniicíihéhe') is the capital and most populous municipality of the U.S. state of Colorado. As of 2014, Denver is also the most populous county in Colorado. Denver is located in the South Platte River Valley on the western edge of the High Plains just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The Denver downtown district is located immediately east of the confluence of Cherry Creek with the South Platte River, approximately  east of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Denver is nicknamed the Mile-High City because its official elevation is exactly one mile () above sea level, making it one of the highest major cities in the United States. The 105th meridian west of Greenwich, the longitudinal reference for the Mountain Time Zone, passes directly through Denver Union Station. Denver is ranked as a Beta- world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. With a 2014 estimated population of 663,862, Denver ranks as the 21st-most populous U.S. city. The 10-county Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated 2013 population of 2,697,476 and ranked as the 21st most populous U.S. metropolitan statistical area.  The 12-city Denver-Aurora, CO Combined Statistical Area had an estimated 2013 population of 3,277,309, which ranks as the 16th most populous U.S. metropolitan area.  Denver is the most populous city of the Front Range Urban Corridor, an oblong urban region stretching across two states with population of 5,467,633 in 2010.  Denver is the most populous city within a  radius and the most populous city in the Mountain West and the third-most populous city in the Southwestern United States after Phoenix, Arizona and El Paso, Texas. Its metropolitan population is the second-largest in the Southwest after that of Phoenix. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center study, Denver ranks as the most popular American city, based on where people want to live.    Denver City was founded in November 1858 as a mining town during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in western Kansas Territory.  That summer, a group of gold prospectors from Lawrence, Kansas, had arrived and established Montana City on the banks of the South Platte River. This was the first settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly, however, and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of Auraria (named after the gold mining town of Auraria, Georgia), and St. Charles City. On November 22, 1858, General William Larimer, a land speculator from eastern Kansas Territory, placed cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek, across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria, and on the site of the existing townsite of St. Charles. Larimer named the town site Denver City to curry favor with Kansas Territorial Governor James W. Denver.  Larimer hoped that the town's name would help make it the county seat of Arapaho County, but unknown to him Governor Denver had already resigned from office. The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The site of these first towns is now the site of Confluence Park near downtown Denver. Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company, sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new emigrants. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock and goods trading. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria. In May 1859, Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth & Pike's Peak Express in order to secure the region's first overland wagon route. Offering daily service for "passengers, mail, freight, and gold," the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six. In 1863, Western Union furthered Denver's dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus. The Colorado Territory was created on February 28, 1861, Arapahoe County was formed on November 1, 1861, and Denver City was incorporated on November 7, 1861. Denver City served as the Arapahoe County Seat from 1861 until consolidation in 1902. In 1867, Denver City became the Territorial Capital. With its new-found importance, Denver City shortened its name to Denver. On August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted to the Union.  Although by the close of the 1860s, Denver residents could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. A daunting 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders to take control of the debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.Baker, Gayle, Denver, HarborTown Histories. Santa Barbara, CA, p. 31-33, ISBN 9780971098442 (print), 9780987903860 (on-line) Finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail, Denver prospered as a service and supply center. The young city grew during these years, attracting millionaires with their mansions, as well as the poverty and crime of a rapidly growing city. Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled that Horace Tabor, the Leadville mining millionaire, built an impressive business block at 16th and Larimer as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House. Luxurious hotels, including the much-loved Brown Palace Hotel, soon followed, as well as splendid homes for millionaires like the Croke, Patterson, Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now-demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant.Baker, p. 39-48 Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world's great cities, leaders wooed industry and enticed laborers to work in these factories. Soon, in addition to the elite and a large middle class, Denver had a growing population of German, Italian, and Chinese laborers, soon followed by African-Americans and Spanish-surname workers. Unprepared for this influx, the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political, social, and economic balances, laying the foundation for ethnic bigotry, such as the Red Scare and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, as well as corruption and crime.Baker, p. 51-55  Between 1880 and 1895 the city experienced a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as Soapy Smith, worked side by side with elected officials and the police to control elections, gambling, and the bunko gangs. The city also experienced a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver's poor.United Way History.

Retrieved: July 20, 2006 In 1900, whites represented 96.8% of Denver's population. In 1901, the Colorado General Assembly voted to split Arapahoe County into three parts: a new consolidated City and County of Denver, a new Adams County, and the remainder of the Arapahoe County to be renamed South Arapahoe County. A ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court, subsequent legislation, and a referendum delayed the creation of the City and County of Denver until November 15, 1902. Denver has hosted the Democratic National Convention twice, during the years of 1908, and again in 2008, taking the opportunity to promote the city's status on the national, political, and socioeconomic stage. Early in the 20th century, Denver, like many other cities, was home to a pioneering Brass Era car company. The Colburn Automobile Company made cars copied from the contemporary Renault.Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.87. From 1953 to 1989, the Rocky Flats Plant, a DOE nuclear weapon facility formerly located about 15 miles from Denver, produced fissile plutonium "pits" for nuclear warheads. A major fire at the facility in 1957, as well as leakage from nuclear waste stored at the site between 1958 and 1968, resulted in the contamination of some parts of Denver, to varying degrees, with plutonium-239, a harmful radioactive substance with a half-life of 24,200 years. A study by the Jefferson County health director, Dr. Carl Johnson, in 1981 linked the contamination to an increase in birth defects and cancer incidence in central Denver and nearer Rocky Flats. Later studies confirmed many of his findings., cited in .http://www.rockyflatsnuclearguardianship.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/leroy-moore-papers/dem-public-heath-at-rf-12-10.pdf Plutonium contamination was still present outside the former plant site , and presents risks to building the envisioned Jefferson Parkway, which would complete Denver's automotive beltway.  Denver was selected in 1970 to host the 1976 Winter Olympics to coincide with Colorado's centennial celebration, but in November 1972 Colorado voters struck down ballot initiatives allocating public funds to pay for the high costs of the games, which were subsequently moved to Innsbruck, Austria. The notoriety of becoming the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being selected has made subsequent bids difficult. The movement against hosting the games was based largely on environmental issues and was led by State Representative Richard Lamm, who was subsequently elected to three terms (1975–87) as Colorado governor.Archives | Denver explored a potential bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics,Committee Recommends Denver 2022 Winter Games Bid but no bid will be submitted. In 2010, Denver adopted a comprehensive update of its zoning code. The new zoning was developed to guide development as envisioned in adopted plans such as Blueprint Denver, Transit Oriented Development Strategic Plan, Greenprint Denver, and the Strategic Transportation Plan. Denver has also been known historically as the Queen City of the Plains and the Queen City of the West, because of its important role in the agricultural industry of the high-plains region in eastern Colorado and along the foothills of the Colorado Front Range. Several US Navy ships have been named USS Denver in honor of the city.       Denver is located in the center of the Front Range Urban Corridor, between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the High Plains to the east. Denver's topography consists of plains in the city center with hilly areas to the north, west and south. According to the United States Census Bureau the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  (1.1%) is water. The City and County of Denver is surrounded by only three other counties: Adams County to the north and east, Arapahoe County to the south and east, and Jefferson County to the west. Although Denver's nickname is the "Mile-High City" because its official elevation is one mile above sea level, defined by the elevation of the spot of a benchmark on the steps of the State Capitol building, the elevation of the entire city ranges from . According to Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and the National Elevation Dataset, the city's elevation is , which is reflected on various websites such as that of the National Weather Service.    As of January 2013, the City and County of Denver has defined 78 official neighborhoods that the city and community groups use for planning and administration. Although the city's delineation of the neighborhood boundaries is somewhat arbitrary, it corresponds roughly to the definitions used by residents. These "neighborhoods" should not be confused with cities or suburbs, which may be separate entities within the metro area. The character of the neighborhoods varies significantly from one to another and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are the focal point for the neighborhood. Denver does not have larger area designations, unlike the City of Chicago, which has larger areas that house the neighborhoods (IE: Northwest Side). Denver residents use the terms "north" "south" "east" and "west". Denver also has a number of neighborhoods not reflected in the administrative boundaries. These neighborhoods may reflect the way people in an area identify themselves or they might reflect how others, such as real estate developers, have defined those areas. Well-known non-administrative neighborhoods include the historic and trendy LoDo (short for "Lower Downtown"), part of the city's Union Station neighborhood; Uptown, straddling North Capitol Hill and City Park West; Curtis Park, part of the Five Points neighborhood; Alamo Placita, the northern part of the Speer neighborhood; Park Hill, a successful example of intentional racial integration; and Golden Triangle, in the Civic Center. ===Adjacent counties, municipalities and CDPs=== {| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;" |- | style="width:35%; text-align:center;"| | style="width:30%; text-align:center;" |'''North:''' '''''[[Adams County, Colorado|Adams County]]''''', [[Berkley, Colorado|Berkley]], [[Northglenn, Colorado|Northglenn]], [[Commerce City, Colorado|Commerce City]] | style="width:35%; text-align:center;"| |- | style="width:10%; text-align:center;" |'''West:''' '''''[[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]]''''', [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]], [[Lakeside, Colorado|Lakeside]], [[Mountain View, Colorado|Mountain View]], [[Edgewater, Colorado|Edgewater]], [[Lakewood, Colorado|Lakewood]], [[Dakota Ridge, Colorado|Dakota Ridge]] | style="width:35%; text-align:center;" |'''Denver'''<br />'''Enclave:''' '''''[[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]]''''', [[Glendale, Colorado|Glendale]], [[Holly Hills, Colorado|Holly Hills]] | style="width:30%; text-align:center;" |'''''[[Adams County, Colorado|Adams County]]'''''<br />'''East:''' [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]]<br />'''''[[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]]''''' |- | style="width:35%; text-align:center;"| | style="width:30%; text-align:center;"|'''South:''' '''''[[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]]''''', [[Bow Mar, Colorado|Bow Mar]], [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], [[Sheridan, Colorado|Sheridan]], [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]], [[Cherry Hills Village, Colorado|Cherry Hills Village]], [[Greenwood Village, Colorado|Greenwood Village]], [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]] | style="width:35%; text-align:center;"| |}  ===Climate=== Denver lies within the [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], [[Continentality|continental]] climate zone ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Cold semi-arid climate|BSk]]'').<ref>{{cite web   |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7v.html   |title=Climate Classification and Climatic Regions of the World   |accessdate=March 15, 2010   |publisher=PhysicalGeography.net }}</ref> It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest amount of precipitation spread through the year.

Because Denver is the largest city within {{convert|500|mi|km|-2}}, it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the [[Mountain States]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest states]], as well as all [[Western United States|western states]]. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], such as Chicago and [[St. Louis]] and some large cities of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Over the years, the city has been home to other large corporations in the central United States, making Denver a key trade point for the country. Several well-known companies originated in or have relocated to Denver. William Ainsworth opened the Denver Instrument Company in 1895 to make analytical balances for gold assayers. Its factory is now in [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]]. [[AIMCO]] (NYSE: AIV)—the largest owner and operator of apartment communities in the United States, with approximately 870 communities comprising nearly 136,000 units in 44 states—is headquartered in Denver, employing approximately 3,500 people. Also [[Samsonite]] Corp., the world's largest luggage manufacturer, began in Denver in 1910 as Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company, but Samsonite closed its NE Denver factory in 2001, and moved its headquarters to [[Massachusetts]] after a change of ownership in 2006. The [[Qwest Corporation|Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company]], founded in Denver in 1911, is now a part of telecommunications giant [[CenturyLink]].  [[MediaNews Group]] purchased the ''[[Denver Post]]'' in 1987; the company is based in Denver. The [[Gates Corporation]], the world's largest producer of automotive belts and hoses, was established in S. Denver in 1919. [[Russell Stover Candies]] Inc. made its first chocolate candy in Denver in 1923, but moved to Kansas City in 1969. The Wright & McGill Company has been making its Eagle Claw brand of fishing gear in NE Denver since 1925. The original [[Frontier Airlines (1950–1986)|Frontier Airlines]] began operations at Denver's old [[Stapleton International Airport]] in 1950. [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]] was reincarnated at [[Denver International Airport|DIA]] in 1994. Scott's Liquid Gold, Inc., has been making furniture polish in Denver since 1954. [[Village Inn]] restaurants began as a single pancake house in Denver in 1958. [[Big O Tires]], LLC, of [[Centennial, CO|Centennial]] opened its first franchise in 1962 in Denver. [[The Shane Company]] sold its first diamond jewelry in 1971 in Denver. [[Johns-Manville|Johns Manville]] Corp., a manufacturer of insulation and roofing products, relocated its headquarters to Denver from New York in 1972. [[CH2M HILL]] Inc., an engineering and construction firm, relocated from Oregon to the [[Denver Technological Center]] in 1980. The [[Ball Corporation]] sold its glass business in Indiana in the 1990s and moved to suburban [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]]. Ball has several operations in greater Denver.  [[Molson Coors Brewing Company]] established its U.S. headquarters in Denver in 2005. Its subsidiary and regional [[wholesale]] distributor, Coors Distributing Company, is in NW Denver. The [[Newmont Mining Corporation]], the 2nd largest gold producer in North America and one of the largest in the world, is headquartered in Denver.  Large Denver-area employers that have headquarters elsewhere include [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp., [[United Airlines]], [[Kroger]] Co. and [[Xcel Energy]], Inc. [http://company.mapquest.com/ MapQuest], an online site for maps, directions and business listings, is headquartered in Denver's LODO district.  Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city by virtue of its being the capital of the state of [[Colorado]]. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]], the [[Denver Federal Center]], [[Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse]], the [[Denver Mint]], and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]].  In 2005, a $310.7 million expansion for the [[Colorado Convention Center]] was completed, doubling its size. The hope was that the center's expansion would elevate the city to one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/conventioncenter/ci_0002809415 |title=Finally, it's built.

In the early days of the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the economic success of the city. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]''. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy dropped with it, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and current governor [[John Hickenlooper]], a former geologist), and the highest office vacancy rate in the nation (30%).<ref>[http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline_short.asp Denver: The Rocky Mountain Metropolis History].

[[File:University of Denver campus pics 107.jpg|thumb|left|The first Chipotle Mexican Grill near the campus of the [[University of Denver]]]] Denver's west-central geographic location in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC−7) also benefits the telecommunications industry by allowing communication with both North American coasts, South America, Europe, and Asia in the same business day. Denver's location on the 105th meridian at over one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in elevation also enables it to be the largest city in the U.S. to offer a "one-bounce" real-time satellite uplink to six continents in the same business day. [[Qwest Communications]], [[Dish Network Corporation]], [[Starz (TV network)|Starz-Encore]], [[DIRECTV]], and [[Comcast]] are a few of the many telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area.

Denver and the metropolitan areas around it continued to support culture.

Because of its proximity to the mountains and generally sunny weather, Denver has gained a reputation as being a very active, outdoor-oriented city. Many Denver residents spend the weekends in the mountains; skiing in the winter and hiking, climbing, kayaking, and camping in the summer.  Denver and surrounding cities are home to a large number of local and national breweries. Many restaurants in the region have on-site breweries, and some of the larger brewers offer tours, including [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] and [[New Belgium Brewing Company]]. The city also welcomes visitors from around the world when it hosts the annual [[Great American Beer Festival]] each fall.  Denver used to be a major trading center for beef and livestock when ranchers would drive (or later transport) cattle to the Denver Union Stockyards for sale. As a celebration of that history, for more than a century Denver has hosted the annual [[National Western Stock Show]], attracting as many as 10,000 animals and 700,000 attendees.

Denver continues to grow its park system with the development of many new parks along the Platte River through the city, and with Central Park and [[Bluff Lake Nature Center]] in the [[Stapleton International Airport|Stapleton]] neighborhood redevelopment. All of these parks are important gathering places for residents and allow what was once a dry plain to be lush, active, and green. Denver is also home to a large network of public [[community gardens]], most of which are managed by [[Denver Urban Gardens]], a non-profit organization.[[File:Dmp.JPG|thumb|[[Genesee Park (Colorado)|Genesee Park]] is the largest of the Denver Mountain Parks.]]  Since 1974, Denver and the surrounding jurisdictions have rehabilitated the urban South Platte River and its tributaries for recreational use by hikers and cyclists. The main stem of the South Platte River Greenway runs along the South Platte from [[Chatfield Dam|Chatfield Reservoir]] {{convert|35|mi|km}} into Adams County in the north.

The [[Denver City Council]] is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and is responsible for passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing, and can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver's departmental officials. All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is [[Michael Hancock (Colorado politician)|Michael Hancock]].  Denver has a strong mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any ordinances or [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, is responsible for the city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a nine out of thirteen member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.<ref>[http://www.denvergov.org/DenverCityGovernmentAnOverview/tabid/424414/Default.aspx How Denver City Government Works].

The Denver County Court is an integrated [[Colorado County Courts|Colorado County Court]] and Municipal Court and is managed by Denver instead of the state.  ===Politics=== While Denver elections are non-partisan, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have long held the majority sway on Denver politics with most officials elected citywide having Democratic Party affiliation. In federal elections, Denverites also tend to vote for Democratic candidates, voting for the Democratic Presidential nominee in every election since 1960 (excluding 1980 and 1972). The office of Denver's Mayor has been occupied by a Democrat since the municipal general election of 1963. Denver is represented at the federal level by congresswoman [[Diana DeGette]], a Democrat representing [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]], which includes all of Denver and parts of [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]].  [[Benjamin F. Stapleton]] was the mayor of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was responsible for many civic improvements during his term, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the [[New Deal]]. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed [[Stapleton International Airport]] in his honor. Today, the airport no longer stands, but has been replaced by a neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.  During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the epicenters of the [[Chicano Movement]]. The boxer-turned-activist [[Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales]] formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably, hosted the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in March 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |title=History Timeline |publisher=Chicanomoratorium.org |date= |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref>  In recent years, Denver has taken a stance on helping people who are or become [[Homelessness|homeless]], particularly under the administrations of mayors [[John Hickenlooper]] and [[Wellington Webb]].

Denver-Boulder radio is the No. 19 market in the United States, according to the Spring 2011 [http://www.arbitron.com/radio_stations/mm001050.asp Arbitron] ranking (up from No. 20 in Fall 2009). For a list of radio stations, see [[List of radio stations in Colorado|Radio Stations in Colorado]]  ===Print=== After a continued rivalry between Denver's two main newspapers, the ''[[Denver Post]]'' and ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', the papers merged operations in 2001 under a Joint Operating Agreement which formed the Denver Newspaper Agency<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvernewspaperagency.com |title= Denver Newspaper Agency|accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> until February 2009 when [[E. W. Scripps Company]], the owner of the Rocky Mountain News closed the paper. There are also several alternative or localized newspapers published in Denver, including the ''[[Westword]]'' and ''[[Out Front Colorado]]''. Denver is home to multiple regional magazines such as ''[[5280]]'', which takes its name from the city's mile-high ({{convert|5280|ft|m|0|disp=or|sp=us}}) elevation.  ==Transportation== {{wide image|Denver-skyline1.jpg|850px|The skyline of downtown Denver from the southwest}}  ===City streets=== {{Main|Street system of Denver}} [[File:Colfaxatbroadway.JPG|thumb|upright|Colfax Avenue at Broadway, where the downtown street grid and the "normal" city grid meet. Colfax Avenue carries [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 40]] through Denver.]]  Most of Denver has a straightforward [[street grid]] oriented to the four [[cardinal direction]]s. Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets, identified as "00", which are Broadway (the east–west median, running north–south) and Ellsworth Avenue (the north–south median, running east–west). [[Colfax Avenue]], a major east–west artery through Denver, is 15 blocks (1500) north of the median. Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered (with the exception of Colfax Avenue and several others, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd and Montview Blvd.), while avenues south of Ellsworth are named.  There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the [[South Platte River]] and [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]]. Most of the streets downtown and in [[LoDo]] run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]]. There is now a plaque across the street from the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]] which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after [[William Larimer, Jr.]], the founder of Denver, which is located in the heart of [[LoDo]], is the oldest street in Denver.  [[File:Speer Boulevard Denver.JPG|thumb|Speer Blvd runs north and south through downtown Denver]]  All roads in the downtown grid system are streets (e.g. [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]], Stout Street). Roads outside that system that travel east/west are given the suffix "avenue" and those that head north and south are given the "street" suffix (e.g. Colfax Avenue, Lincoln Street). Boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction (more commonly north and south). Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places, drives (though not all drives are smaller capacity roads, some are major thoroughfares) or courts. Most streets outside the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the city's center.

These are [[SH 470 (CO)|SH 470]] (also known as C-470), a freeway in the southwest Metro area, and two toll highways, [[E-470]] (from southeast to northeast) and [[Northwest Parkway]] (from terminus of E-470 to [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]]). SH 470 was originally intended to be I-470 and built with federal highway funds, but the funding was redirected to complete conversion of downtown Denver's [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]] to a pedestrian mall. As a result, construction was delayed until 1980 after state and local legislation was passed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew E. Salek |url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/denvers470.html |title=C-470?

Lamm's declared intention to drive a silver stake through it and kill it.  A highway expansion and transit project for the southern [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] corridor, dubbed T-REX ([[Transportation Expansion Project]]), was completed on November 17, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=T-REX Announces Opening Day for Southeast Light Rail Line |url=http://www.denvergov.org/Southeast_Corridor/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures2005/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures20055/tabid/393990/Default.aspx |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071013125106/http://denvergov.org:80/Southeast_Corridor/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures2005/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures20055/tabid/393990/Default.aspx |archive-date=13 October 2007 |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> The project installed wider and additional highway lanes, and improved highway access and drainage.

RTD currently operates more than 1,000 [[bus]]es serving over 10,000 bus stops in 38 municipal jurisdictions in eight counties around the [[Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area|Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas]]. Additionally, RTD operates six [[TheRide|light rail]] lines, the C, D, E, F, W, and H with a total of {{convert|34.9|mi|km}} of track, serving 36 stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtd-denver.com/LightRail/index.html |title=Light Rail |publisher=RTD Denver |accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref> [[FasTracks]] is a light rail/bus/rail expansion project approved by voters in 2004 which will serve neighboring suburbs and communities. The W line, or West line, opened in April 2013 serving Golden/Federal Center. Currently, RTD is expanding the rail through Aurora along I-225 and building a commuter line along I-70 to connect Downtown with Stapleton and the Denver International Airport.  [[Colorado Department of Transportation|CDOT]] runs a bus system named Bustang that offers weekday service between Union Station in Denver, [[Glenwood Springs]], [[Colorado Springs]], and [[Fort Collins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27921710/cdots-statewide-bustang-service-to-start-july-13 |title=Bustang Start |publisher= Denver Post|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref>  [[Greyhound Lines]], the [[intercity bus]] operator, has a major hub in Denver, with routes to [[New York City]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Las Vegas]], and their headquarters, [[Dallas]]. Subsidiary [[Autobuses Americanos]] provides service to [[El Paso]]. Allied bus operators Black Hills Trailways, and [[Burlington Trailways]] provide service to [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]].  [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' daily in both directions between [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California, across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points.  At Albuquerque, New Mexico, Denver Thruway connections are made daily with the Amtrak ''[[Southwest Chief]]''. Additionally, the [[Ski Train]] operated on the former [[Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad]], which took passengers between Denver and the [[Winter Park, Colorado|Winter Park]] Ski Resort, but it is no longer in service. The Ski Train made its final run to Winter Park on March 29, 2009.  Denver's early years as a major train hub of the west are still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at historic [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]], where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]] will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, at the completion of [[FasTracks]].  ===Airports=== [[File:Denver International Airport terminal.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the main terminal of [[Denver International Airport]]]] [[File:Denver International Airport.jpg|thumb|Outside view of the main terminal, DIA]]  [[Denver International Airport]] (IATA: DEN, ICAO: KDEN), commonly known as DIA, serves as the primary airport for a large region surrounding Denver.

In the past, Denver has been home to several other airports that are no longer operational. [[Stapleton International Airport]] was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. [[Lowry Air Force Base]] was a military flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with the base finally being closed in 1994. It is currently being used for residential purposes. [[Buckley Air Force Base]], a former [[Air National Guard]] base, is currently the only military facility in the Denver-Metro area.  ==Notable people== {{Main|List of people from Denver}}  ==Sister cities== {{Main|Sister cities of Denver}}  Denver's relationship with [[Brest, France]], began in 1948, making it the second-oldest [[sister city]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://denversistercities.org/brest/#tab-2 |title=Brest France |publisher=Denver Sister Cities International |accessdate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref>  Since then, Denver has established relationships with additional sister cities, and currently has a total of ten partnerships:<ref>{{cite web|title=Denver Sister Cities International|url=http://denversistercities.org/|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}</ref>  *[[Brest, France|Brest]], France, (1948) *[[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]], Japan (1960) *[[Nairobi]], Kenya (1975) *[[Karmiel]], Israel (1977) *[[Cuernavaca]], Mexico (1983) *[[Potenza]], Italy (1983) *[[Chennai]], India (1984) *[[Kunming]], China (1985) *[[Axum]], Ethiopia (1995) *[[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia (2001)  In addition to these, the [[Denver Regional Council of Governments]] (consisting of the city and 51 other local governments) has established a "sister city" relationship with the [[Baghdad Governorate]], one of [[Iraq]]'s eighteen provinces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baghdad-Denver Region Partnership|url=http://www.drcog.org/index.cfm?page=InternationalPartnersforPeace|publisher=Denver Regional Council of Governments|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}</ref>  ==See also== {{Wikivoyage|Denver}} {{portal|Colorado|United States|North America|Geography}} *[[Arapahoe County, Colorado]] *[[Arapahoe County, Colorado Territory]] *[[Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory]] *[[Arrappahoe County, Jefferson Territory]] *[[Colorado metropolitan areas]] *[[Front Range Urban Corridor]] *[[Gang activity in Denver]] *[[Historic Colorado counties]] *[[List of cities and towns in Colorado]] *[[List of counties in Colorado]] *[[List of mayors of Denver]] *[[List of neighborhoods in Denver]] *[[List of people from Denver]] *[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Denver, Colorado]] *[[New Denver, British Columbia]] *[[North Central Colorado Urban Area]] *[[Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant]] *[[State of Colorado]]  ==Notes== {{notelist}}  ==References== {{Reflist|30em}}  ==External links== {{sister project links|commons=Category:Denver, Colorado|v=no|n=no|q=no|b=no|voy=Denver}} * [http://www.denvergov.org/ City and County of Denver website] ** [http://www.dot.state.co.us/App_DTD_DataAccess/Downloads/CityMaps/Denver.pdf CDOT map of the City and County of Denver] ** [http://www.denvergov.org/Police/ Denver Police Department] ** [http://denverlibrary.org/ Denver Public Library] ** [http://www.dpsk12.org/ Denver Public Schools] * [http://www.historycolorado.org/ History Colorado website] * [http://www.rtd-denver.com/ Regional Transportation District website] * {{osmrelation|253750}}  {{Navboxes | title = Articles relating to the City and County of Denver | list = {{Denver}} {{Neighborhoods of Denver}} {{Colorado}} {{United States state capitals}} {{Colorado cities and mayors of 100,000 population}} }}  {{Authority control}}  [[Category:Denver, Colorado| ]] [[Category:Cities in Colorado]] [[Category:Colorado counties]] [[Category:Denver metropolitan area]] [[Category:County seats in Colorado]] [[Category:Consolidated city-counties in the United States]] [[Category:Populated places established in 1858]] [[Category:1858 establishments in Kansas Territory]]
