    Ian Michael Chappell (born 26 September 1943) is a former cricketer who played for South Australia and Australia.  He captained Australia between 1971 and 1975 before taking a central role in the breakaway World Series Cricket organisation. Born into a cricketing family—his grandfather and brother also captained Australia—Chappell made a hesitant start to international cricket playing as a right-hand middle-order batsman and spin bowler. He found his niche when promoted to bat at number three. Known as "Chappelli", he earned a reputation as one of the greatest captains the game has seen.MCG biography: Ian Chappell.

Chappell's blunt verbal manner led to a series of confrontations with opposition players and cricket administrators; the issue of sledging first arose during his tenure as captain and he was a driving force behind the professionalisation of Australian cricket in the 1970s.Cashman et al.

An animated presence at the batting crease, he constantly adjusted his equipment and clothing, and restlessly tapped his bat on the ground as the bowler ran in. Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons, Chappell employed the drive and square cut to full effect. He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of mid on,Simpson (1996), p 54. but his trademark shot was the hook, famously saying "three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me".p37, David Gower, Heroes and Contemporaries, Granada Publishing Ltd, 1985 A specialist slip fielder, he was the fourth player to take one hundred Test catches. Since his retirement in 1980, he has pursued a high-profile career as a sports journalist and cricket commentator, predominantly with Channel Nine.

Chappell grew up in the beachside suburb of Glenelg and attended the local St Leonard's Primary School where he played his first competitive match at the age of seven. He was later selected for the South Australian state schoolboys team.Mallett (2005), p 11. He then enrolled at Prince Alfred College, a private secondary school noted for producing many Test cricketers, including the Australian captains Joe Darling and Clem Hill.

Chappell replaced West Indian Gary Sobers who was selected for a Test match in the Caribbean.Chappell (1976), p 39. The aggressive style of Sobers and SA captain Les Favell heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in major cricket.Chappell (1976), pp 40–41. In 1962–63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a New South Wales team led by Australian captain Richie Benaud, who was bemused by the young batsman's habit of gritting his teeth as he faced up; to Benaud, it looked as if he was grinning.Mallett (2005), p 20.

Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips, and he showed promise as a leg-spinner. At this point, the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all-rounder: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match. He retained his place for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression.

On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal.Mallett (2005), p 26. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode his luck to score 151 – his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take. However, in the remainder of the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form. In England, Chappell rewarded the faith of the selectors by scoring the most first-class runs on the tour (1,261 runs, including 202 not out against Warwickshire), leading the Australian Test aggregates with 348 runs (at 43.50).Mallett (2005), p 30.

Chappell was elevated to number three in the batting order and became a less-frequent bowler; he was also appointed vice-captain of the team. Following up with a successful tour of India in late 1969, Chappell demonstrated his fluency against spin bowling by compiling Test innings of 138 at Delhi and 99 at Kolkata.

The South African authorities requested that an extra Test be added to the fixture and the Australian Board of Control consented.

Chappell gained some consolation at the end of a dramatic summer when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield, the team's first win for seven years.Mallett (2005), p 55. Chappell's battles against the short-pitched bowling of Snow during the season compelled him to reappraise his game. Following a conversation with Sir Donald Bradman, he decided to reinstate the hook shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg.Chappell (1976), pp 74–75. Although he still regularly lost his wicket after playing the shot, Chappell felt that the psychological benefit of showing aggression to opposing bowlers offset the times that he was dismissed for a low score. Australia lost an unofficial Test series to a Rest of the World team led by Gary Sobers that toured in 1971–72 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans.Harte (1993), p 532–533.

On this tour, the behaviour of the team was questioned with some journalists labelling them "ugly Australians". In 1976, Chappell wrote about his attitude to the opposition: ... although we didn't deliberately set out to be a 'bunch of bastards' when we walked on to the field, I'd much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as 'a nice bunch of blokes on the field.' As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple: between 11.00am and 6.00pm there was no time to be a nice guy. I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team, to themselves and to winning; in other words, playing hard and fairly within the rules. To my mind, doing all that left no time for being a nice guy.Chappell (1976), p 33. The increasing prevalence of verbal confrontation on the field (later known as sledging) concerned cricket administrators and became a regular topic for the media.Harte (1993), Chapter 28. Its instigation is sometimes attributed to Chappell. By his own admission, he was a frequent user of profanity who was often at "boiling point" on the field, but claims that the various incidents he was involved in were not a premeditated tactic.

As Australian captain, he made several unsuccessful representations at ACB meetings in an effort to secure a more realistic financial deal for the Australian players. In consultations with the then-president of the ACTU, Bob Hawke, he explored the possibility of unionising the players.Harte (1993), p 561. Approached to lead an Australian team in World Series Cricket (WSC), a breakaway professional competition organised by Kerry Packer for Channel Nine, Chappell signed a three-year contract worth A$75,000 in 1976.Mallett (2005), p 156. His participation was, "fundamental to the credibility of the enterprise". Chappell devised the list of Australian players to be signed, and was involved in the organisation and marketing of WSC. His central role was the result of, "years of personal disaffection with cricket officialdom", in  particular Don Bradman. Recently, Chappell wrote: While captaining Australia, I was approached on three separate occasions before WSC to play 'professional' cricket, and each time I advised the entrepreneurs to meet the appropriate cricket board because they controlled the grounds. On each occasion, the administrators sent the entrepreneurs packing and it quickly became clear they weren't interested in a better deal for the players. That's why I say the players didn't stab the ACB in the back. The administrators had numerous opportunities to reach a compromise but displayed little interest in the welfare of the players. It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money. In WSC's debut season of 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and finished fifth in overall averages.Cricket Archive: WSC Supertests 1977–78. Retrieved 13 November 2007. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling and a serious injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell was one of the many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC.

During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory.Haigh (1993), pp 255–256. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979.

Chappell's aggressive approach suited limited-overs cricket: he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 77 runs per hundred balls.

As captain, he recorded six wins and five losses from 11 matches. He is also credited to have hit the first ever six in an ODI match (which is in fact the first ODI match ever played). The title of the ABC's documentary The Chappell Era, broadcast in 2002, encapsulated Chappell's significance to Australian cricket. Subtitled Cricket in the '70s, it chronicled the rise of the Australian cricket team under Chappell, the fight for better pay for the players, and professionalisation of the game through WSC. During the program, Chappell reiterated his criticisms of cricket's administration at the time. In Wisden, Richie Benaud wrote, "Chappell will be remembered as much for his bid to improve the players' lot as he will for his run-getting and captaincy". During the WSC period, he founded a players' association with a loan provided by Kerry Packer. Despite Chappell's continued support for the organisation after his retirement, apathy and a lack of recognition from the ACB led to its demise in 1988.Harte (1993), p 610.

Chappell showed no fraternal bias and was vehement in his criticism of his brother Greg's tactic. He wrote in a newspaper column on the matter: "Fair dinkum, Greg, how much pride do you sacrifice to win $35,000?"McGregor (1985), p 209. He supported the claims of Rod Marsh to the Australian captaincy over the incumbent, Kim Hughes, in the early 1980s. The constant campaign against Hughes destabilised his authority. Compounding the situation, the ACB compelled Hughes to be interviewed by Chappell on a regular basis. During the 1981 Ashes, Ian Chappell introduced an interview between Hughes and Richie Benaud by claiming the Australian captain was "thought of that dumb so and so who couldn't run a bath and who keeps getting caught at deep fine leg.""3-Up had Chappell Toured, Says Kim" Sydney Morning Herald, 9 August 1981 accessed 27 March 2014 He also criticised Hughes' batting. "Hughes needs to score the runs when they are needed most. He is not doing this and his inconsistency is rubbing off on others... there is a not a lot of thought in his batting"Russel Eldridge, Sydney Morning Herald 10 August 1981 accessed 27 March 1981 At the beginning of the 1983–84 summer when Hughes was appointed captain of the Australian time at home for the first time since 1979 Chappell said "I guess it is now time for Hughes to put up or shut up."Russel Eldridge, "What Test Crickets Greats Say", Sydney Morning Herald, 3 November 1983 accessed 27 March 2014 On the morning of the second test against the West Indies in 1984–85 Chappell asked Hughes ""Three months ago, you claimed Australia possessed no Test-worthy legspinner. So what is Bob Holland doing in the team?"Alex Malcolm, "Burnished and tarnished", Cricinfo 8 March 2009 accessed 16 March 2014 Hughes resigned as captain after that match.Chloe Saltau, "A captain's long, lonely walk:, The Age 26 November 2004 accessed 16 March 2014 Following Hughes' resignation, Australian cricket went into turmoil and Chappell received a share of the blame for the outcome.The crying game. Cricinfo. Retrieved 12 October 2007. Chappell had a direct influence on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist.Buchanan tells Simpson to stay with the times. Cricinfo. Retrieved 15 October 2007. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided the need for a coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.Simpson (1996), pp 205–206. Chappell believed that the Border-Simpson leadership was too defensive and that Simpson usurped too much of Border's control of the team; Border heeded Chappell's assessment and adopted a more aggressive on-field approach later in his career and became known as "Captain Grumpy" to his team mates.Savour dominance — Border The Age. Retrieved 23 October 2007. Mark Taylor, who captained the team after Border, moved to dilute Simpson's authority. Chappell remains a long-standing critic of the use of coaches by national teams.Rediff: Interview — Ian Chappell. Retrieved 2 October 2006. Ian Chappell was often critical of Steve Waugh as captain, believing him to be a selfish player and unimaginative captain. When Waugh was appointed captain in 1999 Chappell said: I think he's been a selfish cricketer . . . I've always felt that the things you do as a player leading up to getting the captaincy do have an effect [on] how players perceive you. I've had the feeling that a selfish player when he becomes captain . . . gets a little less out of his players than someone who is not selfish."Old boys still cool on the Iceman", Sydney Morning Herald, 10 May 2003 accessed 16 March 2014 Chappell felt Shane Warne should have been picked as captain instead and his criticism of Waugh's captaincy did not abate during Waugh's stint in that role, despite his success. Waugh later wrote of Chappell: Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and reported them with an 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he was never going to cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.Will Swanton, "Waugh 'betrayed' in Caribbean", The Age, 23 October 2005 accessed 16 March 2014 Chappell rated Ricky Ponting a better captain than Waugh."Ian Chappell rates Ponting higher than Waugh", Cricinfo 13 May 2010 accessed 16 March 2014 Chappell has been a vocal critic of a number of Australian players, most recently Ed Cowan and George Bailey.Jarrod Kimber, "George Who?", Cricinfo, 14 March 2014 accessed 15 March 2014Ian Chappell, "Ian Chappell believes Australian selectors must look past runs and leave George Bailey out of Ashes", The Daily Telegraph 3 November 2013 accessed 16 March 2014Peter Badel, "Ed Cowan hits back at Ian Chappell", Daily Telegraph 16 March 2013 accessed 16 March 2014 When the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks met in Major League Baseball's season opening series at the Sydney Cricket Groundin Sydney on 22 and 23 March 2014, Chappell, who had represented South Australia as a catcher in the Claxton Shield before embarking on his successful cricket career, was a commentator for the broadcasts, carried on Australia's Channel Nine and in the United States by MLB Network. He worked with Matt Vasgersian and former Cy Young Award winner John Smoltz. Chappell's first book was an account of the 1972 Ashes tour, Tigers Among the Lions, followed by a series of books of cricketing humour and anecdotes published in the early 1980s. The more analytical The Cutting Edge, an appraisal of modern cricket, appeared in 1992. Ashley Mallett's biography, Chappelli Speaks Out (published in the UK as Hitting Out – the Ian Chappell Story) was written in collaboration with Chappell and released in 2005. It caused controversy due to Chappell's assessment of Steve Waugh, who he described as "selfish" and as a captain, "ran out of ideas very quickly".Mallett (2005), chapter 13. Waugh responded by writing, "to say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement." He categorised the criticisms as "personal" and noted that Chappell, "always sweated on my blunders and reported them with an 'I told you so' mentality".Waugh 'betrayed' in the Caribbean. The Age.

After leaving school, Chappell spent two years as a clerk in a sharebroker's office, which he left to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a promotions representative for Nestlé and, later, the cigarette manufacturer WD & HO Wills. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession.Chappell (1976), p 47. He is twice married, and has a daughter (Amanda) with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with his second wife Barbara-Ann.
