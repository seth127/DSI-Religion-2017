    Des Moines  is the capital and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is also the county seat of Polk County. A small portion of the city extends into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines which was shortened to "Des Moines" in 1857. It is named after the Des Moines River, which may have been adapted from the French Rivière des Moines, meaning "River of the Monks". The city's population was 203,433 as of the 2010 census. The five-county metropolitan area is ranked 91st in terms of population in the United States with 599,789 residents according to the 2013 estimate by the United States Census Bureau. Des Moines is a major center of the U.S. insurance industry and has a sizable financial services and publishing business base. In fact, Des Moines was credited as the "number one spot for U.S. insurance companies" in a Business Wire article and named the third largest "insurance capital" of the world. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group, Athene USA insurance, the Meredith Corporation, Ruan Transportation, EMC Insurance Companies, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Marsh, Monsanto and Pioneer Hi-Bred have large operations in or near the metro area. In recent years Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Facebook have established data processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines metro.  Forbes magazine ranked Des Moines as the "Best Place for Business" in both 2010 and 2013.  In 2014, NBC ranked Des Moines as the "Wealthiest City in America" according to its criteria.http://www.today.com/money/des-moines-where-regular-folks-can-live-rich-life-2D11965288 Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics because it is the capital of Iowa, which is home to the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Hence, many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in The New York Times stated "if you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines". Des Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the Des Moines River. The French "des Moines" (pronounced , formerly ) translates literally to either "from the monks" or "of the monks". The historian Virgil Vogel claimed that "Moingona" was derived from the Algonquian clan name "Loon".Vogel, Virgil (1983) Iowa Place Names of Indian Origin University of Iowa Press, Iowa City. Some historians and researchers lacking linguistic or Algonquianist training concluded that Moingona meant "people by the portage" or something similar, a reference to the Des Moines Rapids, where the earliest meetings between the Moingona and European explorers took place. One popular interpretation of "Des Moines" ignores Vogel's research, and concludes that "Des Moines" refers to French Trappist monks, who lived in huts on top of what is now known as Monks Mound near St. Louis some  from the Des Moines River."Defining 'Des Moines'", Des Moines Register, September 14, 2003. A controversial recent hypothesis using a study of Miami-Illinois tribal names concludes the word Moingona comes from mooyiiinkweena, a derogatory name which translates roughly to "the excrement-faces". The name was apparently given to Marquette and Joliet by a tribal leader to dissuade them from doing business with a neighboring tribe."Is 'Des Moines' just some dirty joke?", Des Moines Register, September 14, 2003.  The juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified in downtown Des Moines by archaeologists. Discovered in December 2010, the "Palace" is an expansive 7,000-year-old site located at the new wastewater treatment plant in southeastern Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by the University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig. At least three Late Prehistoric villages stood in or near downtown Des Moines, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric American Indian mounds were observed in downtown Des Moines by early settlers. All have been destroyed. The City of Des Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the [[U.S. War Department]] told him to name it Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] Indians, who had been transplanted to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state.<ref name="Forts">{{cite book|last=Schoen|first=Christopher M. |author2=W.E. Whittaker |author3=K.E.M.

The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems.

On May 25, 1846, Fort Des Moines became the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850–1851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:  <blockquote>This is one of the strangest looking "cities" I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of "brick", and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses...The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops.

In 1857, the name "Fort Des Moines" was shortened to "Des Moines" and the state capital was moved here from [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]].

Its first mine, north of town on the west side of the river, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sunk a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] to reach a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} coal bed.

By 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408 making it Iowa's largest city, and displacing the three Mississippi River ports (Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport) that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period.  Des Moines has remained Iowa's most populous city ever since.

This form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a [[council-manager]] government, and further changed in 1967 so that four of the seven city council members were elected by ward rather than at-large. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960). The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009.<ref name="citypop">{{cite web|publisher=United States Census Bureau|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places in Iowa: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2009-04-19.xls|format=XLS|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> However, the growth of the outlying suburbs has been a constant and the overall metro area population is over 600,000 today.  During the [[Great Flood of 1993]], heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by flood waters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days.

The [[World Food Prize]] Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed restoration of the [[Public Library of Des Moines|former Des Moines Public Library]] building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Dr. [[Norman Borlaug]]/[[World Food Prize]] Hall of Laureates.  In 2002, the Principal Financial Group and the city announced plans for the [[Principal Riverwalk]], which will feature trails, pedestrian bridges across the river, a fountain and skating plaza, and a "civic garden" in front of the City Hall.

In 2014, Jonathan Gano was appointed as the new Public Works Director.<ref>http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/des-moines/2014/12/31/jonathan-gano-des-moines-public-works/21099603</ref>  In 2015, Dana Wingert was appointed as Police Chief<ref>http://www.kcci.com/news/des-moines-officials-reach-decision-on-new-police-chief/31093674</ref> and Pam Cooksey was appointed as the new City Engineer.<ref>http://www.dmgov.org/NewsDocuments/20150127CityOfDesMoinesNamesPamelaCookseyAsCityEngineer.pdf</ref>  A plan to merge the governments of Des Moines and Polk County was rejected by voters during the November 2, 2004, election. The [[consolidated city-county]] government would have had a full-time mayor and a 15-member council that would have been divided among the city and its suburbs. Each suburb would have still retained its individual government but had the option to join the consolidated government at any time. Although a full merger was soundly rejected, many city and county departments and programs have been consolidated.  ==Transportation== [[File:I235 keynote bridge.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Edna Griffin|Edna M. Griffin]] Memorial Pedestrian Bridge over [[Interstate 235 (Iowa)|Interstate 235]].]]  Des Moines has an extensive skywalk system within its downtown core. With over four miles of enclosed walkway, it is one of the largest of such systems in the United States. The Des Moines Skywalk System has been criticized for hurting street-level business, though a recent initiative has been made to make street-level Skywalk entrances more visible. [[File:Skywalks Spanning 7th Street.jpg|left|thumb|Skywalks connecting buildings over 8th Street in the Downtown Core of Des Moines]] [[Interstate 235 (Iowa)|Interstate 235]] (I-235) cuts through the city, and [[Interstate 35 in Iowa|I-35]] and [[Interstate 80 in Iowa|I-80]] both pass through the Des Moines metropolitan area, as well as the city of Des Moines. On the northern side of the city of Des Moines and passing through the cities of Altoona, Clive, Johnston, Urbandale and West Des Moines, I-35 and I-80 converge into a long concurrency while I-235 takes a direct route through Des Moines, Windsor Heights, and West Des Moines before meeting up with I-35 and I-80 on the western edge of the metro.  Des Moines' freeway design makes it easy for travelers. A motorist who misses an exit at the interstate "mixmasters" at the eastern and western edges of the metro eventually ends up at the convergence of the same interstates at the opposite side of the metro. These Interstates include I-35, I-80, and I-235. I-235, which takes the brunt of most congestion, is six lanes throughout the entire length and expands to eight and ten lanes near the downtown area. The remainder of traffic congestion in the area occurs near the East and West Mixmasters on either side of Des Moines. I-35 south of the West Mixmaster is currently being widened to six lanes all the way to the [[Iowa Highway 5]] (Iowa&nbsp;5) bypass interchanges.  Due to increasing budget constraints, the city of Des Moines implemented a speeding camera program along I-235 to gain revenue through the most densely populated parts of Greater Des Moines. The East Mixmaster has also undergone a redesign with wider lanes and redesign of bridges allowing easier traffic flow in all directions along I-35, I-80, and I-235. [[U.S. Highway 65 (Iowa)|U.S. Highway 65]] (US&nbsp;65) and Iowa&nbsp;5 form a freeway loop, known as the "South Belt Freeway," to the east and south of the city, providing a route through the southern part of the metropolitan area. [[U.S. Route 6 in Iowa|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 69 in Iowa|US&nbsp;69]], [[Iowa Highway 28|Iowa&nbsp;28]], [[Iowa Highway 141|Iowa&nbsp;141]], [[Iowa Highway 163|Iowa&nbsp;163]], [[Iowa Highway 330|Iowa&nbsp;330]],and [[Iowa Highway 415|Iowa&nbsp;415]] are also important routes to and within the city.  [[File:Downtown Des Moines Skywalk Entrance.jpg|thumb|A new Des Moines Skywalk Entrance]] There have been proposals to convert Iowa&nbsp;5 and US&nbsp;65, the "South Belt Freeway," into what would be renamed Interstate 335, giving the Des Moines Metropolitan Area an interstate running from the northeast suburb of [[Altoona, IA|Altoona]] to the southeastern suburb of [[Carlisle, IA|Carlisle]] and then connect with I-35 in the southern part of [[West Des Moines, IA|West Des Moines]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New Interstate 335 Coming to DM Area? |url=http://www.kcci.com/automotive/27825552/detail.html |publisher=KCCI News Channel 8 |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120120103449/http://www.kcci.com/automotive/27825552/detail.html |archivedate=20 January 2012 }}</ref>  [[File:Original Skywalk Entrance Sign.jpg|left|thumb|An original Des Moines Skywalk Entrance]] Des Moines's public transit system, operated by DART ([[Des Moines Area Regional Transit]]), which was the Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority until October 2006, consists entirely of buses, including regular in-city routes and express and commuter buses to outlying suburban areas. A light rail tram system has been proposed, but is years away and dependent on finding funding.  [[Burlington Trailways]], [[Jefferson Lines]], and [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] run long-distance, inter-city bus routes through Des Moines. The nearest [[Amtrak]] train station is in [[Osceola, Iowa|Osceola]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of Des Moines. Trains on the route that passes through [[Osceola (Amtrak station)|Osceola]], the [[California Zephyr]], go east to Chicago, Illinois, and west to [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California. There are plans to establish regional service Between Chicago and Omaha directly serving Des Moines. There may also be connections to Osceola and Waterloo. The Rock Island perviously served Des Moines with its Rocket streamlined trains.  The [[Des Moines International Airport]] (DSM), located on Fleur Drive in the southern part of Des Moines, offers nonstop service to destinations within the United States.
