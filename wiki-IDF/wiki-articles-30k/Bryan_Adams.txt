Adams was born in Kingston, Ontario, to British parents, Elizabeth Jane (née Watson) and Capt. Conrad J. Adams, who migrated to Canada from England in the 1950s. Adams' father, a Sandhurst officer in the British Army, joined the Canadian Army and later spent time as a United Nations peacekeeping observer for Canada, which led to him becoming a Canadian foreign service diplomat. Adams traveled with his parents to diplomatic postings in Portugal and Vienna, Austria, during the 1960s, and to Israel during the early 1970s. Adams has a brother, Bruce. At the age of 14, Adams worked as a dish washer to save money for a guitar. He started auditioning as a guitarist while rehearsing his own band in his mother's rented basement in North Vancouver. Adams elected to sing until they found a singer, but they never found one. He quit school after his auditions got him jobs to go on the road and play underage in nightclubs with bar bands like Shock and a short stint with pub band Sweeney Todd, who in 1976 released If Wishes Were Horses with the 15-year-old Adams as the singer.http://www.discogs.com/artist/816901-Sweeney-Todd By age 17, Adams had quit touring and started working in the Vancouver studio scene, working as a background vocalist for the CBC and backing local artists and with Motown keyboardist Robbie King, whom Adams attributes as having given him his first ever paying session. In 1978, at the age of 18, Adams met Jim Vallance introduced by a mutual friend in a Vancouver music store. Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter. They agreed to meet at Vallance's home studio a few days later, which proved to be the beginning of a partnership which still exists today. Later in 1978, Adams signed to A&M records for one dollar.Saidman, page 47 Some of the first demos written in 1978 have surfaced over the years, most notably "I'm Ready" (recorded for both the album Cuts Like a Knife and later his release for MTV Unplugged) and "Remember," which was recorded on his first album. Both songs were covered by other artists even before his first album was released. Also recorded during this time was the disco song "Let Me Take You Dancing," which made the Canadian RPM chart in March 1979 and its B-Side "Don't Turn Me Away". "Straight From The Heart" was also written during this period. The song was later recorded for Adams's third album "Cuts Like A Knife" in 1983 and released as a single, becoming Adams's first top ten record in the U.S. in 1983. Adams's self-titled debut album was released in February 1980, and marked the beginning of what was to become a long songwriting partnership between Adams and co-writer Jim Vallance. With the exception of "Remember" and "Wastin' Time", most of the album was recorded from 29 October up until 29 November 1979 at Manta Studios in Toronto and co-produced by Adams and Vallance. The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986. Adams's second album, You Want It You Got It, was recorded in New York City in two weeks and it marked Adams's first album co-produced by Bob Clearmountain.
