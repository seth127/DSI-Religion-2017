   Trichinosis, trichinellosis or trichiniasis is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of the genus Trichinella. Several subspecies cause human disease, but T. spiralis is the most known. Infection may occur without symptoms, while intestinal invasion can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain or vomiting. Larval migration into muscle tissue (one week after being infected) can cause edema of the face or around the eyes, conjunctivitis, fever, muscle pains, splinter hemorrhages, [[rash]]es<nowiki/>, and [[Eosinophilia|peripheral eosinophilia]].<ref name=":1"/> Life-threatening cases can result in [[myocarditis]], [[central nervous system]] involvement, and [[pneumonitis]].<ref name=":1"/> Larval encystment in the muscles causes pain and [[muscle weakness|weakness]], followed by slow progression of symptoms.<ref name=":1"/>  Trichinosis is mainly caused by eating undercooked meat containing encysted larval ''Trichinella''.<ref name=":1"/> In the stomach the larvae are exposed to [[gastric acid|stomach acid]] and [[pepsin]] which releases them from their cysts.

As the larvae migrate through tissue and vessels, the body's inflammatory response results in [[edema]], muscle pain, fever, and weakness.

Pigs become infected when they eat infectious cysts in raw meat, often pork or rats ([[sylvatic cycle]]). Humans become infected when they eat raw or undercooked infected pork ([[domestic cycle]]). After humans ingest the [[cyst]]s from infected undercooked meat, pepsin and hydrochloric acid help free the larvae in the cysts in the stomach.<ref name=five>Capo, V. & Despommier, D. D. (1996). Clinical Aspects of Infection with ''Trichinella spp.'' Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 9, 47–54.</ref> The larvae then migrate to the small intestine, where they molt four times before becoming adults.<ref name=five/>  Thirty to 34 hours after the cysts were originally ingested, the adults mate, and within five days produce larvae.<ref name="five"/> The worms can only reproduce for a limited time because the immune system will eventually expel them from the small intestine.<ref name="five"/> The larvae then use their piercing mouthpart, called the "stylet", to pass through the intestinal mucosa and enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the bloodstream.<ref name="four"/>  The larvae travel by capillaries to various organs, such as the retina, myocardium, or lymph nodes; however, only larvae that migrate to [[skeletal muscle]] cells survive and encyst.<ref name="two"/> The larval host cell becomes a [[nurse cell]] in which the larvae will be encapsulated. The development of a capillary network around the nurse cell completes encystation of the larvae.  ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis of trichinosis is confirmed by a combination of exposure history, clinical diagnosis, and laboratory testing.  ===Exposure history=== An epidemiological investigation can be done to determine a patient's exposure to raw infected meat. Often, an infection arises from home-preparation of contaminated meat, in which case microscopy can be used to determine the infection. However, exposure does not have to be directly from an infected animal. Other exposure includes the consumption of products from a laboratory-confirmed infected animal or by sharing a common exposure as a laboratory-confirmed infected human.<ref name=two>Gottstein B, et al.

"NSS NRTE/RTE Establishment Responsibilities." (2006).</ref>  ===Education and training=== Public education about the dangers of consuming raw and undercooked meat, especially pork, may reduce infection rates. Hunters are also an at-risk population due to their contact and consumption of wild game, including bear. As such, many states, such as New York, require the completion of a course in such matters before a hunting license can be obtained.<ref>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation – Hunting Licenses <www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6094.html></ref>  ===Food preparation=== Larvae may be killed by the heating or [[Food irradiation|irradiation]] of raw meat. Freezing is only usually effective for ''T. spiralis'', since other species, such as ''T. nativa'', are freeze resistant and can survive long-term freezing.<ref name="two"/>  *All [[meat]] (including pork) can be safely prepared by cooking to an internal temperature of {{convert|165|F}} or higher for 15 seconds or more. *Wild game: Wild game meat must be cooked thoroughly (see [[meat]] preparation above) Freezing wild game does not kill all trichinosis larval worms. This is because the worm species that typically infests wild game can resist freezing. *[[Pork]]: Freezing cuts of pork less than 6&nbsp;inches thick for 20 days at 5&nbsp;°F (−15&nbsp;°C) or three days at −4&nbsp;°F (−20&nbsp;°C) kills ''T. spiralis'' larval worms; but this will not kill other trichinosis larval worm species, such as ''T. nativa'', if they have infested the pork food supply (which is unlikely).

This vaccine significantly increased CD4+ cells and increased antigen-specific serum IgGq and IgA, resulting in a statistically significant reduction in the average number of adult worms in the small intestine of mice. The significance of this approach is that if the white blood cells in the small intestine have been exposed to ''Trichinella'' antigens (through vaccination) then, when an individual gets infected, the immune system will respond to expel the worms from the small intestine fast enough to prevent the female worms from releasing their larvae.

The incidence of trichinosis in the U.S. has decreased dramatically in the past century. From 1997 to 2001, an annual average of 12 cases per year were reported in the United States. The number of cases has decreased because of legislation prohibiting the feeding of raw meat garbage to hogs, increased commercial and home freezing of pork, and the public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked pork products.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/trichinosis/factsht_trichinosis.htm |title=Trichinellosis Fact Sheet – Division of Parasitic Diseases  |publisher=Centre for Disease Control, US Government |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-02-25 }} </ref>  In the [[Third World|developing world]], most infections are associated with undercooked pork. For example, in [[Thailand]], between 200 and 600 cases are reported annually around the [[Thai New Year]]. This is mostly attributable to a particular delicacy, ''[[larb]]'', which calls for undercooked pork as part of the recipe. In parts of Eastern Europe, the World Health Organization ([[WHO]]) reports some swine herds have trichinosis infection rates above 50%, and there are correspondingly large numbers of human infections. [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic612.htm]  === United States === Historically, pork products were thought to have the most risk of infecting humans with [[Trichinella spiralis]]. However, a trichinosis surveillance conducted between 1997-2001  showed a higher percentage of cases caused by consumption of wild game. This is thought to be due to the Federal Swine Health Protection Act (Public Law 96-468) that was passed by Congress in 1980. Before this act swine were fed garbage that could potentially be infected by [[Trichinella spiralis]]. This act was put in place to prevent contaminated food from being given to swine. Additionally, other regulations were put in place such as  rodent control, limiting commercial swines contact with wildlife,  maintaining good hygiene, and removing dead pigs from pens immediately.<ref>Roy, Sharon, Adriana Lopez, and Peter Schantz.

In 1835, [[James Paget]], a first-year medical student, first observed the larval form of ''T. spiralis'' while witnessing an autopsy at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. Paget took special interest in the presentation of muscle with white flecks, described as a "sandy diaphragm".  Although Paget is most likely the first person to have noticed and recorded these findings, the parasite was named and published in a report by his professor, [[Richard Owen]], who is now credited for the discovery of the ''T. spiralis'' larval form.<ref name=four>Cook GC, "Outbreak of trichinosis (trichiniasis)—contracted in London in 1879" Postgrad Med J 2001;77:62–63</ref><ref>Richard Owen (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bh0zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q&f=false "Description of a microscopic entozoon infesting the muscles of the human body,"] ''Transactions of the Zoological Society of London'', '''1''' :  315–324.
