  The University of Houston (UH) is a state research university and the flagship institution of the University of Houston&nbsp;System. Founded in 1927, UH is the  university in Texas with nearly 43,000 students. Its campus spans 667 acres in southeast Houston, and was known as University of Houston–University Park from 1983 to 1991. The Carnegie Foundation classifies UH as a comprehensive doctoral degree-granting institution with very high research activity.   The U.S. News & World Report ranks the university No.&nbsp;187 in its National University Rankings, and No.&nbsp;105 among top public universities. The university offers more than 280 degree programs through its 12 academic colleges on campus—including programs leading to professional degrees in law, optometry, and pharmacy.  The institution conducts nearly $130&nbsp;million annually in research, and operates more than 40 research centers and institutes on campus. Interdisciplinary research includes superconductivity, space commercialization and exploration, biomedical sciences and engineering, energy and natural resources, and artificial intelligence. Awarding more than 9,000 degrees annually, UH's alumni base exceeds 260,000. The economic impact of the university contributes over $3&nbsp;billion annually to the Texas economy, while generating about 24,000 jobs. The University of Houston hosts a variety of theatrical performances, concerts, lectures, and events. It has more than 400 student organizations and 17 intercollegiate sports teams. Annual UH events and traditions include The Cat's Back, Homecoming, and Frontier&nbsp;Fiesta. The university's varsity athletic teams, known as the Houston&nbsp;Cougars, are members of the American Athletic Conference and compete in the NCAA Division&nbsp;I in all sports. The football team regularly makes bowl game appearances, and the men's basketball team has made 19 appearances in the NCAA Division&nbsp;I Tournament—including five Final Four appearances. The men's golf team has won 16 national championships—the  of any NCAA golf program.  The University of Houston began as Houston Junior College (HJC). On March 7, 1927, trustees of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution that authorized the founding and operating of a junior college. The junior college was operated and administered by HISD. Originally HJC was located in San Jacinto High School and offered only night courses. Its first session began March 7, 1927, with an enrollment of 232 students and 12 faculty. This session was primarily held to educate the future teachers of the junior college, freshmen were not permitted to enroll. A more accurate date for the official opening of HJC is September 19, 1927, when enrollment was opened to all persons having completed the necessary educational requirements. The first president of HJC was Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer, who was the dominant force in establishing the junior college.  The junior college became eligible to become a university in October 1933 when Governor of Texas, Miriam A. Ferguson, signed House Bill 194 into law. On April 30, 1934, HISD's Board of Education adopted a resolution to make the school a four-year institution, and Houston Junior College changed its name to the University of Houston. UH's first session as a four-year institution began June 4, 1934, at San Jacinto High School with an enrollment of 682. In 1934, the first campus of the University of Houston was established at the Second Baptist Church at Milam and McGowen. The next fall, the campus was moved to the South Main Baptist Church on Main Street—between Richmond Avenue and Eagle Street—where it stayed for the next five years. In May 1935, the institution as a university held its first commencement at Miller Outdoor Theatre.  In 1936, heirs of philanthropists J. J. Settegast and Ben Taub donated  to the university for use as a permanent location. At this time, there was no road that led to the land tract, but in 1937, the city added Saint Bernard Street, which was later renamed to Cullen&nbsp;Boulevard. It would become a major thoroughfare of the campus. As a project of the National Youth Administration, workers were paid fifty cents an hour to clear the land. In 1938, Hugh Roy Cullen donated $335,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) for the first building to be built at the location. The Roy Gustav Cullen Memorial Building was dedicated on June 4, 1939, and classes began the next day. The first full semester of classes began officially on Wednesday, September 20, 1939. In a year after opening the new campus, the university had about 2,500 students.  As World War II approached, enrollment decreased due to the draft and enlistments. The university proposed to be in a new, highly unusual training activity of the United States Navy, and was one of six institutions selected to give the Primary School in the Electronics Training Program.Test and Research Staff, Bureau of Naval Personnel; "Psychological test construction and research in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. Part V. Navy radio technician training program"; American Psychologist, vol 1(3), Mar. 1946, pp 80-90  By the fall of 1943, there were only about 1,100 regular students at UH; thus, the 300 or so servicemen contributed in sustaining the faculty and facilities of the Engineering College. This training at UH continued until March 1945, with a total of 4,178 students.Watson, Raymond C., Jr.; Solving the Naval Radar Crisis, Trafford Publishing, 2007, pp. 207-208, ISBN 978-1-4251-6173-6 On March 12, 1945, Senate Bill 207 was signed into law, removing the control of the University of Houston from HISD and placing it into the hands of a board of regents. In 1945, the university—which had grown too large and complex for the Houston school board to administer—became a private university.   In March 1947, the regents authorized creation of a law school at the university. In 1949, the M.D. Anderson Foundation made a $1.5&nbsp;million gift to UH for the construction of a dedicated library building on the campus. By 1950, the educational plant at UH consisted of 12 permanent buildings. Enrollment was more than 14,000 with a full-time faculty of more than 300. KUHF, the university radio station, signed on in November. By 1951, UH was the second-largest university in the State of Texas and was the fastest growing university in the United States.  In 1953, the university established KUHT—the first educational television station in the nation—after the four-year-long Federal Communications Commission's television licensing freeze ended. During this period, however, the university as a private institution was facing financial troubles. Tuition failed to cover rising costs, and in turn, tuition increases caused a drop in enrollment. After a lengthy battle between supporters of the University of Houston, led by school president A.D. Bruce, and forces from state universities geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963. As the University of Houston celebrated its 50th anniversary, the Texas Legislature formally established the University of Houston&nbsp;System in 1977. Philip G. Hoffman resigned from his position as president of UH and became the first chancellor of the University of Houston&nbsp;System. The University of Houston became the oldest and largest member institution in the UH&nbsp;System with nearly 30,000 students. On April 26, 1983, the university appended its official name to University of Houston–University Park; however, the name was changed back to University of Houston on August 26, 1991. This name change was an effort by the UH&nbsp;System to give its flagship institution a distinctive name that would eliminate confusion with the University of  (UHD), which is a separate and distinct degree-granting institution that is not part of the University of Houston.  In 1997, the administrations of the UH System and the University of Houston were combined under a single chief executive officer, with the dual title of Chancellor of the UH&nbsp;System and President of the University of Houston. Arthur K. Smith became the first person to have held the combined position. As of 1997, the University of Houston System Administration has been located on campus in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. On October 15, 2007, Renu Khator was selected for the position of UH System chancellor and UH president. On November 5, 2007, Khator was confirmed as the third person to hold the dual title of UH System chancellor and UH president concurrently, and took office in January 2008. In January 2011, the University of Houston was classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a research university with very high research activity. The university designation makes UH one of only three public universities in Texas with that classification.  The university commemorated this milestone on January 28, 2011 with a "Celebration of Excellence" event on campus in recognition of the so-called "" research designation.   The campus of the University of Houston is located in southeast Houston, with an official address of 4800&nbsp;Calhoun Road.  It was known as University of  from 1983 to 1991. The campus spans  and is roughly bisected by Cullen&nbsp;Boulevard—a thoroughfare that has become synonymous with the university. The university campus includes numerous green spaces, fountains, and sculptures, including a work by famed sculptor Jim Sanborn. Renowned architects César Pelli and Philip Johnson have designed buildings on the UH campus. Recent campus beautification projects have garnered awards from the Keep Houston Beautiful group for improvements made to the Cullen&nbsp;Boulevard corridor. The University of Houston (UH) is not a multi-campus university; it does not have a "main campus" or any branch campus.  The University of  (UHCL), the University of  (UHD), and the University of  (UHV) are separate universities; they are not branch campuses of UH.

The University of Houston (UH) is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the University of Houston&nbsp;System, and was known as University of  from 1983 to 1991. UH is not a multi-campus university; it does not have a "main campus" or any branch campus.  The University of  (UHCL), the University of  (UHD), and the University of  (UHV) are  universities; they are not branch campuses of UH. The organization and control of the University of Houston is vested in the Board of Regents of the University of Houston&nbsp;System. The Board has all the rights, powers, and duties that it has with respect to the organization and control of other institutions in the System; however, UH is maintained as a separate and distinct institution.    The president is the chief executive officer (CEO) of the University of Houston, and serves concurrently as chancellor of the University of Houston&nbsp;System. The chancellor is the CEO of the UH&nbsp;System, and the position is appointed by its board of regents. The administrations of the University of Houston and the UH&nbsp;System are located on the university campus in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. The Chancellor/President resides in the Wortham&nbsp;House, provided by the Board of Regents of the University of Houston&nbsp;System as part of the chancellor/president's employment contract.   The mission of the University of Houston is to "discover and disseminate knowledge through the education of a diverse population of traditional and nontraditional students, and through research, artistic and scholarly endeavors, as it becomes the nation's premier public university in an urban setting."

Moody Towers, frequently just called "The Towers," is one of the tallest complexes on campus and the largest area of residence halls. Each of the two towers consists of eighteen stories and together house 1,100 students. The Towers feature a newly renovated dining hall. The rooms in The Towers are scheduled to be renovated during the summer of 2011. The Quadrangle, also known as "The Quad," is the oldest housing area on campus and consists of several coed dorm halls: Bates, Law, Oberholtzer, Settegast, and Taub. Oberholtzer Hall features a smaller, albeit cozy dining hall. The Quadrangle houses 800 students. The rooms in The Quads are scheduled to be renovated during the summer of 2011.   In August 2009, Calhoun Lofts—a new university-owned and operated residential facility aimed at graduate and professional students—opened and includes retail stores, lecture halls, and recreation facilities. Cougar Village I & II are new freshman/Honors College dorm which opened in August 2010 and August 2013, respectively. The dormitory features themed floors with kitchens and lounges, a tutoring center, computer labs, multi-purpose rooms, study areas, a convenience store, a laundry facility, and a fitness center. Cougar&nbsp;Village&nbsp;I&nbsp;&&nbsp;II are exclusive only to freshman and Honor College students. In addition to traditional dormitories, Cougar Place was an apartment-style housing complex consisting of 400 units. Cougar&nbsp;Place has since been demolished as of 2013 and has been replaced with a new on-campus housing complex for sophomores. The university has privately owned apartment complexes on campus: Cullen Oaks, Bayou Oaks, and Cambridge Oaks.  The official student newspaper is The Daily Cougar, and has been published since 1927. Students also produce the official University of Houston yearbook, The Houstonian. The UH Student Video Network, a student-run network, appears on the University of Houston cable network and is one of the few fee-funded student organizations on campus. COOG Radio, the University of Houston's student-run college radio station, made its debut on August 29, 2011.   The seal of the University of Houston, officially adopted in 1938, is a stylized version of the coat-of-arms of General Sam Houston. The first official version was placed on the floor of the Roy Gustav Cullen Building. The official colors of the University of Houston are scarlet red and albino white. These were the colors of Sam Houston's ancestor, Sir Hugh, and were adopted by UH at the same time as the official seal. Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the goodness and purity of spirit embodied in helping one's fellow man. Cougar Red Friday is part of the ongoing Keep Houston Red initiative at the University of Houston.  Students and staff are encouraged to wear red shirts on Friday to show pride and passion for the University."Cougar Red Friday"  The school's official mascot is a cougar, which was adopted in 1947 and later named Shasta.Our History & Traditions - University of Houston The university owned a series of female cougars, but this tradition ceased in 1989, upon the death of Shasta V. When a cougar cub was orphaned in Washington State and moved to the Houston Zoo in 2011, the university adopted it as its first live male cougar mascot. The Frontiersmen - initially exclusive to members of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, but later opened membership to the entire student body - is a group of students who participate in university events to drive school spirit. At football games, the Frontiersmen—donning cowboy hats, Wrangler Jeans, and dusters for attire—run across the field with the university's flag and the Flag of Texas after each score. Frontier Fiesta—a re-creation of a 19th-century Western town, with music, food and historical exhibits—is a major event on campus each spring semester. The student-led festival is a part of a long-standing tradition dating back to the 1940s established by Gan Bey which later became the Sigma Chi Fraternity's Epsilon Xi chapter at UH. Frontier Fiesta attained widespread notoriety when the Sigma Chi variety show performance known as "Bella Union" garnered national attention on the cover of Life (magazine) as "The Greatest College Show on Earth" and soon-after drew crowds numbered in the tens of thousands from all across the country to participate in the festivities. As Frontier Fiesta grew it eventually evolved into what we know today as the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Although, there is still an annual "Frontier Fiesta" held on UH's campus - the Houston Rodeo is today's closest resemblance to the original Frontier Fiesta. The BLAZE is an oil field warning siren that was chosen to represent the university's ties to the petroleum industry. The purchase of the siren was completed in 1991. The Sigma Chi Fraternity has been in charge of the siren and gave it the name "The BLAZE" in honor of its fallen brother, David Blazek. Cougar First Impressions—a program headed by the UH Staff Council—takes place every year on the first two days of classes, when faculty and staff turn out to welcome new and returning students.    The Cougar Paw is a popular hand sign used by University of Houston students, faculty, alumni, and athletics fans to represent camaraderie and support. The Cougar Paw tradition was adopted through several athletics events between the University of Houston and the University of Texas. The University of Houston and the University of Texas played their first football game against one another in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge of taking care of Shasta&nbsp;I, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts. The Cougars didn't play the Longhorns again until 1968. With UH fans holding up the new sign of Cougar pride, UH played UT to a 20–20 tie. They didn't meet again until 1976, the first year UH was a member of the Southwest Conference. In front of a record crowd at Texas' Memorial Stadium, UH defeated UT 30–0, a rout that signaled the beginning of the end for legendary Texas coach Darrell Royal. This solidified the use of the Cougar Paw as a tradition.    UH's 17-sport intercollegiate program is a member of the American Athletic Conference. Houston was previously a member of Conference USA, of which it was a member since the conference was formed in 1995 to 2013. During that timespan, the Cougars won 33 C-USA titles.  Prior to 1995, Houston was a member of the Southwest Conference. After 61 years of athletics at UH, other notable achievements include 16 national titles in men's golf, five NCAA Men's Basketball Final&nbsp;Four appearances, and two College World Series appearances. More than 50 Olympic athletes have attended UH, bringing home 33 medals, including 19 gold. Former Olympian and UH alumnus Leroy Burrell returned as the men's track and field head coach in 1998. In April 2014, Kelvin Sampson was named the eighth men's basketball head coach. Ronald Hughey is the current women's basketball coach. In December 2014, Tom Herman was introduced as the head football coach. In addition to varsity sports, the University of Houston offers a variety of intramural sports programs.   The university has an intercollegiate sports program that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).
