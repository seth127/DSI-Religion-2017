   The 3rd Infantry Division (nicknamed the "Marne Division") is an infantry division of the United States Army based at Fort Stewart, Georgia. It is a direct subordinate unit of the XVIII Airborne Corps and U.S. Army Forces Command. Its current organization includes three brigade combat teams, one aviation brigade, a division artillery and support elements. The division has a distinguished history, having seen active service in both World War I and World War II. The division fought in France in World War I. In World War II, it landed with Gen. Patton's task force in a contested amphibious landing on the coast of Morocco, North Africa, overwhelming Vichy French defenders in November 1942. In 1943, the division invaded Sicily in July, and invaded Italy at Salerno in September, before fighting in France and finally Germany. Medal of Honor recipient Audie Murphy, featured in the Hollywood movie, "To Hell and Back," was a member. The division also served in the Korean War. From 1957 until 1996, the division was a major part of the United States Army's presence in the NATO alliance in West Germany. The 3rd Division was activated in November 1917 during World War I at Camp Greene, North Carolina. Eight months later, it saw combat for the first time in France. At midnight on 14 July 1918, the division earned lasting distinction. Engaged in the Aisne-Marne Offensive as a member of the American Expeditionary Forces to Europe, the division was protecting Paris with a position on the banks of the Marne River. The 7th Machine Gun Battalion of the 3rd Division rushed to Château-Thierry amid retreating French troops and held the Germans back at the Marne River. While surrounding units retreated, the 3rd Infantry Division, including the 30th and 38th Infantry Regiments, remained steadfast throughout the Second Battle of the Marne, thus earning its nickname as the "Rock of the Marne". The rest of the division was absorbed under French command until brought back together under the command of General Joseph T. Dickman and by 15 July 1918 they took the brunt of what was to be the last German offensive of the war. General "Black Jack" Pershing called this stand "one of the most brilliant pages in the annals of military history". During the war two members of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor. Casualties during the war were 3,177 killed in action with 12,940 wounded. The 3rd Division is one of the few American divisions that fought the Axis on all European fronts  during World War II, and was among the first American combat units to engage in offensive ground combat operations.Blue and White Devils: The Story of the 3rd Infantry Division It saw combat in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France, Germany and Austria for 531 consecutive days. The division first saw action as a part of the Western Task Force in the invasion of North Africa, landing at Fedala on 8 November 1942, and captured half of French Morocco. Eight months later, on 10 July 1943, the division made an assault landing on Sicily, Licata town on the beach, to west, called Torre di Gaffi and Mollarella and on the beach, to east, called Falconara. Fought its way into Palermo before the armor could get there, and raced on to capture Messina, thus ending the Sicilian campaign. Nine days after the invasion of mainland Italy, on 18 September 1943, the 3rd landed at Salerno. Seeing intensive action along the way, the division drove to and across the Volturno River by October 1943, and then to Cassino, where the Battle of Monte Cassino would later be fought. After a brief rest, the division was part of the amphibious landing at Anzio, 22 January 1944, as part of VI Corps, alongside the British 1st Division. It would remain there for four months in a toe-hold against furious German counterattacks. On 29 February 1944, the 3rd fought off an attack by three German divisions. In a single day of combat at Anzio, the 3rd Infantry Division suffered more than 900 casualties, the most of any American division on one day in World War II. The division's former commander, John P. Lucas, was replaced as head of VI Corps by the 3rd Division's then-commander Lucian Truscott. In late May, VI Corps broke out of the beachhead in Operation Diadem with the 3rd Division in the main thrust. Instead of defeating the Germans, Clark sent the division on to Rome. This allowed the enemy forces, which would otherwise have been trapped, to escape. The division was then removed from the front line and went into training for the Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France. On 15 August 1944, D-Day for Dragoon, the division landed at St. Tropez, advanced up the Rhone Valley, through the Vosges Mountains, and reached the Rhine at Strasbourg, 26–27 November 1944. After maintaining defensive positions it took part in clearing the Colmar Pocket on 23 January, and on 15 March struck against Siegfried Line positions south of Zweibrücken. The division advanced through the defenses and crossed the Rhine, 26 March 1945; then drove on to take Nuremberg in a fierce battle, capturing the city in block-by-block fighting, 17–20 April. The 3rd pushed on to take Augsburg and Munich, 27–30 April, and was in the vicinity of Salzburg when the war in Europe ended.Stanton, Shelby, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946 (Revised Edition, 2006), p. 80 Elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment serving under the 3rd Infantry Division captured Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden. During the war, 4,922 were killed in action, and 18,766 wounded with a further 636 who died of wounds. Commanders:  During the Korean War, the division was known as the "Fire Brigade" for its rapid response to crisis. 3rd Infantry Division had been headquartered at Fort Benning along with its 15th Infantry Regiment. The 7th Infantry Regiment was located at Fort Devens. 3rd Infantry Division initially arrived in Japan where, as the Far East Command Reserve,Rottman, Gordon L., Korean War order of battle, Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated, December 2002 ISBN 978-0-275-97835-8 it planned post conflict occupation missions in northern Korea.Cowart, Glenn C. (1992). Miracle In Korea: The Evacuation of X Corps from the Hungnam Beachhead. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press. ISBN 0-87249-829-8. In Japan their strength was increased by augmentation from South Korean soldiers. They landed at Wonsan and received the 65th Infantry Regiment as their third maneuver element before moving north to Hungnam and Majon-dong. At Majon-dong they established a defensive position with the 65th Infantry and began fighting. 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 7th Infantry were on the left flank. The 15th Infantry was between the 7th and 65th Regiments. 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry was set as the nucleus for Task Force Dog which was commanded by Brigadier General Armistead D. Mead, assistant 3rd Division commander and sent north to conduct a relief in place with 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment at Chinhung-ni; the south end of the 1st Marine Division and support the withdrawal of 1st Marine Division and Regimental Combat Team 31 from the Chosin Reservoir. 3rd Infantry Division's TF Dog was the rearguard keeping the pressure off of the Marine column. The division established, along with the 7th Infantry Division a collapsing perimeter around the port of Hungnam until the last of X Corps was off the beach. The port of Hungnam was blown up to deprive the enemy the use of those facilities as the last of the 7th, 15th, and 65th Infantry units boarded ships. The division went on to support combat missions of the Eighth Army until 1953 when it was withdrawn. Notably, the division fought valiantly, besides its extremely essential and able contribution during the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, at the Chorwon-Kumwha area, Jackson Heights and Arrowhead outposts, and blocked a CCF push in the Kumsong Area in July 1953. 3rd Infantry Division received ten Battle Stars. Eleven more members of the unit received Medals of Honor during the Korean War. Eight were from the 7th Infantry Regiment: Jerry K. Crump (6 and 7 September 1951), John Essebagger, Jr. (25 April 1951), Charles L. Gilliland (25 April 1951), Clair Goodblood (24 and 25 April 1951), Noah O. Knight (23 and 24 November 1951), Darwin K. Kyle (16 February 1951), Leroy A. Mendonca (4 July 1951), and Hiroshi H. Miyamura, whose award was classified Top Secret until his repatriation (24 and 25 April 1951). Three more recipients were with the 15th Infantry Regiment: Emory L. Bennett (24 June 1951), Ola L. Mize (10 and 11 June 1953) and Charles F. Pendleton (16 and 17 July 1953). During the Korean War, the division had 2,160 killed in action and 7,939 wounded. Commanders:  The division was stationed with the V Corps (1958–63, 1992-1996) and VII Corps (1963–92) in West Germany from near the Czech border westward throughout various towns including Wūrzburg (Div. Hq. & Support Command), Schweinfurt (1st Brigade), Kitzingen (2nd Brigade), and Aschaffenburg (3rd Brigade). In August 1961, a few days after the Berlin Wall was erected, a reinforced company from the 7th Infantry Regiment (a unit of the 3rd Infantry Division) in full battle gear, was ordered to travel along the Autobahn (a major highway) from Aschaffenburg in Bavaria to West Berlin. This was to assert the right of US forces to travel unhindered from West Germany across the western part of East Germany to West Berlin. After the Berlin Wall was built, it was not known if the East German forces would attempt to impede or restrict the movement of US troops when crossing East Germany while trying to reach West Berlin. The unit arrived in West Berlin without incident confirming the right of free passage. In November 1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, more than 6,000 3rd Infantry Division men and women deployed with the 1st Armored Division on Operation Desert Storm as part of the Allied Coalition. They participated in the Battle of Medina Ridge which was the largest tank battle of the conflict. The 3rd Brigade was credited with the destruction of 82 tanks, 31 Armored Personnel Carriers, 11 artillery pieces, 48 trucks, 3 AAA guns and captured 72 EPW's with the loss of 2 Bradley Cavalry vehicles, 30 WIA's and 1 KIA. Later nearly 1,000 soldiers deployed to southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq to provide comfort to Kurdish refugees. In late Spring of 1991, the division supplied senior ranking officers and non-commissioned officers, along with a military police company to Task Force Victory (Forward). Stationed in Kuwait the Task Force was to provide division level support to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (which shared the same duty station). Those elements of V Corps attached to the task force (including those of division) returned to their home units in early September 1991. As part of the Army's reduction to a ten-division force, the 24th Infantry Division was inactivated on 15 February 1996, and reflagged to become the 3rd Infantry Division. In 1996 the division was redeployed to Fort Stewart, Fort Benning, and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia. The division repeatedly demonstrated its deployability since then by maintaining a battalion, and later a brigade task force presence in Kuwait. It has also moved sizable forces to Egypt, Bosnia and Kosovo in partnership training and peacekeeping missions. In 1996–97, the 3rd Infantry Division Detachment, Rear Tactical Operations Center (RTOC), which is a unit manned by the Georgia Army National Guard was mobilized and served in Operation Joint Endeavor. During this time, the 3rd ID RTOC served under the 1st Infantry Division and later the 1st Armored Division. Respectively serving in Bosnia, at Camps Dallas and Angela, near Tuzla under the 1ID, and then in Croatia at Slavonski Brod, under the 1AD, serving the Assistant Division Commander for Support, then BG George Casey. Early in 2003 the entire division deployed in weeks to Kuwait. It was called on subsequently to spearhead Coalition forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom, fighting its way to Baghdad in early April, leading to the end of the Saddam Hussein government. The First Brigade captured the Baghdad International Airport and cleared and secured the airport, which also resulted in the division's first Medal of Honor since the Korean War, awarded to SFC Paul Ray Smith. Second Brigade, Third Infantry division made the much-publicized "Thunder Run" into downtown Baghdad. The Second Brigade was redeployed to Fallujah, Iraq during the summer of 2003. The division returned to the United States in September 2003. Order of Battle during 2003 invasion: ::1st Brigade :::2nd BN, 7th Infantry Regiment (Mech) :::3rd BN, 7th Infantry Regiment (Mech) :::3rd BN, 69th Armor Regiment :::1st BN, 41st Field Artillery Regiment (155SP) ::2nd Brigade :::3rd SQN, 7th Cavalry Regiment (Mech) :::3rd BN, 15th Infantry Regiment (Mech) :::1st BN, 64th Armor Regiment :::4th BN, 64th Armor Regiment :::1st BN, 9th Field Artillery Regiment (155SP) ::3rd Brigade :::1st BN, 15th Infantry Regiment (Mech) :::1st BN, 30th Infantry Regiment (Mech) :::2nd BN, 69th Armor Regiment :::1st BN, 10th Field Artillery Regiment (155SP) Beginning in 2004, the 3rd began re-organizing. The division shifted from three maneuver brigades to four "units of action", which are essentially smaller brigade formations, with one infantry, one armor, one cavalry, and one artillery battalion in each. The former Engineer Brigade became the 4th Brigade at Fort Stewart. Each of these units of action engaged in several mock battles at the National Training Center (NTC) and Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), and preparation for a second deployment to Iraq. In January 2005, the Third Infantry Division became the first Army division to serve a second tour in Iraq. The division headquarters took control of the Multi-National Division Baghdad, MND-B, headquartered at Camp Liberty and with responsibility for the greater Baghdad area. First and Third Brigades of the Third Infantry Division were placed under control of the 42nd Infantry Division, and later under the 101st Airborne Division, in MND-North. In preparation of this deployment a Fourth Brigade was organized and became the first cohesive brigade combat team sent into a combat zone by the US Army, cohesive in that it fulfilled the table of organization requirement of such a unit. The California Army National Guard's 1st Battalion 184th Infantry Regiment served as one of the brigade's two infantry battalions, as well as the detachment from the Hawaii Army National Guard's 29th Brigade Combat Team, the 2/299th Infantry,also the 48th Brigade Combat Team from the Georgia Army National Guard and Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 295th Infantry Battalion from the Puerto Rico Army National Guard served in this Operation. 2/69 Armor was assigned to Camp War Horse in Iraq. By Mid 2005 Primary elements of 2/69 Armor 3rd Brigade 3rd Infantry Division was re-deployed to Ramadi Iraq, replacing elements of the 2nd ID. They ran joint missions with 2nd Mar Div. and elements of the Pennsylvania National Guard. The division redeployed to Fort Stewart and Fort Benning in January 2006. On 17 November 2006, the Army announced that the Third Infantry Division is scheduled to return to Iraq in 2007 and thus become the first Army division to serve three tours in Iraq. The division headquarters became the leadership organization of MND-C (Multi-National Division Central), a new command established south of Baghdad as part of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In support of operations in Baghdad, the unit 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry was detached from 3ID and assigned by General Petraeus to 3rd BCT, 82nd Airborne who was under the command of the 1st Cavalry Division. In 2008, 82nd Airborne and 1st CAV redeployed home, and 3–7 CAV was handed over to 3rd BCT, 4th Infantry Division under the command of the 25th Infantry Division. They would remain under this command until 3–7 CAV's redeployment back to Fort Stewart, being reattached to the 3rd Infantry Division. Similarly, 1st Battalion, 64th Armor was detached from 3ID and attached to 2nd BCT, 1st Infantry Division under 1st Cavalry Division, and later under 2nd BCT, 101st Infantry Division under command of 4th Infantry Division.  In the fall of 2008, the 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade was assigned to serve as the on-call federal response force under the control of NORTHCOM, the combatant command assigned responsibility for the continental United States. The brigade remained at its home station of Fort Stewart, Georgia, and "is training to deploy domestically in response to terrorist attacks or other national emergencies."Balko, Radley. Constitutional Refuseniks, Reason (May 2011)  The brigade will be trained in responding to WMD attacks, crowd control, and dealing with civil unrest. The force was renamed "Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive Consequence Management Response Force". Its acronym, CCMRF, is pronounced "see-smurf", and the unit is now under the daily control of United States Northern Command's Army North, whose mission is to "protect the United States homeland and support local, state, and federal authorities." The unit is a multi-branch force with servicemembers from the four branches of the United States Department of Defense. In March 2009, 4th Brigade reorganized from a mechanized or heavy brigade to a light infantry brigade. As part of this reorganization, 4th Battalion, 64th Armor was reflagged as 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment.  The 3rd Infantry Division assumed command of the Multi-National Division-North, now United States Division-North, in October 2009. This milestone marked the division’s fourth tour in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (I, III, V, and VII). The division has elements operating in every area of Iraq as the mission changes from Operation Iraqi Freedom to Operation New Dawn on 1 September 2010. With the advent of Operation New Dawn, the focus will shift from combat operations to stability and advise and assist operations throughout all Iraq’s provinces. In the course of Operation Iraqi Freedom up until 24 September 2010, 436 members of the division were killed in action  The Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division deployed to Afghanistan for a 13-month tour. The brigade was the first unit from 3ID to deploy to Afghanistan. During that tour 3rd CAB soldiers flew about 26,000 missions, including 800 air assaults, and were responsible for about 2,500 enemy casualties. No soldiers from the brigade were killed during the tour.  3rd CAB is slated to deploy to Afghanistan again in January 2013. The 2500 soldiers will deploy with 3rd Special Troops Battalion for a 9-month tour. The Marne Air will be operating out of Kandahar Airfield in the RC-South area-of-operations, relieving the 25th CAB. Both the 3rd CAB and 3rd STB will fall under their parent division when the 3ID Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion deploys in August and takes over command of RC-South from 82nd Airborne Division HQ. The 2nd Heavy BCT's two combined-arms battalions also deployed individually to Afghanistan. 1st Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment deployed in March 2012. They are attached to the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (United States) from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA, to help train Afghanistan National Security Forces to take over in their country’s security operations. 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment deployed a month earlier. They are tasked with providing security to units conducting contingency operations. Both battalions will serve nine-month tour. In December 2012, the 3rd Sustainment Brigade deployed for its fifth deployment over the last decade and first to Afghanistan, for nine months in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 12-13, let by COL Ron Novack and CSM Daniels. Deployed to Kandahar with 276 soldiers the brigade provided sustainment and retrograde support to the 3rd and 4th Infantry Divisions, 1st and 2nd Marine Expeditionary Forces, and International Security Assistance Forces operating in Regional Commands South, Southwest, and National Support Element-West. The brigade assisted in the closure and transfer of over 61 Forward Operating Bases while simultaneously providing sustainment to the force. Additionally, the 3rd Sustainment Brigade provided direct support to the 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Teams and the Combat Aviation Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division. In February 2013, the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division (later reflagged as the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division), deployed to Logar Province and Wardak Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  6th Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment was tasked with securing Logar Province, and disrupting the almost daily rocket attacks on Forward Operation Base Shank. 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment was tasked with securing Wardak Province's highly volatile Highway 1.  The Soldier's of 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division returned home in late November 2013 after serving a 9-month tour.   3rd Infantry Division: All BCTs are headquartered at Fort Stewart except for 3rd BCT, which is located at Fort Benning. The 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team deactivated on January 15, 2015 due to budget controls. 2-3 Special Troops Battalion; 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment; 1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment; and 26th Brigade Support Battalion were deactivated concurrently with some of their companies joining other brigades' battalions. The maneuver battalions of 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team moved to other brigades in the division: 1st Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment moved to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team and 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment moved to 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. With the deactivation of 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team was reflagged as the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The 42nd Fires Brigade was activated at Fort Stewart on October 17, 2013 and later reflagged as 3rd Infantry Division Artillery. It is uncertain at this stage what units will join the 3rd Infantry Division Artillery, which in the meantime has training oversight of the combat brigades' artillery battalions. 4th IBCT will reflag to 2 IBCT on Monday May 18 10 AM along with 1-76 FA deactivating and reflagging as 1-9 FA. 4th IBCT Special Troops Battalion will reflag as 9th Brigade Engineer Battalion and 11th Brigade Engineer Battalion, originally 1st BCT Special Troops Battalion, will become the Brigade Engineer Battalion for the 3d IBCT. Although the Army announced they that will have to inactivate the 3rd Brigade Combat Team by the end of 2015 and replace it with a Battalion Task Force centered around the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry. The Last of the 3rd Brigade  Combat Team  unit has Inactivated December 18, 2015. all the units of 3rd Brigade are officially gone. 3d Infantry Division Lineage and Honors Division Artillery Lineage and Honors US Army, Center of Military History, Lineage and Honors Constituted 16 March 1985 in the Regular Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, and activated in Germany.Aviation Brigade Lineage and Honors Deployed to Afghanistan in November 2009 and returned home in November 2010. 3d ID MoH recipients Dogface Soldier http://www.stewart.army.mil/info/?id=464&p=2 Ribbon Award Year Notes Presidential Unit Citation (Army) 1945 Streamer embroidered COLMAR Presidential Unit Citation (Army) 2003 Streamer embroidered IRAQ 2003 Meritorious Unit Commendation 2007–2008 Streamer embroidered IRAQ 2007-2008 Meritorious Unit Commendation 2009–2010 Streamer not yet approved (Permanent Order 005-06 dated 5 January 2011 - pending DAGO) French Croix de guerre with Palm 1945 Streamer embroidered COLMAR French Fourragère in the colors of the Croix de guerre 1945 Fourragère Presidential Unit Citation (Korea) 1951 Streamer embroidered UIJONGBU CORRIDOR Presidential Unit Citation (Korea) 1953 Streamer embroidered IRON TRIANGLE Chryssoun Aristion Andrias(Bravery Gold Medal of Greece) 1950–1953 Streamer embroidered KOREA Ribbon Award Year Notes Presidential Unit Citation (Army) 1945 Streamer embroidered COLMAR Meritorious Unit Commendation 2007–2008 Streamer embroidered IRAQ 2007-2008 French Croix de guerre with Palm 1945 Streamer embroidered COLMAR French Fourragère in the colors of the Croix de guerre 1945 Fourragère Presidential Unit Citation (Korea) 1951 Streamer embroidered UIJONGBU CORRIDOR Presidential Unit Citation (Korea) 1953 Streamer embroidered IRON TRIANGLE Chryssoun Aristion Andrias(Bravery Gold Medal of Greece) 1950–1953 Streamer embroidered KOREA Ribbon Award Year Notes Presidential Unit Citation (Army) 1945 Streamer embroidered COLMAR Presidential Unit Citation (Army) 2003 Streamer embroidered IRAQ 2003 Meritorious Unit Commendation 1951–1952 Streamer embroidered KOREA 1951–1952 French Croix de guerre with Palm 1945 Streamer embroidered COLMAR French Fourragère in the colors of the Croix de guerre 1945 Fourragère Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation 1951 Streamer embroidered UIJONGBU CORRIDOR Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation 1953 Streamer embroidered IRON TRIANGLE Chryssoun Aristion Andrias(Bravery Gold Medal of Greece) 1950–1953 Streamer embroidered KOREA Name Rank Division War/Conflict Honors/Notes Paul R.
