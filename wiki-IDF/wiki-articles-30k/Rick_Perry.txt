      James Richard "Rick" Perry (born March 4, 1950) is an American politician who served as the 47th Governor of Texas from December 2000 to January 2015. A Republican, he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1998 and assumed the governorship in December 2000 when then-governor George W. Bush resigned to become President of the United States. Perry was the longest-serving governor in Texas state history. Perry was elected to full gubernatorial terms in 2002, 2006 and 2010 and is the fourth Texas governor (after Allan Shivers, Price Daniel and John Connally) to serve three terms.  With a tenure in office of 14 years, 30 days, Perry was, at the time he left office, the second longest-serving current U.S. governor (after Terry Branstad of Iowa). Perry served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2008 and again in 2011. In July 2013, Perry announced that he was retiring as governor and would not seek re-election in 2014. On August 15, 2014, Perry was indicted on two felony charges related to his actions as governor. The charge against Perry of "coercion of a public servant" was dismissed in July 2015 when an appellate court ruled the statute unconstitutional. As of November 2015, Perry still faces one charge of "abuse of official capacity" in relation to his veto of funding for a state district attorney's office.Svitek, Patrick. "Indictment Cuts Both Ways as Perry Launches Bid", The Texas Tribune (June 3, 2015).Morris, Angela. "Perry Pays Defense Lawyers Another $1.2 million", Texas Lawyer (July 16, 2015). On June 4, 2015, Perry launched his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but after poor performance in polling after the first debate, he suspended his campaign, withdrawing on September 11, 2015, the first in the field to exit. A fifth-generation Texan, Perry grew up in Haskell County in West Texas, to cotton farmers Joseph Ray Perry and the former Amelia June Holt.  Perry's ancestry is almost entirely English, dating as far back as the original Thirteen Colonies.  His family has been in Texas since before the Texas Revolution. His father, a Democrat, was a long-time Haskell County commissioner and school board member. Perry has said that his interest in politics probably began in November 1961, when his father took him to the funeral of U.S. Representative Sam Rayburn (D-TX), who during his long public career served as speaker of the Texas House of Representatives for a short time at the age of 29 and then later for 17 years as the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Perry was in the Boy Scouts (BSA) and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. The BSA has honored Perry with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.  Perry graduated from Paint Creek High School in 1968. Upon graduation of high school, Perry attended Texas A&M University where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets, a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, was elected senior class social secretary, and was also elected as one of A&M's five yell leaders.From Cheerleading to Politics – ABC News. Abcnews.go.com (May 19, 2012). Retrieved on 2013-08-12. Perry graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science in animal science. Perry said that the Corps of Cadets gave him the discipline to complete his animal sciences degree and earn a commission in the Air Force. In a 1989 interview he said that "I was probably a bit of a free spirit, not particularly structured real well for life outside of a military regime, I would have not lasted at Texas Tech or the University of Texas. I would have hit the fraternity scene and lasted about one semester." Ultimately, Perry was elected a yell leader—a student that leads Aggie fans in a series of "yells" during athletic events or other school events—and social secretary for his class. In the early 1970s, Perry interned during several summers with the Southwestern Company, as a door-to-door book salesman. "I count my time working for Dortch Oldham [president of the Southwestern Company] as one of the most important formative experiences of my life," Perry said in 2010. "There is nothing that tests your commitment to a goal like getting a few doors closed in your face." He said that "Mr. Oldham taught legions of young people to communicate quickly, clearly and with passion, a lesson that has served me well in my life since then." Upon graduation from college in 1972, Perry was commissioned as an officer in the United States Air Force and completed pilot training in February 1974. He was then assigned as a C-130 pilot to the 772nd Tactical Airlift Squadron at Dyess Air Force Base. Perry's duties included two-month overseas rotations at RAF Mildenhall in England and Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany. His missions included a 1974 U.S. State Department drought relief effort in Mali, Mauritania and Chad, and two years later, earthquake relief in Guatemala. He left the United States Air Force in 1977 with the rank of Captain, returned to Texas, and went into business farming cotton with his father. In 1984, Perry was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat from district 64, which included his home county of Haskell. He served on the House Appropriations and Calendars committees during his three two-year terms in office. He befriended fellow freshman state representative Lena Guerrero of Austin, a staunch liberal Democrat who endorsed Perry's reelection bid in 2006. Perry was part of the "Pit Bulls", a group of Appropriations members who sat on the lower dais in the committee room (or "pit") who pushed for austere state budgets during the 1980s. At one point, The Dallas Morning News named him one of the ten most effective members of the legislature. In 1987, Perry voted for a $5.7 billion tax increase proposed by Republican governor Bill Clements.Jay Root, Rick Perry: The Democrat Years The Texas Tribune July 14, 2011. Perry supported Al Gore in the 1988 Democratic presidential primaries and worked in an unspecified capacity for Gore's campaign in Texas. On September 29, 1989, Perry announced that he was switching parties, becoming a Republican."50 Things You need to Know about Governor Rick Perry" Dallas Morning News February 19, 2010. In 1990, as a newly minted Republican, Perry challenged Jim Hightower, the incumbent Democratic Agriculture Commissioner. Karl Rove was Perry’s campaign manager. In the Republican primary on March 13, 1990, Perry polled 276,558 votes (47%), with Richard McIver garnering 176,976 votes (30%) and Gene L. Duke, who placed third, polling 132,497 votes (23%). Since Perry fell shy of the necessary 50% to win outright, a runoff was held between Perry and McIver set on April 10, 1990. In the runoff, he emerged victorious, garnering 96,649 votes (69%) to McIver's 43,921 votes (31%). During 1990, Hightower's office was embroiled in an FBI investigation into corruption and bribery. Three aides were convicted in 1993 of using public funds for political fundraising, although Hightower himself was not found to be involved in the wrongdoings.Three ex-aides to Hightower are sentenced Houston Chronicle. November 11, 1993 Perry narrowly defeated Hightower in November 1990, garnering 1,864,463 votes (49%) to Hightower's 1,820,145 votes (48%). According to the book Boy Genius: Karl Rove, the Brains Behind the Remarkable Political Triumph of George W. Bush, Rove raised $3 million to raise Perry’s profile, "while tarnishing the name of Jim Hightower" resulting in Perry’s name becoming a "household name in Texas—and Hightower’s name synonymous with corruption." As Agriculture Commissioner, Perry was responsible for promoting the sale of Texas farm produce to other states and foreign nations, and for supervising the calibration of weights and measures, such as gasoline pumps and grocery store scales. In April 1993, Perry, while serving as Texas agriculture commissioner, expressed support for the effort to reform the nation's health care, describing it as "most commendable". The health care plan, first revealed in September, was ultimately unsuccessful due to Republican congressional opposition.Mark, David. Going dirty: the Art of Negative Campaigning. p. 127. In 2005, after being questioned on the issue by a potential opponent in the Republican governor primary, Perry said that he expressed his support only in order to get Clinton to pay more attention to rural health care. In 1994, Perry was reelected Agriculture Commissioner by a large margin, getting 2,546,287 votes (62 percent) to Democrat Marvin Gregory's 1,479,692 (36 percent). Libertarian Clyde L. Garland received the remaining 85,836 votes (2 percent). Gregory, a chicken farmer from Sulphur Springs, Texas, was on the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority with Perry in the early nineties as a Republican, but became a Democrat before running against Perry in 1994. In 1998, Perry chose not to seek a third term as Agriculture Commissioner, running instead for Lieutenant Governor to succeed the retiring Democrat Bob Bullock. During this election, Rick Perry had a notable falling out with his previous top political strategist Karl Rove, which began the much-reported rivalry between the Bush and Perry camps. Perry polled 1,858,837 votes (50.04 percent) to the 1,790,106 (48.19 percent) cast for Democrat John Sharp of Victoria, who had relinquished the Comptroller's position after two terms to seek the lieutenant governorship. Libertarian Anthony Garcia polled another 65,150 votes (1.75 percent). Perry thus became the state's first Republican lieutenant governor since Reconstruction, taking office on January 19, 1999.   Perry assumed the office of governor on December 21, 2000, following the resignation of George W. Bush—who was preparing to become President of the United States. He won the office in his own right in the 2002 gubernatorial election, where he received 58% of votes to Laredo oilman and businessman Tony Sanchez's 40%. He was re-elected in the 2006 gubernatorial election against three major opponents, polling 39% of votes against runner-up former U.S. Congressman Chris Bell of Houston with 30%. In the 2010 gubernatorial election, Perry became the first Texas governor to be elected to three four-year terms, polling 55% of votes to former Houston Mayor Bill White's 42%. In his three gubernatorial campaigns, Perry received hard-money campaign contributions of $102 million, half of which came from 204 donors. In the 2001 legislative session, Perry set a record for his use of the veto, rejecting 82 acts, more than any other governor in any single legislative session in the history of the state since Reconstruction."The Executive Branch: Budgetary Powers", Texas Politics, University of Texas at Austin, retrieved June 20, 2011The Limits of the Veto, Texas Politics, University of Texas at Austin, retrieved June 20, 2011 In 2003, Perry formed the non-profit organization, the OneStar Foundation, designed to connects such the non-profits with resources and expertise to accomplish their missions and to promote volunteerism. He tapped the state Republican chairman Susan Weddington, who stepped down from that position after six years, as the president of OneStar. She left in 2009, and he chose Elizabeth Seale as her successor.  In his presidential campaign, Perry highlighted the economic success Texas achieved under his governorship, although the true success of his policies has been questioned.The Texas Unmiracle By PAUL KRUGMAN, New York Times, August 14, 2011 A proclaimed proponent of fiscal conservatism, Perry has often campaigned on job growth and tax issues, such as his opposition to creating a state income tax. Perry refused in 2002 to promise not to raise taxes as governor, and in the following years did propose or approve various tax and debt increases.Gleckman, Howard (August 16, 2011). "Rick Perry's Changing Take On Raising Taxes". Forbes."The Texas pole tax". The Economist. January 3, 2008."New Texas Margin Tax – Business or Income Tax". accountingweb.com. August 16, 2006. Retrieved August 18, 2011. In 2009, Perry signed Grover Norquist's pledge to "oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes". Texas began borrowing money in 2003 to pay for roads and will owe $17.3 billion by the end of 2012, increasing total state debt, from $13.4 billion in 2001 to $37.8 billion in 2011. The state's public finance authority sold $2 billion in bonds for unemployment benefits, and it's authorized to sell $1.5 billion more if necessary. Texas federal borrowing topped $1.6 billion in October 2010, before the bond sales. Texans voted November 8, 2011, for a Water Works Bill with an additional $6 billion of debt and against new tax breaks for landowners.Galbraith, Kate (November 9, 2011). "Texas Water Propositions Meet Different Fates". Texas Tribune. A Republican on the Natural Resources Committee laments "we couldn’t get the votes" which would break Perry's pledge not to raise taxes. In 2003, Perry signed legislation that created the Texas Enterprise Fund, which has since given $435 million in grants to businesses. The New York Times reported that many of the companies receiving grants, or their chief executives, have made contributions to Perry's campaigns or to the Republican Governors Association.Perry Mines Texas System to Raise Cash, by Nicholas Confessore and Michael Lu, New York Times, August 20, 2011. Perry has been criticized for supporting corporate tax breaks and other incentives, while the state government was experiencing budget deficits."Lines Blur as Texas Gives Industries a Bonanza." As Governor of Texas, Perry received grades of B in 2004, B in 2006, B in 2008, B in 2010, C in 2012, and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors. As governor, Perry has been an outspoken opponent of federal health-care reform proposals and of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, describing the latter as "socialism on American soil". Perry's focus in Texas has been on tort reform, signing a bill in 2003 which restricted non-economic damages in medical malpractice judgments. Perry touted this approach in his Presidential campaign, although independent analysts have concluded that it has failed to increase the supply of physicians or limit health-care costs in Texas. During Perry's governorship, Texas rose from second to first among states with the highest proportion of uninsured residents at 26%, and had the lowest level of access to prenatal care in the U.S. Perry and the state legislature have cut Medicaid spending. The Los Angeles Times wrote that under Perry, "working Texans increasingly have been priced out of private healthcare while the state's safety net has withered." Perry's office said that Texas represents a model private-sector approach to health-care. His spokeswoman stated that "Texas does provide an adequate safety net to those truly in need... and many individuals simply choose not to purchase healthcare coverage." Perry is pro-life and has signed bills with rules or restrictions for abortion procedures and funding for them.  In December 2011, Perry said he had undergone a "transformation" and now opposed all abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. The next day he clarified that he would allow an exception for abortions that would save a mother's life.Saenz, Arlette. "Rick Perry Clarifies Abortion Stand, Mother’s Life Only Exception." ABC News, December 28, 2011.Philpott, Ben. "Rick Perry Pivots on Abortion." KUT News, December 27, 2011. In February 2007, Perry issued an executive order mandating that Texas girls receive the HPV vaccine, which protects against some strains of the human papilloma virus, a contributing factor to some forms of cervical cancer.Carney, Timothy (June 21, 2011) "Rick Perry's mixed record on regulatory robbery", The Washington Examiner Following the move, news outlets reported various apparent financial connections between Perry and the vaccine's manufacturer, Merck. Merck's political action committee has contributed $28,500 since 2001 to Perry's campaigns.Mason, Melanie. "Rick Perry understated drug company campaign cash." Los Angeles Times, September 13, 2011. The order was criticized by some parents and social conservatives, and a lawsuit was filed later that month. In May 2007, the Texas Legislature passed a bill undoing the order; Perry did not veto the bill, saying the veto would have been overruled, but blamed lawmakers who supported the bill for the deaths of future cancer victims. In 2011, Perry both had adult stem cell surgery in Houston and started "laying the groundwork" for the commercialization of the adult stem cell industry in Texas. Perry grew up in the United Methodist Church.  He and his family were members of Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin until 2010, when they began attending Lake Hills Church, a non-denominational evangelical megachurch in western Travis County. Perry told the Austin American-Statesman that he began attending Lake Hills because it was close to the rental home where he and his wife lived while the Governor's Mansion was being renovated. In 2006, Perry stated that he believes in the inerrancy of the Bible and that those who do not accept Jesus as their Savior will go to hell. A couple of days later, he clarified, "I don't know that there's any human being that has the ability to interpret what God and his final decision-making is going to be." In his 2008 book On My Honor, Perry expressed his views on the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution. "Let's be clear: I don't believe government, which taxes people regardless of their faith, should espouse a specific faith. I also don't think we should allow a small minority of atheists to sanitize our civil dialogue on religious references." In June 2011, Perry proclaimed August 6 as a Day of Prayer and Fasting, inviting other governors to join him in a prayer meeting hosted by the American Family Association in Houston.Bacon, Perry, Jr.; Henderson, Nia-Malika (August 5, 2011). "Texas Gov. Rick Perry to host major prayer event in Houston". The Washington Post. The event was criticized as going beyond prayer and fasting to include launching Perry's presidential campaign. Perry has called himself "a firm believer in intelligent design as a matter of faith and intellect", and has expressed support for its teaching alongside evolution in Texas schools, but has also said that "educators and local school officials, not the governor, should determine science curriculum". Perry has repeatedly attacked the Robin Hood plan to provide court-mandated equitable school financing for all school districts in the state. In 2005, following rejection of Perry's proposal to replace the Robin Hood plan, Perry vetoed all funding for public schools for the 2007–2008 biennium, saying he would not "approve an education budget that shortchanges teacher salary increases, textbooks, education technology, and education reforms. And I cannot let $2 billion sit in some bank account when it can go directly to the classroom." Following a second rejection of Perry's bill, Perry asked John Sharp to head a task force charged with preparing a bipartisan education plan, which was subsequently adopted. In 2001, Perry expressed his pride in the enactment of the statute extending in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants who meet Texas' residency requirements. It also required the undocumented students to pledge to apply for permanent residency or citizenship if this became a possibility for them. In September 2014, Gov. Perry stated during a debate his continuous support for the program. In 2002, Perry described as "appropriate" Texas's same-sex anti-sodomy law. The following year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the statute in Lawrence v. Texas, determining that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In his 2010 book, Perry referenced the Lawrence decision, writing "Texans have a different view of the world than do the nine oligarchs in robes."Arlette Saenz, Perry Draws Blank on Landmark Texas Anti-Sodomy Supreme Court Case, ABC News (December 29, 2011). In 2011, Perry admitted that he did not know about the Lawrence decision; when told that the Supreme Court case had struck down the Texas's anti-sodomy law, Perry said: "I'm not taking the bar exam ... I don't know what a lot of legal cases involve" and stated, "My position on traditional marriage is clear and I don't know need a law. I don't need a federal law case to explain it to me." Perry supported Texas Proposition 2 in 2005, a ballot proposition which amended the Texas constitution by defining marriage as "only a union between a man and a woman" and prohibiting the state from creating or recognizing "any legal status identical or similar to marriage" (such as civil unions). In 2011, after New York legalized same-sex marriage, Perry stated that it was their right to do so under the principle of states' rights in the Tenth Amendment. A spokesman later reiterated Perry's support for a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, saying that position was not inconsistent, since an amendment would require ratification by three-fourths of the states. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by the Constitution, Perry condemned the decision, saying: "I'm a firm believer in traditional marriage, and I also believe the 10th Amendment leaves it to each state to decide this issue."Jennifer Rubin, The GOP contenders react to the same-sex marriage decision, Washington Post (June 26, 2015). In his first book, On My Honor, published in 2008, Perry drew a parallel between homosexuality and alcoholism, writing that he is "no expert on the 'nature versus nurture' debate" but that gays should simply choose abstinence. During the 2012 presidential campaign, he criticized the repeal of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy for the U.S. military. Perry also said that using foreign aid as a policy tool against foreign countries which do not violate the human rights of homosexuals was "not in America's interests" and was part of a "war on traditional American values." Perry, an Eagle Scout, has called on the Boy Scouts to continue their ban on homosexuality and blamed America for not living up to the ideals of the scouts.Associated Press, Perry Fights Letting Gays in Boy Scouts (February 2, 2013). Perry's campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor focused on a tough stance on crime. He has supported block grants for crime programs. Jeff L. Blackburn, chief counsel of the Innocence Project of Texas, said of Perry that "He has done more good than any other governor we've ever had ... unless, of course, it involves the death penalty. On the death penalty, Rick Perry has a profound mental block."Sontag, Deborah (October 30, 2011). "Perry Displays Varied Stance Toward Crime". The New York Times. In 2007, Perry signed a law ending automatic arrest for cannabis possession.Yoder, Steve (November 7, 2011). "The GOP, 'tough on crime' no more?" Salon.  Perry supports the death penalty. In June 2001, he vetoed a ban on the execution of mentally retarded inmates. As of September 18, 2014, there have been 278 executions since Perry first took office in December 2000. Cases in which Perry has been criticized for his lack of intervention include those of Cameron Todd Willingham, Frances Newton, and Mexican nationals José Medellín and Humberto Leal Garcia. Perry commuted the death sentence of Kenneth Foster, who was convicted of murder despite evidence that he was only present at the scene of the crime. Foster was convicted under a Texas law that makes co-conspirators liable in certain cases of homicide. In this case, it tied Foster to the triggerman. Perry raised doubts about the law and urged the legislature to re-examine the issue. "I believe the right and just decision is to commute Foster’s sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment," Perry said in a statement at the time. Perry also refused to grant a stay of execution in the case of Cameron Todd Willingham even though an investigation by the Texas Forensic Science Commission determined parts of the original investigation may not have looked at all of the evidence correctly. Perry called Willingham a “monster” and later replaced the chairman of the Science Commission. In 2001, Perry proposed the Trans-Texas Corridor, a $145+ billion-dollar project that would build multi-lane highways, rail lines and data lines from Oklahoma to Mexico, and from east to west in southern Texas. Instead of paying for the project with taxes, Perry proposed that it be partially financed, partially built and wholly operated by private contractors, who would subsequently receive all toll proceeds. All of Perry's gubernatorial opponents opposed the corridor project, as did the 2006 state party platforms of both the Democratic and Republican parties. After much contentious debate between supporters and opponents, an official decision of "no action" was issued by the Federal Highway Administration on July 20, 2010, formally ending the project. Perry has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association. He possesses a Concealed Carry License (CCL) and has signed a number of bills that increased CHL access.   Until 2011, Perry persistently denied aspirations to higher office; he was originally included on the 2012 presidential straw poll ballot at the Values Voter Summit in September 2009, but his name was removed at his request. In April 2008 while appearing as a guest on CNBC's Kudlow & Company, he specifically stated that he would not agree to serve as Vice President in a McCain administration, stating that he already had "the best job in the world" as governor of Texas. Further, during a Republican gubernatorial debate in January 2010, when asked if he would commit to serving out his term if re-elected, he replied that "the place hasn't been made yet" where he would rather serve than the governor of Texas. In December 2010, when asked if he was a "definite maybe" to run for president in 2012, he replied, "a definite no, brother". On May 27, 2011, he said he was "going to think about" running for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination after the close of the Texas legislative session. Perry said in a response to a question from a reporter, "but I think about a lot of things", adding a grin. On August 11, a Perry spokesman said that he would be running for president in 2012, with plans to announce his formal entry into the race the next day. Perry himself confirmed it on a visit to KVUE, the ABC affiliate in Austin.  As the Associated Press bulletin announcing his entry into the race came across the wire, Perry signed and dated a printed copy of the bulletin.Bergamo, Jim (August 11, 2011). "Spokesman says Perry running for president". Austin, TX: KVUE. On August 13, Perry officially announced that he would be running for president. After announcing his candidacy, Perry immediately became a serious contender in the race, with a poll released by Rasmussen Reports on August 16, 2011, showing him leading in the Republican field at 29 percent, with the eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney at a distant second at 18 percent and the then-front runner Michele Bachmann at 13 percent. Perry hoped that Texas' own record of job growth in contrast to the rest of the country could persuade voters that he could reverse the economic downturn.  However, by September Perry's campaign began to suffer following a number of poor debate performances. Perry suffered further after a November 2011 debate: in the debate, he stated that, as president, he would eliminate three government agencies, but he was then only able to name two of the agencies—he was unable to name the third. He later identified the third agency as the Department of Energy. In October 2011, the Washington Post reported that Perry's family leases a hunting camp once called "Niggerhead." According to some local residents interviewed by the Post, the Perrys used the camp for years before painting over a large rock with that name on it, which stands at an entrance to the area, and during this time Perry hosted friends and supporters at the camp. Perry's campaign disputed the claims, stating that the Perrys painted over the rock almost immediately after acquiring a lease on the property in 1983. The Washington Post news reporter filing the October 1, 2011, news report interviewed seven people "who spoke in detail of their memories of seeing the rock with the name at various points during the years that Perry was associated with the property through his father, partners or his signature on a lease." On December 6, Perry's campaign released a YouTube advertisement (entitled "Strong") in which Perry discusses his religious beliefs and criticizes the Obama administration. Perry says in the video: "there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military, but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.W. Gardner Selby, Rick Perry says kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school, PolitiFact (December 7, 2011). The fact-checking website PolitiFact noted that Perry's assertion that "kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school" is false, and the video was widely criticized online, receiving over 750,000 "dislikes" on YouTube. Perry came in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses and skipped the New Hampshire primary. With polls showing Perry trailing in the upcoming South Carolina primary, Perry announced on January 19, 2012, that he would be dropping out of the 2012 presidential race. Perry initially endorsed Newt Gingrich, and then endorsed Mitt Romney in April after Gingrich announced that he was suspending his campaign. Following the end of his third full term, he had served over 14 consecutive years in office.

However, Perry decided not to run for re-election to a fourth full term, announcing, in front of family and supporters at the Holt Cat Headquarters in San Antonio, Texas, on July 8, 2013, that he would retire instead. Perry retired with the 10th longest gubernatorial tenure in United States history at the end of his term on January 20, 2015 at 5,144 days as well as the record of the longest serving Texas Governor.  Almost immediately following the 2012 election, Perry was mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidency in the 2016 presidential election, with a Time magazine article in July 2013 saying that "everything is aligned for Rick Perry to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016." Perry officially launched his 2016 presidential candidacy on June 4, 2015, in Addison, Texas.  A version of the Colt Ford song "Answer To No One" boomed from loudspeakers, as Perry took to the stage.Katz, Celeste.  Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry announces 2016 presidential bid, New York Daily News (June 4, 2015).Paulson, Dave. Rick Perry's country-rap song comes from Nashville, The Tennessean (June 5, 2015). He then announced his candidacy at the scheduled press conference. Perry withdrew on September 11, 2015&mdash;becoming the first in the field of major candidates to drop out&mdash;following poor polling after the first debate. In the weeks before he dropped from the race, Perry's campaign was in dire financial straits, spending nearly four times as much as it raised.Patrick Svitek, Records: Perry Campaign Bled Cash in Final Weeks, Texas Tribune (October 15, 2015). On January 25, 2016 Perry endorsed Ted Cruz for president. The Third Court of Appeals considered Perry's interlocutory appeal from a decision by Judge Bert Richardson denying his motion to dismiss the indictment.Svitek, Patrick.  "Indictment Cuts Both Ways as Perry Launches Bid", The Texas Tribune (June 3, 2015). On July 24, 2015, the Texas Third Court of Appeals dismissed the indictment for coercion of a public official, on the basis that the indictment violates his First Amendment rights to free speech. The indictment for abuse of power, a charge which his lawyers say is a misdemeanor, remains against Perry. The charge carries a potential prison sentence of 5 to 99 years. On August 15, 2014, Perry was indicted by a Travis County grand jury. The first charge of the indictment is abuse of official capacity, a first-degree felony, for threatening to veto $7.5 million in funding for the Public Integrity Unit, a state public corruption prosecutors department.  The second charge, which has since been ruled unconstitutional, was coercion of a public servant, a third-degree felony, for seeking the resignation of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, after she was convicted of drunk driving, and incarcerated. Perry pleaded not guilty to both charges.
