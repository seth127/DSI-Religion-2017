    Sesame Workshop (SW, or "the Workshop"), formerly known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), is an American non-profit organization behind the production of several educational children's programs—including its first and best-known, Sesame Street—that have run on public broadcasting around the world. Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and foundation executive Lloyd Morrisett came up with the idea to form an organization to oversee the production of Sesame Street, a television show which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new show. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade". Sesame Street premiered on PBS in the United States in November 1969, and the Workshop was formally incorporated shortly after, in 1970. Gerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to conduct research for the show; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the "CTW model". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of Sesame Street, they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other TV shows. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty in finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments hurt the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985. After Sesame Streets initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were made up of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW expanded into other areas, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and outreach programs to preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million. By 2008, the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney stepped down as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement. In 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop, to better reflect its entry into beyond television and interactive media, and Gary Knell became CEO. H. Melvin Ming replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, H. Melvin Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn. In the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.Hellman, Peter. (23 November 1987).

Retrieved 26 December 2013 Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned higher grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families, however, had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested "substantially lower"Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 5 than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school.Lesser, Gerald S. and Joel Schneider (2001) "Creation and Evolution of the Sesame Street Curriculum".

In attendance was her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially.Davis, p. 12 Cooney was a producer of documentary films at New York public broadcasting station Channel 13, and won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America.O'Dell, p. 68 Lloyd Morrisett was a vice-president at Carnegie Corporation, and was responsible for funding educational research, but had been frustrated in his efforts because they were unable to reach the large numbers of children in need of early education and intervention.Davis, p. 15 Cooney was committed to using television to change society, and Morrisett was interested in using television to "reach greater numbers of needy kids".Davis, p. 61 The conversation during the party, which according to writer Michael Davis was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett, turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children.Davis, p. 16 A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the offices of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study on creating an educational television program for preschoolers.Morrow, p. 47 Cooney was chosen to conduct the study. In the summer of 1967, Cooney took a leave of absence from Channel 13, and funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education".Davis, pp. 66–67 The report described what the new show, which became Sesame Street, would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). For the next two years, Cooney and Morrisett worked on researching and developing the new show, raising $8 million for Sesame Street, and establishing the CTW.Morrow, p. 71 Due to her professional experience, Cooney always assumed the show's natural home would be PBS. Morrisett was open to airing it on commercial stations, but all three networks rejected the idea.  Davis, considering Sesame Streets stream of licensing income in the decades to come, called their decision "a billion-dollar blunder".Davis, p. 114 Morrisett was responsible for fund-raising, and was so successful at it that writer Lee D. Mitgang later said that it "defied conventional media wisdom".  Cooney was responsible for the show's creative development, and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW.Davis, p. 105  The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $1 million grant, and Morrisett, using his contacts, procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Ford Foundation.Davis, p. 8  Morrisett's friend Harold Howe, who was the commissioner for the U.S. Department of Education, promised $4 million, half of the new organization's budget.  The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $1 million.Mitgang, pp. 16—17  Mitgang stated, "Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support, Cooney's report likely would have become just another long-forgotten foundation idea".Mitgang, p. 17  Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial networks, but caused challenges in procuring future funding.Lesser, p. 17 Cooney's proposal included using in-house formative research that would inform and improve production, and independent summative evaluations to test the show's impact on its young viewers' learning.Fisch, Shalom M. and Lewis Bernstein (2001) "Formative Research Revealed: Methodological and Process Issues in Formative Research".

Lesser, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale,Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 8 to help develop and lead the Workshop's research department. In 1972, the Markle Foundation donated $72,000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children's Television, which served as a research arm for the CTW.  Harvard produced about 20 major research studies about Sesame Street and its effect on young children.Mitgang, p. 45  Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop's advisory board, a position he held until his retirement in 1997."Remembering Professor, Emeritus, Gerald Lesser" (24 September 2010). Harvard Graduate School of Education. Accessed 25 December 2013 According to Lesser, the CTW's advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber-stamping the Workshop's decisions like most boards for other children's TV shows, its contributed significantly to the show's design and implementation.Lesser, pp. 42—43 Lesser reported in Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street, his 1974 book about the beginnings of Sesame Street and the Children's Television Workshop, that roughly 8—10% of the Workshop's initial budget was spent on research.Lesser, p. 132 CTW's summative research was done by the Workshop's first research director, Edward L. Palmer, whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston in the summer of 1967. In the summer of 1968, Palmer began to create educational goals, define the Workshop's research activities, and hire his research team.Lesser, p. 39 Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying children and television at the time.Davis, p. 144 They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the "CTW model".Morrow, p. 68Cooney, Joan Ganz (1974).

Morrow called "an extensive campaign"Morrow, p. 112 that Lesser stated "would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research", the Workshop promoted the show with educators, the broadcast industry, and the show's target audience, which consisted of inner-city children and their families. They hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable",Davis, p. 154 as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division. Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new show, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention that surrounded Sesame Street its first year of production.Lesser, p. 40 According to Davis, despite her leadership in the project's initial research and development, Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was put in doubt due to her lack of high-level managerial experience and leadership, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience in children's television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, "Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries".Davis, p. 124 At first, Cooney did not fight for the position. However she had the support of her husband and Morrisett, and the project's investors soon realized they could not go forward without her. She was eventually named to the post in February 1968.  As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".Davis, pp. 125–126 The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on 20 May 1968.Davis, p. 127 After her appointment, Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant; he was responsible to making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to air the new show.Lesser, p. 41 She assembled a team of producers:Finch, Christopher (1993).

Morrisett used the same fund-raising techniques as he had used for Sesame Street.Davis, p. 216 The Electric Company stopped production in 1977, but continued in re-runs until 1985; it eventually became one of the most widely used TV shows in American classroomsO'Dell, p. 75 and was revived in 2009.Davis, Michael (12 May 2008).

According to writer Cary O'Dell, the show "lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience".O'Dell, p. 74 In 1977, the Workshop aired an adult drama called Best of Families, which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century, but it lasted for six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to focus on children's programs only.Shirley Wershba (27 April 1998)."Joan Ganz Cooney, Part 5" (Video clip).

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget, but by 1981, government funding for Sesame Street had been terminated.Davis, pp. 218–219O'Dell, pp. 73—74 For the first time, a public broadcasting show had the potential to earn a great deal of money.  Immediately after its premiere, Sesame Street gained attention from marketers, so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a "multiple media institution".Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 197 Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow put it, the Sesame Workshop endowment,Gikow, p. 268 which had the potential to support the organization and fund future productions and projects. Muppet creator Jim Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during airings of Sesame Street.Davis, pp. 203–205 As Davis reported, "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" in their marketing and licensing efforts.Davis, p. 204 In the early 1970s, the CTW approached Random House to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division.

The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would "underscore and amplify" the show's curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children's imaginations. The CTW published Sesame Street Magazine in 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format.Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 198 As with the show, research was conducted for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975. Working with Random House editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to run Sesame Streets book publishing program. In the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He left to become more involved with writing and composing music for the show,Davis, p. 206 and was eventually replaced by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2009, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model followed by other children's shows. As of 2001, there were over 600 books available in the Sesame Street library,Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 209 and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated, "the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street". In one of these books, for example, the death of the Sesame Street character Mr. Hooper was dealt with in a book entitled I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper, published shortly after the show dealt with it in 1983.Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 210  According to director Jon Stone, the music of Sesame Street was unlike any other children's program on television.Gikow, p. 220 For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum.Gikow, p. 227 Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an "affinity for commercial jingles",Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 17 so many of the show's songs were constructed like television ads. To attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the show, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, "helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show".Davis, p. 256 Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts. Songwriters of note were Joe Raposo, Jeff Moss, Christopher Cerf, Tony Geiss, and Norman Stiles. Many of the songs written for Sesame Street have become what writer David Borgenicht called "timeless classics".Borgenicht, David (1998). Sesame Street Unpaved. New York: Hyperion Publishing. p. 145.

Shortly after Sesame Street debuted in the US, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show in their countries.Cole et al. in Fisch & Truglio, p. 147 Cooney remarked, "To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created".Knowlton, Linda Goldstein and Linda Hawkins Costigan (producers) (2006). The World According to Sesame Street (documentary). Participant Productions. She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to field offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, "After [Dann] sells [Sesame Street] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".Davis, p. 209 This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the show.Guernsey, Lisa (23 May 2009). "How Sesame Street Changed the World". Newsweek. Retrieved 22 January 2014  By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call "co-productions".  The earliest international versions were what CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues called "fairly simple", consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it.Gikow, p. 252 Eventually, a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries. By 2006, there were twenty co-productions. In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.Gikow, p. 263 In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of The New York Times reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million.Carvajal, Doreen (12 December 2005). "Sesame Street Goes Global: Let's All Count the Revenue". The New York Times. Retrieved 22 January 2014 As Cole and her colleagues reported in 2001, "Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world". Ten years after the premiere of Sesame Street, the CTW began experimenting with new technologies. In 1979, it began to plan the development of a theme park, Sesame Place, which opened in 1980 in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.Revelle et al. in Fisch & Truglio, p. 215  Three international parks, Parque Plaza Sesamo in Monterrey, Mexico since 1995, Universal Studios Japan, and Vila Sesamo Kids' Land in Brazil were later built.Gikow, p. 284 One of the park's features was a computer gallery, which was developed by a small in-house team and included 55 computer programs. The team evolved into the Children's Computer Workshop (CCW) in 1982, which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW in the late 1980s.Gikow, p. 282 As Sesame Street researcher Shalom M. Fisch pointed out, no television show could be as interactive as computer games, even "participatory"Fisch, Shalom M. (2004). Children's Learning from Educational Television: Sesame Street and Beyond. Mahweh, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 199.

The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television show's content and curriculum.Revelle et al. in Fisch & Truglio , p. 217 In 2008, a new "research-driven" website was created; it reached 18 million downloads in one month. Also in 2008, the Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full-length episodes on Hulu, YouTube, and iTunes, where "Word on the Street" segments became the most popular webcast.Gikow, p. 285 In 2010, the Workshop began offering eBooks through the show's website, including a free rotating selection of five titles. Their selection of eBooks came in a variety of formats, some of which were interactive, and covered nineteen subject areas, including letters, numbers, counting, colors, and cultural appreciation."Sesame Street eBookstore Debuts with Collection of More Than 100 Titles" (Press release).
