  Samuel GompersHis name sometimes appears as "Samuel L. Gompers", but he had no middle name. (January 27, 1850 – December 13, 1924) was an English-born American cigar maker who became a Georgist labor union leader and a key figure in American labor history. Gompers founded the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and served as the organization's president from 1886 to 1894 and from 1895 until his death in 1924. He promoted harmony among the different craft unions that comprised the AFL, trying to minimize jurisdictional battles. He promoted thorough organization and collective bargaining to secure shorter hours and higher wages, the first essential steps, he believed, to emancipating labor. He also encouraged the AFL to take political action to "elect their friends" and "defeat their enemies". During World War I, Gompers and the AFL openly supported the war effort,Gompers Pledges Labor's Support for WWI, History Channel Online, retrieved 21 July 2011Venzon, Anne C. and Miles, Paul L., The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia, Routledge Press, ISBN 0-8153-3353-6, ISBN 978-0-8153-3353-1 (1999), p. 261 attempting to avoid strikes and boost morale while raising wage rates and expanding membership. Samuel Gompers was born on January 27, 1850, in London, into a Jewish family which originally hailed from Amsterdam.Samuel Gompers, Seventy Years of Life and Labor. 1925; vol. 1, p. 2. When he was six, Samuel was sent to the Jewish Free School where he received a basic education. His elementary school career was brief, however, as a mere three months after his 10th birthday, Gompers was removed from school and sent to work as an apprentice cigarmaker to help earn money for his impoverished family.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, p. 6. Gompers was able to continue his studies in night school, however, during which time he learned Hebrew and studied the Talmud, a process which he long later recalled was akin to studying law.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, pp. 6-7. While familiar with the ancient Hebrew language, Gompers did not speak it and held a lifelong disdain for Yiddish.In his posthumously-published memoirs, Gompers notes, "I was taught Hebrew—not the mongrel language spoken and written by many Jews of the present age." See: Gompers, Seventy Years of Life and Labor, vol. 1, p. 6.  Owing to dire financial straits, the Gompers family immigrated to the United States in 1863, settling on Manhattan's Lower East Side in New York City. Gompers' father was engaged in the manufacture of cigars at home, assisted for the first year and half by Samuel.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, pp. 24, 35. In his free time, the young teenager formed a debate club with his friends, an activity which provided practical experience in public speaking and parliamentary procedure.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, p. 28. The club drew Gompers into contact with other upwardly mobile young men of the city, including a young Irish-American named Peter J. McGuire who would later play a large role in the AFL. In 1864, at the age of 14, Gompers joined and became involved in the activities of Cigarmakers' Local Union No. 15, the English-speaking union of cigar makers in New York City.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, p. 38.  Gompers later recounted his days as a cigar maker at the bench in detail, emphasizing the place of craftsmanship in the production process: The day after his 17th birthday, he married his co-worker, 16-year-old Sophia Julian.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, pp. 35-36. They had a series of children in rapid succession, with six surviving infancy. In 1873, Gompers moved to the cigarmaker David Hirsch & Company, a "high-class shop where only the most skilled workmen were employed".Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, p. 68. Gompers later called this change of employers "one of the most important changes in my life", for at Hirsch's—a union shop operated by an émigré German socialist—Gompers came into contact with an array of German-speaking cigarmakers—"men of keener mentality and wider thought than any I had met before," he recalled.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, pp. 68-69. Gompers learned German and absorbed many of the ideas of his shopmates, developing a particular admiration for the ideas of the former secretary of the International Workingmen's Association, Karl Laurrell.Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, p. 70. Laurrell took Gompers under his wing, challenging his more simplistic ideas and urging Gompers to put his faith in the organized economic movement of trade unionism rather than the socialist political movement. Gompers later recalled: Gompers complained that the socialist movement had been captured by Lassallean advocates of "political party action" rather than the "militant economic program of Marx".Gompers, Seventy Year of Life and Labor, vol. 1, p. 84.   He warned delegates to the 1900 annual convention that when men became enthusiastic about socialism, "they usually lost interest in their union".Stuart Bruce Kaufman, Peter J. Albert and Grace Palladino, eds. The Samuel Gompers Papers (1996) vol 5 p 284 Gompers was elected president of Cigarmakers' International Union Local 144 in 1875. As was the case with other unions of the day, the Cigarmaker's Union nearly collapsed in the financial crisis of 1877, in which unemployment skyrocketed and ready availability of desperate workers willing to labor for subsistence wages put pressure upon the gains in wages and shortening of hours achieved in union shops. Gompers and his friend Adolph Strasser used Local 144 as a base to rebuild the Cigarmakers' Union, introducing a high dues structure and implementing programs to pay out-of-work benefits, sick benefits, and death benefits for union members in good standing. Gompers told the workers they needed to organize because wage reductions were almost a daily occurrence. The capitalists were only interested in profits, "and the time has come when we must assert our rights as workingmen. Every one present has the sad experience, that we are powerless in an isolated condition, while the capitalists are united; therefore it is the duty of every Cigar Maker to join the organization. ...  One of the main objects of the organization," he concluded, "is the elevation of the lowest paid worker to the standard of the highest, and in time we may secure for every person in the trade an existence worthy of human beings."Mandel, Samuel Gompers: A Biography, 1963, p. 22. He was elected second vice-president of the Cigarmakers' International Union in 1886, and first vice-president in 1896. Despite the commitment of time and energy entailed by his place as head of the American Federation of Labor, Gompers remained first vice-president of the Cigarmakers until his death in December 1924. Gompers helped found the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions in 1881 as a coalition of like-minded unions. In 1886 it was reorganized into the American Federation of Labor, with Gompers as its president. He would remain president of the organization until his death (with the exception of one year, 1895). Under Gompers's tutelage, the AFL coalition gradually gained strength, undermining the position previously held by the Knights of Labor, which as a result had almost vanished by 1900. He was nearly jailed in 1911 for publishing with John Mitchell a boycott list, but the Supreme Court overturned the sentence in Gompers v. Buck's Stove and Range Co.. Gompers, who had ties with the Cuban cigar workers in the U.S., called for American intervention in Cuba; he supported the resulting war with Spain in 1898.  After the war, however, he joined the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose President William McKinley's plan to annex the Philippines. Mandel (1963) argues that his anti-imperialism was based on opportunistic fears of threats to labor's status from low-paid offshore workers and was founded on a sense of racial superiority to the peoples of the Philippines.Mandel, Gompers pp 201-204 By the 1890s Gompers was planning an international federation of labor, starting with the expansion of AFL affiliates in Canada, especially Ontario. He helped the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress with money and organizers, and by 1902 the AFL dominated the Canadian union movement.Robert H. Babcock, Gompers in Canada: A Study in American Continentalism before the First World War (1974) Gompers, like most labor leaders of his era, opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe because it lowered wages and opposed all immigration from Asia because it lowered wages and represented, in his judgement, an alien culture that could not be easily assimilated. He and the AFL strongly supported the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that banned the immigration of Chinese.Thousands of Chinese entered the U.S. illegally, but nearly all lived and worked in Chinatowns where they did not compete with union labor. The restrictions were repealed in 1943.  The AFL was instrumental in passing immigration restriction laws from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the Immigration Act of 1924, and seeing that they were strictly enforced. At least one study concludes that the link between the AFL and the Democratic Party rested in large part on immigration issues, as the owners of large corporations wanted more immigration and thus supported the Republican Party.Mink, Old Labor and New Immigrants in American Political Development: Union, Party, and State, 1875-1920, 1986. Other scholars have seriously questioned this conclusion, arguing it oversimplifies the politics and unity of labor leaders and the major parties. As one reviewer argued in The Journal of American History, major Republican leaders such as President William McKinley and Senator Mark Hanna made pro-labor statements, many unions supported their own independent labor parties, and unity within the AFL was never as extensive as claimed.Asher, "Review: Gwendolyn Mink, Old Labor and New Immigrants in American Political Development: Union, Party, and State, 1875-1920," Journal of American History, March 1988. During World War I Gompers was a strong supporter of the war effort. He was appointed by President Wilson to the Council of National Defense, where he chaired the Labor Advisory Board. He attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 as an official advisor on labor issues.Frank L. Grubbs, The Struggle for Labor Loyalty: Gompers, the A. F. of L., and the Pacifists, 1917–1920. (1968). During a severe period of national economic recession in the early 1890s, labor unrest was at its height. A volatile situation in Chicago in August 1893 caused the city’s then mayor, Carter Henry Harrison, to warn that the preponderance of the unemployed would lead to riots that would “shake the country” unless Congress interceded. In late August 1893, Gompers addressed 25,000 unemployed workers who had massed on the shore of Lake Michigan.  As reported in the Chicago Tribune on August 31, Gompers inveighed against the controllers of capital and the titans of industry and finance. “Why should the wealth of the country be stored in banks and elevators while the idle workman wanders homeless about the streets and the idle loafers who hoard the gold only to spend it on riotous living are rolling about in fine carriages from which they look out on peaceful meetings and call them riots?”Larson, Erik, "Devil In The White City, Crown Publishers, 2003, p. 315 Gompers began his labor career familiar with, and sympathetic to, Georgism and the precepts of socialism,A Pictorial History of American Labor, William Cahn, 1972, page 139. but gradually adopted a more conservative approach to labor relations. Labor Historian Melvyn Dubofsky has written, "By 1896 Gompers and the AFL were moving to make their peace with Capitalism and the American system." Although the AFL had once preached the inevitability of class conflict and the need to abolish 'wage slavery', it slowly and almost imperceptibly began to proclaim the virtues of class harmony and the possibilities of a more benevolent Capitalism."Melvyn Dubofsky, 'Big Bill' Haywood, 1987, page 17. For example, Alex Heron attributes the following quote to Gompers: "The greatest crime an employer can perpetrate on his employees is to fail to operate at a profit".Heron, Professor A (1954) Reasonable Goals In Industrial Relations, Stanford University Press, https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rC6iAAAAIAAJ Gompers began to take a neutral stance in politics after his failure to successfully elect Henry George as mayor of New York, but Gompers remained a Single Tax Georgist later in life. Gompers's philosophy of labor unions centered on economic ends for workers, such as higher wages, shorter hours, and safe working conditions so that they could enjoy an "American" standard of living—a decent home, decent food and clothing, and money enough to educate their children.Bernard Mandel, "Gompers and Business Unionism, 1873-90". Business History Review 28:3 (September 1954) He thought economic organization was the most direct way to achieve these improvements, but he did encourage union members to participate in politics and to vote with their economic interests in mind. Gompers's trade union philosophy and his devotion to collective bargaining with business proved to be too conservative for more radical leaders such as Ed Boyce, president of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), and, later, WFM secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood. In 1905, Haywood and the WFM helped to establish the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, whose members were known as Wobblies), with the goal of organizing the entire working class. The IWW's long-term goal was to supplant capitalism with a workers' commonwealth.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World. (2000) Nonetheless, when government abuses against the leaders of the WFM seemed too egregious, Gompers relented and offered assistance.Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, page 97. Gompers and his AFL unions vigorously fought the IWW in the U.S. and in Latin America, as a disruptive dual union that tried harder to destroy capitalism than to help workers. He cooperated with widespread government arrests of union leaders for the IWW's militant opposition to the World War. He said, "the IWW's...are exactly what the Bolsheviki are in Russia, and we have seen what the IWW Bolsheviki in Russia have done for the working people."Charles W. Toth, "Samuel Gompers, Communism, and the Pan American Federation of Labor," The Americas (1967): 273-278. in JSTOR The IWW was practically defunct by 1920. Gompers led the anti-Socialist faction inside the AFL, losing to them only once in 1894. He argued that socialists believed workers and unions could never co-exist with business interests and wanted to use the labor unions to advance their more radical political causes.  By 1920 Gompers had largely marginalized Socialist influence to a few unions, notably coal miners and the needle trades.John H.M. Laslett, Labor and the left: a study of socialist and radical influences in the American labor movement, 1881-1924 (1970) Gompers was a leading Freemason, reaching the 32º in the Scottish Rite Valley of Washington in 1906.  In 1920 he wrote, "In my Masonic life I have visited lodges in many lands, and I have learned that Freemasonry in many countries, particularly in Latin countries, is the principal means whereby freedom of conscience, of thought, and expression is preserved." Gompers' health went into serious decline starting in February 1923, when a serious bout of influenza sent him to the hospital, sidelining him from work for six weeks.Peter J. Albert and Grace Palladino, "Introduction" to The Samuel Gompers Papers: Volume 12: The Last Years, 1922-24. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2010; p. xx. No sooner had he recovered from the flu than he was stricken by a case of bronchitis that laid him low again. By June 1924 Gompers, who suffered from diabetes, could no longer walk without assistance, and he was hospitalized again, this time suffering from congestive heart failure and uremia. He collapsed in Mexico City on Saturday, December 6, 1924, while attending a meeting of the Pan-American Federation of Labor.The cause of the collapse was probably myocardial infarction, although no medical diagnosis was ever reported. It was recognized that his condition was critical and that he might not survive for long. Gompers expressed the desire to die on American soil, and he was placed aboard a special train and sped toward the border."End Comes On Home Soil," Associated Press, December 14, 1924. Gompers was buried at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Gompers is buried only a few yards away from industrialist Andrew Carnegie, another important figure of industry in the Gilded Age. Gompers inspired later generations of labor leaders, such as George Meany, who paid tribute to Gompers as a European immigrant who pioneered a distinctly American brand of unionism.June 18, 1961, entry in Journals of David E. Lilienthal, 1971.  His belief led to the development of procedures for collective bargaining and contracts between labor and management which are still in use today. In practice, AFL unions were important in industrial cities, where they formed a central labor office to coordinate the actions of different AFL unions. Issues of wages and hours were the usual causes of strikes, but many strikes were assertions of jurisdiction, so that the plumbers, for example, used strikes to ensure that all major construction projects in the city used union plumbers. In this goal they were ideally supported by all the other construction unions in the AFL fold.Philip Taft, The A.F. of L. in the Time of Gompers (1957);  Mandel (1954) Gompers is the subject of statuary in several major American cities. A bronze monument honoring Gompers by the sculptor Robert Aitken resides in Gompers Square on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C.. On September 3, 2007, a life-size statue of Gompers was unveiled at Gompers Park, named after the labor leader in 1929, on the northwest side of Chicago. This is the first statue of a labor leader in Chicago. Local unions throughout Chicago donated their time and money to build the monument."Samuel Gompers Statue Unveiled", press release, Office of Ald. Margaret Laurino, City of Chicago, September 3, 2007. Gompers also had a U.S. Navy support ship and a class of U.S. Navy destroyer tenders named for him. The Samuel Gompers Houses, a public housing development on the Lower East Side of New York, is also named in his honor.               It was difficult to organize certain Black workers, because, being only half a century removed from slavery, they did not have the same conception of their rights and duties as did the white workers and were unprepared for fully exercising and enjoying the possibilities existing in trade unionism.Mandel, "Samuel Gompers and the Negro Workers," 56. Mandel points out (pp.56–57 n58) that Gompers believed in 1915 that "there are now two great groups of exploited workers in the United States—immigrants and women", ignoring Blacks altogether. More significant is the fact that Gompers devoted only two sentences to the subject in his 1,100-page autobiography, in which he blithely affirms the right of Blacks to organize. Samuel Gompers, Seventy Years of Life and Labor: An Autobiography, vol. 1 (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1925), 364. See also Karson and Radosh, The American Federation of Labor and the Negro Worker, 160. So long as we have held fast to voluntary principles and have been actuated and inspired by the spirit of service, we have sustained our forward progress, and we have made our labor movement something to be respected and accorded a place in the councils of the Republic. Where we have blundered into trying to force a policy or decision, even though wise and right, we have impeded if not interrupted the realization of our own aims. No lasting gain has ever come from compulsion. If we seek to force, we but tear apart that which united, is invincible. There is no way whereby our labor movement may be assured sustained progress in determining its policies and its plans other than sincere democratic deliberation until a unanimous decision is reached. This may seem a cumbrous, slow method to the impatient, but the impatient are more concerned for immediate triumph than for the education of constructive development.Foner, Philip S. History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The T.U.E.L. to the End of the Gompers Era. New York: International Publishers Co, 1991, p. 361–362. The worst crime against working people is a company which fails to operate at a profit.Quoted in Rothschild, Michael. Bionomics: Economy as Business Ecosystem. Washington, D.C.: BeardBooks, 1990, p. 115. What does labor want?  We want more school houses and less jails.  More books and less guns. More learning and less vice.  More leisure and less greed.  More justice and less revenge. We want more ... opportunities to cultivate our better natures.Quoted in Mantsios, Gregory. A New Labor Movement for the New Century. Florence, Ky.: Taylor & Francis, 1998, p. 51. There are about 8,000,000 negroes in the United States, and, my friends, I not only have not the power to put the negro out of the labor movement, but I would not, even if I did have the power. Why should I do such a thing? I would have nothing to gain, but the movement would have much to lose. Under our policies and principles we seek to build up the labor movement, instead of injuring it, and we want all the negroes we can possibly get who will join hands with organized labor.The Samuel Gompers Papers: Progress and Reaction in the Age of Reform, 1909-13 (2000), p. 137. And what have our unions done? What do they aim to do? To improve the standard of life, to uproot ignorance and foster education, to instill character, manhood and independent spirit among our people; to bring about a recognition of the interdependence of man upon his fellow man. We aim to establish a normal work-day, to take the children from the factory and workshop and give them the opportunity of the school and the play-ground. In a word, our unions strive to lighten toil, educate their members, make their homes more cheerful, and in every way contribute an earnest effort toward making life the better worth living.Gompers, Samuel. "Gompers Speaks for Labor". McClure's Magazine, February 1912, p. 376 In many instances the conduct of colored workmen, and those who have spoken for them, has not been in asking or demanding that equal rights be accorded to them as to white workmen, but somehow conveying the idea that they are to be petted and coddled and given special consideration and special privilege. Of course that can't be done.Gompers, Samuel. The Samuel Gompers Papers: The American Federation of Labor and the Great War, 1917–18. Stuart Bruce Kaufman, Peter J. Albert, and Grace Palladino, eds. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 2006, p. 348. [The labor movement is] a movement of the working people, for the working people, by the working people, governed by ourselves, with its policies determined by ourselves...Gompers, Samuel. Proceedings of the Convention. Washington, D.C.: American Federation of Labor, 1923, p. 37. The trade union movement represents the organized economic power of the workers. Through the development, the organization and the exercise of this economic power the workers themselves establish higher standards of living and work. Although this economic power from the superficial standpoint appears indirect, it is in reality the most potent and the most direct social insurance the workers can establish.Gompers, Samuel.
