Truman visits Temple University Martin Luther King, Jr. lecturing at Temple University Temple University was founded in 1884 by Russell Conwell, a Yale-educated Boston lawyer, orator, and ordained Baptist minister, who had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Conwell came to Pennsylvania in 1882 to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules. These students, later dubbed "night owls," were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple, hence the origin of the university's name and mascot. The Grace Baptist Church quickly grew popular within the North Philadelphia area. A temporary board of trustees was created to handle the rapidly growing formalities associated with the church's programs. When the board conducted its first meeting they named Russell H. Conwell president of "The Temple College." Within the following months, Grace Baptist Church appointed a new board of trustees, printed official admissions files, and issued stock to raise funds for new teaching facilities. Regardless of whether they had the resources to support the school, Conwell’s desire was “to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual channels”.http://www.usca.edu/essays/vol152005/lovik.pdf Philadelphia granted a charter in 1888 to establish “The Temple College of Philadelphia”, but the city refused to grant authority to award academic degrees. By 1888, the enrollment of the college was nearly 600. It was in 1907 that Temple College revised its institutional status and incorporated as a university. Legal recognition as a university enhanced Temple in noticeable ways including its reputation, professional and graduate programs, overall enrollment, and financial support. Over time, Temple expanded: Samaritan Hospital was founded, a Medical School was added, and Temple merged with the Philadelphia Dental College. After the merger, Temple officially reincorporated as Temple University on December 12, 1907. Today, Temple is a Pennsylvania state-related university, meaning the university receives state funds, subject to state appropriations, but is independently operated.

The Owls are also part of the Philadelphia Big 5, the Philadelphia-area basketball rivalry. Temple University was among the first institutions in the United States to sponsor extracurricular athletic activities for its students when both the football and basketball programs were inaugurated in 1894 under the direction of Coach Charles M. Williams. In 2013, Temple eliminated seven of its 24 sports programs, citing financial concerns.  Temple's football program dates back to 1894 and currently plays Division I FBS football in the American Athletic Conference.

That Owls team, which finished with a 23–2 record, won the inaugural National Invitation Tournament by routing Colorado 60-36 in the championship final. Because the NCAA Tournament was not held until the following year, Temple's NIT championship earned the Owls the first national college basketball title. During the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA Final Four appearances (1956, 1958) under legendary Head Coach Harry Litwack. Litwack would be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins.

Cherry and White are the official school colors of Temple University.

The only other large university that uses cherry is the University of New Mexico.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/tem/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/mg_history_06.pdf Cherry is a common motif at Temple, from the Cherry Crusade fan club to the Cherry and White Directory. In 2008, Temple standardized the cherry color to be Pantone Matching System (PMS) 201.http://news.temple.edu/temple-announces-new-official-color  The university's symbol, the Temple "T", was designed by Kristine Herrick at Temple's Tyler School of Art. It won a contest launched by President Peter J. Liacouras to celebrate the school's 100th anniversary, and was officially adopted in 1983.https://www.temple.edu/faculty-and-staff/business-services/logo-graphics-guide The Temple T is referenced in the fight song, T For Temple U'. Temple adopted the owl as its mascot in 1888, the first school in the nation to choose the bird. The nocturnal hunter symbolized Temple's early mission: to be a night school for ambitious young people of limited means. Russell Conwell encouraged these students, saying, "The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day." In 1977, Temple introduced "Victor T. Owl," a costumed mascot. Victor T. was renamed Hooter in 1984, and Hooter has remained Temple's mascot at sports games and events since.https://books.google.com/books?id=ebT3FL1jomsC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=temple+owl+traditions&source=bl&ots=DSg7a65U1c&sig=78R8jvid7tldZaRptDirzR64FKg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CG4Q6AEwDWoVChMI7JiC-b2dyAIVBD4-Ch3jsAXr#v=onepage&q=owl&f=false Stella, Temple's live owl mascot, was born in 2010 in Washington.

It is the burial place of Russell Conwell, founder and 38-year president of Temple. A former Yale student, Civil War captain, Boston lawyer, and Philadelphia minister, Conwell used the income from his famous “Acres of Diamonds” speech to fund Temple as a place where working-class Philadelphians might receive higher education. It has been estimated that Conwell, who died at 82, helped more than 100,000 men and women pursue higher education.   A bust of Conwell marks his grave. Off the faculty staff dining 'Diamond Club', this green area celebrates Conwell and Johnny Ring. It is often used for wedding photos.

Pearson, Prime Minister of Canada and recipient of the Nobel peace prize was awarded the Temple University World Peace Prize. During his acceptance speech Pearson criticised American bombing of Vietnam: There are many factors which I am not in a position to weigh. But there does appear to be at least a possibility that a suspension of such air strikes against North Vietnam, at the right time, might provide the Hanoi [communist] authorities with an opportunity, if they wish to take it, to inject some flexibility into their policy without appearing to do so as the direct result of military pressure.Stursburg, Peter, "Lester Pearson and the American Dilemma", Vietnam War: The Speech, Doubleday & Company, Inc, 1980, p.217 The speech infuriated President Lyndon B. Johnson who, the next day at Camp David, took Pearson out onto the terrace and began "laying into [Pearson] in no uncertain fashion". Pearson later apologized for the speech.Stursburg, Peter, "Lester Pearson and the American Dilemma", Vietnam War: The Speech, Doubleday & Company, Inc, 1980, p.218    USNWR departmental rankings Business 41 Clinical Psychology 26 Criminology 11 Education 56 Engineering 115 English 63 Fine Arts 13 Health Care Management 27 History 64 Law 52 Medical Research 55 Pharmacy 58 Psychology 52 Speech-Language Pathology 29 Name of College Dean Temple University School of Environmental Design William Stull (Interim Dean) Tyler School of Art Robert T.
