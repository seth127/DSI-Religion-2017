  The South Carolina Stingrays are a professional minor league ice hockey team based in North Charleston, South Carolina. The Stingrays play in the South Division of the ECHL's Eastern Conference. They play their home games at the North Charleston Coliseum. The Carolina Ice Palace, also located in North Charleston, serves as a practice facility and backup arena for the Stingrays. Established in 1993, the team has been owned by a conglomerate of local business owners since 1995. The team was affiliated with the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League and the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League starting in 2004 and ending in July 2012 when the Capitals announced their affiliation with the ECHL's Reading Royals. On June 26, 2014, the Washington Capitals announced an affiliation agreement with the Stingrays for the 2014–15 season. The Stingrays are the first professional ice hockey team established in the state of South Carolina. With the relocation of the Johnstown Chiefs to Greenville, South Carolina in 2010, the Stingrays became the oldest continuously operational ECHL franchise to remain in its founding city (the Wheeling Nailers have been in Wheeling since 1992 but are a relocated franchise). The Stingrays have finished with the best record in the ECHL once, and qualified for the playoffs for every season except one. With Kelly Cup championships in 1997, 2001 and 2009, the Stingrays are tied with the Hampton Roads Admirals and the Alaska Aces for the record for most league championships. Thirty former Stingrays players have gone on to play in the National Hockey League with one (Rich Peverley) winning the Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins in 2011. The team developed a large fan base rapidly following its inception. During its first season (1993&ndash;94) the team boasted an average of 9,151 fans a game&mdash;one of the largest crowds in minor league hockey. Recent years have seen a downward trend in attendance. During the 2011&ndash;12 season, the Stingrays averaged an all-time low 3,251 fans per game, though they rebounded in the 2012&ndash;13 season with an average 3,528 fans per game. The South Carolina Stingrays were founded in 1993 as an expansion team in the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). Its management team included Joseph Scanlon as president/CEO and retired National Hockey League (NHL) player Rick Vaive as head coach. The team was originally to be designated the South Carolina Sharks,S. 324 (1993-02-02).

Post and Courier. Retrieved 2010-11-09. In late 1993, Scanlon filed a lawsuit in a Canadian court in an attempt to wrest control of the team from its ownership group. He was replaced as president and CEO by retired NHL Hall of Fame member Marcel Dionne in December of that year. Dionne was accused of assault in February 1994 by Lynn Bernstein, an ally of Scanlon, over a dispute regarding the removal of advertising signs at the North Charleston Coliseum, but was later acquitted.MacDougall, David (1994-12-09). "Stingrays chief acquitted in assault". Post and Courier. Retrieved 2010-11-09. Following dismissal of Scanlon's lawsuit, the ECHL board of governors ended the power struggle when it approved the sale of the franchise from its Canadian ownership group to a local investment group led by Edwin Pearlstine, owner of Pearlstine Distribution, the local Budweiser distributor. The group also included Jerry and Anita Zucker, Harvey Nathan and Lynn Bernstein (owners of local restaurant Nathan's Deli), and the Greenwald family of Seabrook Island.

"Stingrays take on familiar foe tonight". Post and Courier. Retrieved 2011-07-30. Despite their early playoff exit, the team had several significant achievements during their inaugural season. Center Sylvain Fleury finished tenth among league skaters for total points with 95 points in 68 games played and scored a league season-high five goals in an 11&ndash;6 victory over the Greensboro Monarchs on December 26.  Left winger Andy Bezeau was second in the league in penalty minutes, accumulating 352 minutes in 36 games (29 fewer games than Trevor Buchanan, the league leader with 422 minutes). From January 19&ndash;28, the Stingrays went on a six-game winning streak wherein they totaled 43 goals for and only 13 goals against, including two games in which they scored 11 goals each against their opponents (one of which, against the Huntington Blizzard, had 67 shots on goal by the Stingrays). The team led the league in attendance with an average of 9,151 fans per game. In 1994&ndash;95, the team took the top spot in the Southern Division but were knocked out in the second round by the Nashville Knights.Namm, Keith (1995-04-09). "Good Knight to Stingrays' season".

The Stingrays drew the highest attendance in the league, averaging 8,589 fans per game. The Stingrays returned to the East Division in 1995&ndash;96 and finished third in the regular season, falling in the second round of the playoffs to the Charlotte Checkers.Namm, Keith (1996-04-14).

The Stingrays fell to second place in league attendance with an average 7,447 fans per game. In 1996&ndash;97, the Stingrays won both the ECHL championship Kelly Cup (defeating the Louisiana IceGators four games to one) and the Brabham Cup (awarded to the team with the best regular season record), becoming the first ECHL team and one of three overall to win both a regular season and postseason championship in the same year.Namm, Keith (1997-03-07). "Brabham Cup just first step for Stingrays". Post and Courier. Retrieved 2010-11-04. The Alaska Aces (2006, 2011) and the Cincinnati Cyclones (2008) later accomplished this feat. Forwards Ed Courtenay and Mike Ross tied for the highest total points in the league, each with 110 points in combined goals and assists. Forward Dave Seitz finished seventh with 97 total points. Ross was also named the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP), the only member of the Stingrays to receive this distinction through the 2010&ndash;11 season. Goaltender Jason Fitzsimmons was selected as the Kelly Cup playoffs MVP. Fitzsimmons totaled 13 wins in 17 playoff games and achieved a 3.38 GAA with a 0.903 save percentage. Following their Kelly Cup victory, ECHL management accused the franchise of circumventing the league's salary cap by colluding with the city of North Charleston to funnel money through a city-run youth hockey program to provide payouts to players. After two months of investigation by the league, the Stingrays were assessed a US$50,000 fine, and Vaive was suspended for the first six games of the 1997&ndash;98 season. The Internal Revenue Service determined that no state or federal tax laws were broken, but the incident sparked a re-evaluation by the ECHL of the teams' salary caps.Sapakoff, Gene (1997-09-05). "Stingrays fined $50,000, ECHL executives feel $50,000 fine too lenient". Post and Courier. Retrieved 2010-11-04.

Defenseman Chris Hynnes finished the regular season first in goals (19) and fourth in total points (58) among league defensemen. Goaltender Cory Cadden finished seventh in the league with a 2.85 GAA, a 0.907 save percentage and 30 wins in 45 games. The team finished at the top of the Southeast Division, but fell in a first round playoff series against their new in-state rival, the Pee Dee Pride. The Pride advanced after coming back from a three-goal deficit to win the fifth game of a best of five series in overtime. Vaive reported after the fact that replays indicated that the game-tying goal was invalid but the referee missed the call, resulting in the overtime period and the Stingrays' eventual defeat.Namm, Keith (1998-04-09), "Pride's goal in OT eliminates Stingrays".

After receiving a first-round bye for the playoffs, the Stingrays fell in a second-round 3-game shutout to the Mississippi Sea Wolves. The final game was decided in overtime and ran to 110 minutes and 37 seconds, making it the fifth-longest overtime playoff game in league history as of the 2010&ndash;11 season.

The Stingrays set the league postseason record for most goals by one team in a two-game series with 11 goals in their two-game shutout of the Baton Rouge Kingfish in the preliminary round of the playoffs. The team eliminated in-state rivals Pee Dee Pride three games to two to advance to the second round, where they were shut out in three games by the Louisiana IceGators. The Stingrays finished the 2000&ndash;01 season first in both the Southeast Division and the Southern Conference. Ryan Brindley finished third among league defensemen with an average 10 points per game. The team accrued a season-record 141 penalty minutes in one game against the Greensboro Monarchs on October 13, 2000.
