    Dartmouth College ( ) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Dartmouth consists of a liberal arts college, the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, and the Tuck School of Business, as well as 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences. Incorporated as the "Trustees of Dartmouth College," it is one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. With an undergraduate enrollment of 4,289 and a total student enrollment of 6,298 (as of 2014), Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. It was the last Ivy League school to admit women, in 1972.The Dartmouth Dartmouth College was established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister. After a long period of financial and political struggles, Dartmouth emerged in the early 20th century from relative obscurity. Dartmouth's  campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New Hampshire. Participation in athletics and the school's Greek system is strong. Dartmouth's 34 varsity sports teams compete in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. Students are well known for preserving a variety of strong campus traditions.  Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister from Columbia, Connecticut, who had previously sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks. Wheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755. The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock. The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.  Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued the charter in the name of King George III establishing the College. That charter created a college "for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others." The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth—an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it—Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule. The College granted its first degrees in 1771. Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites. Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.  In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college's royal charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby. Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: "It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it." In 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.http://www.unh.edu/main/brief-history Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded. Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux. 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having "refounded Dartmouth" and bringing it into national prestige. Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s. John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations. During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission. In 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth. Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, previously serving as a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy. At about the same time, the college adopted its "Dartmouth Plan" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities. In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from "Men of Dartmouth" to "Dear old Dartmouth". During the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed. The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.3 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008. The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center. In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance "whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial," citing Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century. Since the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict. President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008 and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009. In May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden). Dartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book Passion for Skiing as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book Passion for Snow. Dartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students. The college boasts 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors. In 2008, the most popular majors were economics, government, history, psychological and brain sciences, English, biology, and engineering sciences. The Government Department, whose prominent professors include Stephen Brooks, Richard Ned Lebow, and William Wohlforth, was ranked the top solely undergraduate political science program in the world by researchers at the London School of Economics in 2003. The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower and Andrew Samwick, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor's-only economics program in the world. In order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program. Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten "distributive requirements" in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing. Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in "independent, sustained work," culminating in the production of a thesis. In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs. Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s. Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)&nbsp;— which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences&nbsp;— and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of "Dartmouth University"; however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward), the school uses the name "Dartmouth College" to refer to the entire institution. Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities. Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Conferences, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million. Dartmouth serves as the host institution of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes Brandeis University, the University of New Hampshire, Northeastern University, Tufts University and the University of Vermont.  Dartmouth was ranked 11th among undergraduate programs at national universities by U.S. News & World Report in its 2015 rankings. Dartmouth's strength in undergraduate education is highlighted by U.S. News when in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 it ranked Dartmouth first in undergraduate teaching at national universities. It has since been ranked 4th in this area in the 2015 rankings and second in the 2016 rankings. The institution also ranked first in High School Counselor Rankings in 2012. The college ranks 7th in The Wall Street Journal's ranking of top feeder schools. In Forbes' alternative rankings of colleges, the ranking considers Dartmouth a liberal arts college, for which it ranks 8th, and 18th overall in its combined liberal arts college and national universities ranking.<ref>{{Cite web|title = America's Top Colleges|url = http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/|accessdate = 2015-06-26}}</ref> It ranks #2 in grateful graduates and received a financial aid grade of A+.

Dartmouth practices need-blind admissions for all applicants who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented students in the U.S. These applicants are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. For international students, financial need is taken into consideration as one of many factors at the time of admission. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $100,000 or less and possessing typical assets. In 2015, $88.8 million in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.  === The Dartmouth Plan === [[File:BakerLibrary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baker Memorial Library]] at Dartmouth College]] Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week [[academic term]]s. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply "D-Plan") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.<ref name="d-plan-admin"/> However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during their freshman, senior, or sophomore summer terms.<ref name="Petition for Change">{{cite web|title=Petition for Change in Enrollment Pattern |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/docs/change_in_enrollment_pattern.pdf |publisher=Dartmouth |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}</ref>  During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.<ref name="d-plan-admin"/> The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.<ref name="Working Rules and Procedures"/>  The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as "a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds."<ref name="trd-wheelock"/> Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.  === Board of Trustees === {{Main|Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College}} [[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Dartmouth Hall 02.JPG|thumb|right|Dartmouth Hall, reconstructed in 1906]] Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the college president (''ex officio''), the [[governor of New Hampshire|state governor]] (''ex officio''), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called "charter trustees"), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board ("alumni trustees").<ref name="Dartmouth Trustees vote to expand size of board"/> The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.

The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named [[Samson Occom]], and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.<ref name="about-nap"/>  The college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years.<ref name= "about-nap"/> In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a "new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment."<ref name = "about-nap" /> Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 1,000 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.<ref name="about-nap" />  === Traditions === {{Main|Dartmouth College traditions}} [[File:2004 Winter Carnival Sculpture.JPG|thumb|upright|Snow sculpture at the 2004 Dartmouth Winter Carnival]]  Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.<ref name="15th President Installed at Dartmouth"/> The college functions on a [[Academic term|quarter system]], and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as "big weekends"<ref name="steph"/><ref name="The Dartmouth Green: A Walking Tour of Dartmouth"/> or "party weekends".<ref name="Hopkins Center offers many alternatives over weekend"/> In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a [[bonfire]] on the Green constructed by the freshman class.<ref name="homecoming-history"/> Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports.<ref name="tdr-wc"/> In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.<ref name="Green Key History: Those Were the Days"/>  The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the [[Connecticut River]]. Begun in 1986, Tubestock met its demise in 2006 when Hanover town ordinances and a lack of coherent student protest conspired to defeat the popular tradition.<ref name="Town, College Weigh Tubestock Changes"/> The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.<ref name="Fieldstock, chariots await town approval"/>  Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the [[Moosilauke Ravine Lodge]].<ref name="About the Program"/> In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.  == Insignia and other representations ==  === Motto and song === Dartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is ''Vox clamantis in deserto''.

The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:  {{quote|An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words "vox clamantis in deserto" the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.<ref name="collections"/>}}  On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.<ref name="good"/> The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from "1770" to "1769", to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of "1769" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.<ref name="good"/> The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.<ref name="uspatent"/>  === Shield === On October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a "Dartmouth College Shield" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another [[coat of arms]] based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer [[Thoreau MacDonald]]. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from "1770" to "1769" around 1958.<ref name="good"/> That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.<ref name="uspatent"/>  College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.<ref name="A Proposal for a Heraldic Coat of Arms for Dartmouth College"/> The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of [[Dartmouth Medical School]], and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.<ref name="Nanometer Pattern Generation System: Dartmouth Seal"/> The design has appeared on [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]'s Bicentennial Medal ([[Philadelphia Mint]], 1969) and elsewhere.  === Nickname, symbol, and mascot ===  Dartmouth has never had an official [[mascot]].<ref name="ad-green"/> The nickname "The Big Green," originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green ("Dartmouth Green") as the school's official color in 1866.<ref name="greencolor"/><ref name="History-of-Dartmouth-Hanover"/> Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname "the Indians", a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.<ref name="ad-green"/> This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the "use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education."<ref name="The 'Big Green' Nickname"/> Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'', have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,<ref name="Dartmouth Indians: The New Tradition"/> but never succeeded in doing so.<ref name="The Banning of the Indian"/>  Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become "official." One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' was [[Keggy the Keg]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,<ref name="Straight from the Tap: the men behind the mascot"/> the mascot has received approval from only the student government.<ref name="thedartmouth4"/> In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the "Dartmoose" as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.<ref name="First SA meeting draws crowd"/>  == Alumni == {{Main|List of Dartmouth College alumni}} Dartmouth's alumni are known for their devotion to the college.<ref name="ihe-alum"/> Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift.
