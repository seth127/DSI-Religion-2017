        Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff (10 March 1788 – 26 November 1857) was a German poet, novelist, playwright, literary critic, translator, and anthologist.http://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Freiherr-von-Eichendorff Eichendorff was one of the major writers and critics of RomanticismCf. J. A. Cuddon: The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms & Literary Theory, revised by C. E. Preston. England 1999, p. 770. Ever since their publication and up to the present day, some of his works have been very popular in Germany.Cf. Peter Horst Neumann: Eichendorff im Technischen Zeitalter. Zu seinem 200. Geburtstag. In: Die Zeit/Zeitmagazin 11. März 1988 http://www.zeit.de/1988/11/eichendorff-im-technischen-zeitalter Eichendorff first became famous for his novella Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts (Memoirs of a Good-For-Nothing)Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff: Memoirs of a Good-For-Nothing. Ungar, New York 1955. ISBN 0804461341 and his poems.Cf. Jürgen Thym: 100 Years Of Eichendorff Songs. Recent Researches in the Music of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries, vol. V; A-R Editions, Inc. Madison 1983, p. viii. ISBN 0-89579-173-0 The Memoirs of a Good-For-Nothing, a typical romantic novella, whose main themes are wanderlust and love. The protagonist, the son of a miller, rejects his father's trade and becomes a gardener at a Viennese palace where he subsequently falls in love with the local duke's daughter. As, with his lowly status, she is unattainable for him, he escapes to Italy - only to return and learn that she is the duke's adopted daughter, and thus within his social reach.http://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Freiherr-von-Eichendorff With its combination of dream world and realism, Memoirs of a Good-For-Nothing is considered to be a high point of Romantic fiction. One critic stated that "Eichendorff’s 'Good-For-Nothing' is the "personification of love of nature and an obsession with hiking."Cf. Ernst Alker: Die Deutsche Literatur im 19. Jahrhundert (1832-1914), 2nd ed., Kröners TB vol.339, Stuttgart 1962, p.27. Thomas Mann called Eichendorff's Good-For-Nothing a combination of "the purity of the folk song and the fairy tale."Hanjo Kesting: Eichendorff und seine Gesellen. Die Wiederkehr der Romantik. http://www.frankfurter-hefte.de/upload/Archiv/2008/Heft_01-02/PDF/080102_86_89.pdf Many of Eichendorff's poems were first published as integral parts of his novellas and stories, where they are often performed in song by one of the protagonists.Cf. Katja Löhr: Sehnsucht als poetologisches Prinzip bei Joseph von Eichendorff. Epistemata, Würzburger Wissenschaftliche Schriften, Reihe Literaturwissenschaft vol.248, Würzburg 2003, p.12-13. ISBN 3-8260-2536-9 The novella Good-For-Nothing alone contains 54 poems.Cf. Wolfdietrich Rasch (Ed.): Joseph von Eichendorff. Sämtliche Gedichte. Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag München, 1975, p.502/503. ISBN 3-446-11427-0 Eichendorff, a descendant of an old noble family, was born in 1788 at Schloß Lubowitz near Ratibor (now Racibórz, Poland) in Upper Silesia, at that time part of the Kingdom of Prussia. His parents were the Prussian officer Adolf Freiherr von Eichendorff (1756-1818) and his wife, Karoline née Freiin von Kloche (1766-1822), who came from an aristocratic Roman Catholic family.Joseph von Eichendorff http://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Freiherr-von-Eichendorff Eichendorff sold the family estates Deutsch-Krawarn, Kauthen, and Wrbkau and acquired Lubowitz Castle from his mother-in-law. The castle's Rococo reconstruction, which was begun by her, was very expensive and almost bankrupted the family.Cf. Günther Schiwy: Eichendorf. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit. Eine Biographie. Verlag C.H. Beck, München 2000, p.30 f. ISBN 3-406-46673-7 Young Joseph was close to his older brother Wilhelm (1786-1849). From 1793-1801 they were home-schooled by tutor Bernhard Heinke. Joseph began writing diaries as early as 1798, witnesses to his budding literary career.Cf. Paul Stöcklein: Joseph von Eichendorff. In Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten. Rowohlts Monographien. Ed. by Kurt Kusenberg, Rowohlt Verlag, Reinbek 1974, pp.47, 163. ISBN 3-499-50084-1 The diaries present many insights into the development of the young writer, ranging from simple statements about the weather to notes about finances to early poems. At a young age, Eichendorff was already well aware of his parents financial straits. On 19 June 1801, the thirteen-year old noted in his diary: "Father travelled to Breslau, on the run from his creditors," adding on 24 June, "mom become terribly faint."Cf. Günther Schiwy: Eichendorf. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit. Eine Biographie. Verlag C.H. Beck, München 2000, pp. 32-33, 97. ISBN 3-406-46673-7 With his brother Wilhelm, Joseph attended the Catholic Matthias Gymnasium in Breslau (1801-1804). While previously preferring chapbooks, he was now introduced to the poetry of Matthias Claudius and Voltaire’s La Henriade, an epic poem about the last part of the wars of religion and Henry IV in ten songs. In 1804 his sister Luise Antonie Nepomucene Johanna was born (died 1883), who was to become a friend of Austrian writer Adalbert Stifter. After their final exams, both brothers attended lectures at the University of Breslau and the Protestant Maria-Magdalena-Gymnasium. Eichendorff's diary from this time shows that he valued formal education much less than the theatre, recording 126 plays and concerts visited. His love for Mozart also goes back to these days.Cf. Günther Schiwy: Eichendorf. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit. Eine Biographie. Verlag C.H. Beck, München 2000, pp.96-97.

ISBN 3-499-50084-1 Together with his brother Wilhelm, Joseph studied law and the humanities in Halle an der Saale (1805–1806), a city near Jena, which was a focal point of the Frühromantik (Early Romantics).Cf. J. A. Cuddon: The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms & Literary Theory, revised by C. E. Preston. England 1999, p. 770. The brothers frequently attended the theatre of Lauchstädt, 13&nbsp;km where the Weimar court theatrical company performed plays by Goethe.Cf. Paul Stöcklein: Joseph von Eichendorff.

To complete their studies, Wilhelm and Joseph went to the University of Heidelberg in 1807, another important centre of Romanticism. Here Eichendorff befriended romantic poet Heinrich Otto von Loeben (1786-1825), met Achim von Arnim (1781-1831) and possibly Clemens Brentano (1778-1842).Cf.

In Berlin they came into closer contact with Romantic writers such as Achim von Arnim, Clemens Brentano, Adam Müller, and Heinrich von Kleist.Cf. Paul Stöcklein: Joseph von Eichendorff.

ISBN 3-406-46673-7 His deep sorrow about the unrequitted love for the nineteen-year-old daughter of a cellarman inspired Eichendorff to one of his most famous poems, Das zerbrochene Ringlein (The Broken Ring).  In his deep desperation over this unhappy infatuation, Eichendorff craved death in military exploits as mentioned in his poem Das zerbrochene Ringlein:  Ich möchte’ als Reiter fliegen                               Wohl in die blut’ge Schlacht,                               Um stille Feuer liegen                               Im Feld bei dunkler Nacht.   I fain would mount a charger                               And glory seek in fight,                               By silent camp-fires lying,                               When falls the dark of night.

Although Chase’s translation weakens the second line from  blut’ge Schlacht (bloody battle) to "in fight" this, actually, happens to be much closer to the historical truth, since Eichendorff’s participation in the Lützow Free Corps seems to be a myth - in spite of some authorities asserting the contary.Cf.

In: Die Welt, 26 November 2007 http://www.welt.de/kultur/article1400183/Eichendorff-der-ewig-spaete-Taugenichts.html   His parents, in order to save the indebted family estate, hoped that Eichendorff would marry a wealthy heiress, however he fell in love with Aloysia von Larisch (1792-1855), called ‚Luise’, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a prominent, yet impoverished Catholic family of nobles. The betrothal took place in 1809, the same year Eichendorff went to Berlin to take up a profession there. In 1815, the couple was married in Breslau's St. Vinzenz church  and that same year Eichendorff’s son Hermann was born, followed in 1819 by their daughter Therese. In 1818, Eichendorff's father died and in 1822 his mother. The death of his mother resulted in the final loss of all the family's estates in Silesia.Cf. Paul Stöcklein: Joseph von Eichendorff.

Both, Eichendorff’s brother Gustav (born 1800) and his sister Louise Antonie (born 1799) died in 1803 at a very young age, as did two of Eichendorff’s daughters between 1822 and 1832.Cf.

Only the winds are wandering                               Around the house and moan,                               And by the window harking                               We sit inside, alone.                                                    Translated by Margarete MünsterbergMargarete Münsterberg (Ed., trans.): A Harvest of German Verse. Berlin 1916.  With his literary figure of the Good-For-Nothing Eichendorff created the paradigm the wanderer. The motif itself had been central to romanticism since Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Ludwig Tieck undertook their famous Pfingstwanderung (Whitsun excursion) in the Fichtelgebirge in 1793, an event that began the Romantic movement.Cf. Günther Schiwy: Eichendorf. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit. München 2000, pp.172. ISBN 3-406-46673-7 Travels through Germany, Austria, and France rounded off Eichendorff’s education, however, he himself was not much of a hiker. Apart from some extensive marches on foot during his school and college days (for example from Halle to Leipzig, in order to see popular actor Iffland),Günther Schiwy: Eichendorf. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit. Munich 2000, p.145. ISBN 3-406-46673-7 he only undertook one lengthy tour, traversing for seventeen days the Harz mountains with his brother in 1805, a trip partly undertaken using the stagecoach, as witnessed by his diary.After Günther Schiwy: Eichendorff. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit. Munich 2000, pp.174-185. ISBN 3-406-46673-7 Eichendorff was less of a romantic wanderer, but rather displaced again and again by changes of location necessitated by his official activities. The following trips, mainly undertaken by coach or boat, are documented: Eichendorff worked in various capacities as Prussian government administrator. His career began in 1816 as unpaid clerk in Breslau. In November 1819, he was appointed assessor and in 1820 consistorial councilor for West and East Prussia in Danzig, with an initial annual salary of 1200 thalers. In April 1824, Eichendorff was relocated to Königsberg as "Oberpräsidialrat" (chief administrator) with an annual salary of 1600 thalers. In 1821, Eichendorff was appointed school inspector and, in 1824, "Oberpräsidialrat" in Königsberg.Cf. Klaus Günzel: Romantikerschicksale. Eine Porträtgalerie. Berlin 1988, p.219. ISBN 3-373-00157-9 In 1831, he moved his family to Berlin, where he worked as Privy Councilor for the Foreign Ministry until his retirement in 1844.  Eichendorff’s brother Wilhelm died in 1849 in Innsbruck. That same year, there was a Republican uprising and the Eichendorff’s fled to Meißen and Köthen, where a little house was purchased for his daughter Therese (now a von Besserer-Dahlfingen) in 1854. In 1855, he was much affected by the death of his wife. In September he traveled to Sedlnitz for the christening of his grandchild. Shortly after he made his very last trip, dying of pneumonia on 26 November 1857 in Neiße. He was buried the next day with his wife.Cf. Günther Schiwy:  Eichendorf. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit.

ISBN 3-406-46673-7    The two writers who had the greatest early influence on Eichendorff's artistic development where Friedrich Schlegel, who established the term romantisch (romantic) in German literature,J. A. Cuddon: The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms & Literary Theory, revised by C. E. Preston. England 1999, p.768. and Joseph Görres. While the writers who gathered around Schlegel inclined more to philosophy and aesthetic theory, the adherents of Görres became mainly known as writers of poetry and stories.J. A. Cuddon: The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms & Literary Theory, revised by C. E. Preston. England 1999, p.770. Both movements, however, greatly influenced intellectual life in Germany by emphasising the individual, the subjective, the irrational, the imaginative, the personal, the spontaneous, the emotional, the visionary, and the transcendental over classical precepts.http://www.britannica.com/art/Romanticism One of their fundamental ideas was the "unity of poetry and life".Cf. Robert König: Deutsche Literaturgeschichte. Bielefeld/Leipzig 1886, p.521. Eichendorff shared Schlegel’s view that the world was a naturally and eternally "self-forming artwork",Quoting after Natias Neutert: Foolnotes. Smith Gallery Booklet, Soho New York 1980, p.7, see Friedrich Schlegel: Gespräch über die Poesie. In: Paul Kluckhohn (Ed.): Kunstanschauung der Frühromantik. Deutsche Literatur, Reihe Romantik. Vol.III, Philipp Reclam jun., Leipzig, 1937, p.191. Eichendorff himself used the metaphor that "nature [was] a great picture book, which the good Lord has pitched for us outside."http://zitate.woxikon.de/autoren/joseph-von-eichendorff Arnim’s and Brentano’s studies and interpretations of the Volkslied (folk song) deeply influenced Eichendorff’s own poetry and poetology.Cf. Hartwig Schulz: Eichendorffs satirische Dramen. In: Michael Kessler/Helmut Koopmann: Eichendorffs Modernität. Akten des internationalen, interdisziplinären Eichendorff-Symposions 6.-8. October 1988, Akademie der Diözese Rottenburg-Stuttgart. Stauffenburg Colloquium, Vol.9., Tübingen 1989, p.146. ISBN 978-3-8260-3951-5  Arnim's and Brentano's anthology Des Knaben Wunderhorn: Alte deutsche Lieder, a collection of songs about love, soldiers, wandering, as well as children's songs, was an important source for the Romantic movement. Similar to other early 19th-century anthologists such as Thomas Percy, Arnim and Brentano edited and rewrote the poems in they collected. "Everything in the world happens because of poetry, to live life with an increased sense and history is the expression of this general poetry of the human race, the fate performs this great spectacle," is what Arnim said in a letter to Brentano (9 July 1802).Cf. Ludwig Achim von Arnim: Briefwechsel 1802–1804. Vol.31, Max Niemeyer Verlag, Tübingen 2004. p.57 Although Eichendorffs poetry includes many metric forms ranging from very simple elegiac couplets and stanzas to sonnets, his main artistic focus was on poems imitating folk songs.Cf. R.G. Bogner: Joseph Eichendorff Gedichte, in: Ralf Georg Bogner (Ed.): Deutsche Literatur auf einen Blick. 400 Werke aus 1200 Jahren. Ein Kanon. Darmstadt 2009, p.205. ISBN 978-3-89678-663-0 A comparison of forms shows that Eichendorff’s lyricism is "directly influenced by Brentano and Arnim".Cf. Horst Joachim Frank: Handbuch der deutschen Strophenformen. 2nd, revised ed., Tübingen/Basel 1993, p.107.Also Cf. Jacob Haxold Heinzelmann: The influence of the German Volkslied on Eichendorff's lyric. https://archive.org/stream/influenceofgerma00hein/influenceofgerma00hein_djvu.txt Following the model of Des Knaben Wunderhorn, Eichendorff uses simple words ('naturalness'), adding more meaning ('artificiality') than dictionary definitions would indicate. In this sense, "His words are rich in connotative power, in imaginative appeal and in sound."Cf. Edward A. Bloom/Charles H. Philbrick/Elmer M. Blistein: The Order of Poetry. Brown University, New York 1961, p.2. Certain expressions and formulas used by Eichendorff, which are sometimes characterised by critics as pure cliché,Cf. Reinhard H. Thum: Cliché and Stereotype. An Examination of the Lyric Landscape in Eichendorff’s Poetry. In: Philological Quarterly no. 62, University of Iowa 1983, pp. 435-457. actually represent a conscious reduction in favour of emblematics. In Görres’ poetology "nature is speaking"Cf.

But before it can happen, the wonderful song sleeping in each thing must be woken up by the poet’s word:Joseph von Eichendorff, cited in Hans Jürg Lüthi: Dichtung und Dichter bei Joseph von Eichendorff, Bern 1966, p.69 One notable example used by Eichendorff is the Zauberwort(magic word) - and one of Eichendorff’s most celebrated poems, the four-line stanza Wünschelrute (divining rod), is about finding such a Zauberwort:    Wünschelrute                               Schläft ein Lied in allen Dingen,                               die da träumen fort und fort                               und die Welt hebt an zu singen,                               triffst du nur das Zauberwort.                                        Wishing Wand                               A song's asleep in everything                               And it dreams on and on,                               And the world begins to sing,                               Once you hit the magic tone.                                                     The titles of Eichendorff’s poems show that, besides the motif of wandering, the two other main motifs of his poetry were the passing of time (transience) and nostalgia. Time, for Eichendorff, is not just a natural phenomenon but, as Marcin Worbs elaborated: "Each day and each of our nights has a metaphysical dimension."Cf. Marcin Worbs: Zur religiösen Aussage der Poesie Joseph von Eichendorffs. In: Grazyna Barabara Szewczyk/Renata Dampc-Jarosz (Ed.): Eichendorff heute lesen, Bielefeld 2009, p.69. ISBN 978-3-89528-744-2 The morning, on the other hand, evokes the impression that "all nature had been created just in this very moment,"Cf. Peter Paul Schwarz: Aurora. Zur romantischen Zeitstruktur bei Eichendorff. Ars poetica. Texte zur Dichtungslehre und Dichtkunst. Vol. 12, ed. by August Buck et al., Bad Homburg 1970, p.60.Cf. Marshall Brown: Eichendorff’s Time of day. In: «The German Quarterly», No.50, 1977, pp.485-503. while the evening often acts as a mysterium mortis with the persona poderiung on transience and death. Eichendorff's other main motif, nostalgia, is described by some critic as a phenomenon of infinity.Cf. Sybille Anneliese Margot Reichert: Unendliche Sehnsucht . The concept of Longing in German romantic Narrative and Song. Dissertation Yale University, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1994. However, there is a number of different interpretations. Accoring to Helmut Illbruck: The "simple-minded Taugenichts (...) feels continually homesick and can never come to rest."Cf. Helmut Illbruck: Nostalgia. Origins and Ends of an Unenlightened Disease, Evanston Illinois, p.153. ISBN 9780810128378. Katja Löhr distinguishes between nostalgia as an emotion consisting of two components — longing and melancholy: "The inner emotion of longing is to long for, the inner emotion of melancholy is to mourn. As an expression of deep reflection, longing corresponds with intuition (Ahnen), grieving with memory." Theodor W. Adorno, who set out to rescue Eichendorff from his misled conservative admirers, attested: "He was not a poet of the homeland, but rather a poet of homesickness".Cf. Theodor. W. Adorno: Zum Gedächtnis Eichendorffs. In: Noten zur Literatur I, Frankfurt am Main, 1963, p.112. In sharp contrast, Natias Neutert saw in Eichendorff’s nostalgia a dialectical unity of an "unstable equilibrium of homesickness and wanderlust at once".Cf. Natias Neutert: Foolnotes, Soho, New York 1980, p.7. For a long time it had been argued that Eichendorff's view of Romanticism had been subordinate to religious beliefs. More recently, however, Christoph Hollender has pointed that Eichendorff's late religious and political writings were commissioned works, while his poetry represents a highly personal perspective.Cf. Christoph Hollender: Der Diskurs von Poesie und Religion in der Eichendorff-Literatur. In: Wilhelm Gössmann (Ed.): Joseph von Eichendorff. Seine literarische und kulturelle Bedeutung. Paderborn/Munich/Wien/Zurich 1995, p.163-232.  Eichendorff summed up the Romantic epoch stating that it "soared like a magnificent rocket sparkling up into the sky, and after shortly and wonderfully lighting up the night, it exploded overhead into a thousand colorful stars."Quoted after Robert König: Deutsche Literaturgeschichte. 18th edition. Verlag Velhagen & Klasing, Bielefeld/Leipzig 1886, p.521. "While other authors (such as Ludwig Tieck, Caroline de la Motte Fouqué, Clemens Brentano and Bettina von Arnim) adapted the themes and styles of their writing to the emerging realism, Eichendorff  "stayed true to the emblematic universe of his literary Romanticism right through to the 1850s," Cf.
