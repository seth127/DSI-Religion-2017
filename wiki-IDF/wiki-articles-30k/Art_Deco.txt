    Art Deco  (), or Deco, is an influential visual arts design style that first appeared in France just before World War I  and began flourishing internationally in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s before its popularity waned after World War II.  It took its name, short for Arts Décoratifs,  from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It is an eclectic style that combines traditional craft motifs with Machine Age imagery and materials. The style is often characterized by rich colours, bold geometric shapes and lavish ornamentation. Deco emerged from the interwar period when rapid industrialisation was transforming culture. One of its major attributes is an embrace of technology. This distinguishes Deco from the organic motifs favoured by its predecessor Art Nouveau. Historian Bevis Hillier defined Art Deco as "an assertively modern style [that] ran to symmetry rather than asymmetry, and to the rectilinear rather than the curvilinear; it responded to the demands of the machine and of new material [and] the requirements of mass production". During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance and faith in social and technological progress. The first use of the term Art Deco is sometimes attributed to architect Le Corbusier, who penned a series of articles in his journal L'Esprit nouveau under the headline "1925 Expo: Arts Déco". He was referring to the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts). The term came into more general use in 1966, when a French exhibition celebrating the 1925 event was held under the title Les Années 25: Art Déco/Bauhaus/Stijl/Esprit Nouveau. Here the term was used to distinguish the new styles of French decorative crafts that had emerged since the Belle Epoque. The term Art Deco has since been applied to a wide variety of works produced during the Interwar period (L'Entre Deux Guerres), and even to those of the Bauhaus in Germany. However, Art Deco originated in France. It has been argued that the term should be applied to French works and those produced in countries directly influenced by France. Art Deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian Bevis Hillier published the first book on the subject: Art Deco of the 20s and 30s. Hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites The Times (2 November 1966) and an essay named "Les Arts Déco" in Elle magazine (November 1967) as examples of prior usage. In 1971, Hillier organised an exhibition at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, which he details in his book about it, The World of Art Deco.  Some historians trace Deco's roots to the Universal Exposition of 1900. After this show a group of artists established an informal collective known as La Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of Decorative Artists) to promote French crafts. Among them were Hector Guimard, Eugène Grasset, Raoul Lachenal, Paul Bellot, Maurice Dufrêne and Emile Decoeur. These artists are said to have influenced the principles of Art Deco. The Art Deco era is often anecdotally dated from 1925 when the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes was organized to showcase new ideas in applied arts, although the style had been in full force in France for several years before that date. Deco was heavily influenced by pre-modern art from around the world and observable at the Musée du Louvre, Musée de l'Homme and the Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie. During the 1920s, affordable travel permitted in situ exposure to other cultures. There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at Pompeii, Troy, the tomb of Tutankhamun, etc. Artists and designers integrated motifs from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, Asia, Mesoamerica and Oceania with Machine Age elements. Deco was also influenced by Cubism, Constructivism, Functionalism, Modernism, and Futurism. In 1905, before the onset of Cubism, Eugène Grasset wrote and published Méthode de Composition Ornementale, Éléments Rectilignes, within which he systematically explored the decorative (ornamental) aspects of geometric elements, forms, motifs and their variations, in contrast with (and as a departure from) the undulating Art Nouveau style of Hector Guimard, so popular in Paris a few years earlier. Grasset stresses the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements. At the 1907 Salon d'Automne in Paris, Georges Braque exhibited Viaduc à l'Estaque (a proto-Cubist work), now at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Simultaneously, there was a retrospective exhibition of 56 works by Paul Cézanne, as a tribute to the artist who died in 1906. Cézanne was interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder, the sphere, the cone. Paul Iribe created for the couturier Paul Poiret esthetic designs that shocked the Parisian milieu with its novelty. These illustrations were compiled into an album, Les Robes de Paul Poiret racontée par Paul Iribe, published in 1908.Les Robes de Paul Poiret racontée par Paul Iribe, P. Poiret, 1908, Paris At the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay, shown together in Room 18, elaborated upon Cézannian syntax, revealing to the general public for the first time a "mobile perspective" in their art, soon to become known as Cubism. Several months later, the Salon d'Automne saw the invitation of Munich artists who for several years had been working with simple geometric shapes. Leading up to 1910 and culminating in 1912, the French designers André Mare and Louis Sue turned towards the quasi-mystical Golden ratio, in accord with Pythagorean and Platonic traditions, giving their works a Cubist sensibility. The artists of the Section d'Or exhibited (in 1912) works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion, furniture and interior designers.La Section d'or, 1912-1920-1925, Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000 These revolutionary changes occurring at the outset of the 20th century are summarized in the 1912 writings of André Vera. Le Nouveau style, published in the journal L'Art décoratif, expressed the rejection of Art Nouveau forms (asymmetric, polychrome and picturesque) and called for simplicité volontaire, symétrie manifeste, l'ordre et l'harmonie, themes that would eventually become ubiquitous within the context of Art Deco.André Vera, Le Nouveau style, published in L'Art décoratif, January 1912, pp. 21–32 packed" height="350px Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, by Auguste Perret, 15 Avenue Montaigne, Paris (1910–1913) The Majorelle Building, Paris by Henri Sauvage (1912–1914) The Studio Building, Paris, by Henri Sauvage (1926) La Samaritaine department store, by Henri Sauvage, Paris (1925–1928) The Grand Rex movie palace in Paris (1932) Grand dining room of the ocean liner SS Normandie (1935), with Lalique glass ceiling. Auditorium and stage of Radio City Music Hall, New York City (1932) Between 1910 and 1913, Paris saw the construction of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, 15 avenue Montaigne, another sign of the radical aesthetic change experienced by the Parisian milieu of the time. The rigorous composition of its facade, designed by Auguste Perret, is a major example of early Art Deco.Théâtre des Champs-Élysées Review Fodor's Travel GuidePeter Collins, Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture, New York: Horizon Press, 1959 The building includes exterior bas reliefs by Antoine Bourdelle, a dome by Maurice Denis, paintings by Édouard Vuillard and Jacqueline Marval, and a stage curtain design by Ker-Xavier Roussel.  It took its inspiration from classical architecture, and featured straight lines,  geometric forms, and decoration in the form of sculptured plaques attached to the exterior. Another important figure of early French art deco architecture was Henri Sauvage, who switched from art nouveau to art deco in designing the Majorelle building in Paris for furniture designer Louis Majorelle  (1912–1914); the studio building in 1926–28;  the Gambetta Palace movie theater in 1920, and a new facade for the La Samaritaine department store (1925–28).  By the 1930s the style had become much more flamboyant, and added much more decoration on the facade.  It was particularly popular for movie theaters, such as the Grand Rex in Paris (1932), and Radio City Music Hall in New York City; and in the decoration of skyscrapers. The art deco style was not limited to buildings on land;  the ocean liner SS Normandie, whose first voyage was in 1935, featured art deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration was made of glass by Lalique.  In the Art Décoratif section of the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as La Maison Cubiste (The Cubist House). The facade was designed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and the interior by André Mare along with a group of collaborators. "Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger de La Fresnaye".Christopher Green, Art in France: 1900–1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000 La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Marie Laurencin and Fernand Léger were hung—and a bedroom. It was an early example of L'art décoratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade.La Maison Cubiste, 1912 This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston,Kubistische werken op de Armory Show listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled "Facade architectural, plaster" (Façade architecturale).Duchamp-Villon's Façade architecturale, 1913"Catalogue of international exhibition of modern art: at the Armory of the Sixty-ninth Infantry, 1913, Duchamp-Villon, Raymond, Facade Architectural Several years after World War I, in 1927, Cubists Joseph Csaky, Jacques Lipchitz, Louis Marcoussis, Henri Laurens, the sculptor Gustave Miklos, and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, Neuilly-sur-Seine, designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer Jacques Doucet, also a collector of Post-Impressionist and Cubist paintings (including Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which he bought directly from Picasso's studio). Laurens designed the fountain, Csaky designed Doucet's staircase, Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel, and Marcoussis made a Cubist rug. Deco emphasizes geometric forms: spheres, polygons, rectangles, trapezoids, zigzags, [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]], and [[sunburst]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]. Elements are often arranged in [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] patterns. Modern materials, such as [[Aluminium|aluminum]], [[stainless steel]], [[Bakelite]], [[Chrome plating|chrome]], and plastics, are frequently used. [[Stained glass]], [[inlay]]s, and [[lacquer]] are also common.

Jerusalemer Str., [[Berlin]]]]  In Germany two variations of Art Deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: The [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neue Sachlichkeit]] (New Objectivity) employed the same curving horizontal lines and nautical motifs that are known as [[Streamline Moderne]] in the Anglophone world. While Neue Sachlichkeit was rather austere and reduced (eventually merging with the [[Bauhaus]] style), [[Expressionist architecture]] came up with a more emotional use of shapes, colors and textures, partly reinterpreting shapes from the German and Baltic [[Brick Gothic]] style. Notable examples are [[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s ''[[Mossehaus]]'' and ''[[Schaubühne]]'' theater in [[Berlin]], [[Fritz Höger]]'s ''[[Chilehaus]]'' in [[Hamburg]] and his ''[[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]]'' in Berlin, the ''Anzeiger Tower'' in [[Hannover]] and the ''Borsig Tower'' in Berlin. Art deco architecture was revived in the late-20th century by architects like [[Hans Kollhoff]] (see his tower on [[Potsdamer Platz]]), Jan Kleihues and Tobias Nöfer.  The 1921 [[Mossehaus]] in [[Berlin]] by [[Erich Mendelsohn]] was a pioneering design in Art Deco and Streamline Moderne, that displays how the Deco style spread and evolved in Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Kathleen|title=Erich Mendelsohn and the Architecture of German Modernism|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521571685}}</ref>  ====Greece==== Art Deco in [[Athens]] incorporated insolently many of the structural and formal characteristics of the Classical idiom, at times transforming them to mere decorative elements, or oppositely, imprinting to them a functionality. Thematically it moved beyond the Classical period and looked for its models in the [[Mycenaean art|Mycenaean]], [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]], [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] arts. The classicizing trends however, as one would expect in the city of [[Parthenon]], held strongly, and despite what it has been sometimes suggested, Art Deco was never really independent in Athens. Rather, it accommodated itself in the midst of a strong and ideologically charged classicizing tradition and produced some of the most original and less expected works of the Greek architectural heritage.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/481398/Art_Deco_in_Athens_modernizing_the_Classical= Sideris A., "Art Deco in Athens: Modernizing the Classical"], ''Studia Hercynia'' 13, 2009, pp. 76-91.</ref>  ====Lithuania==== Like Romania, [[Lithuania]] too experienced booming industrial growth during the [[Interwar period]]. This resulted in the rapid modernization of the city of [[Kaunas]] in particular. At this time it became the temporary capital of Lithuania. [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]], built in 1936 and located in downtown Kaunas, along with the Central Post Building and the Pienocentras HQ Building (1934) are the three most prominent Art Deco structures in the city. Today many of these buildings still stand, and apartment complexes and large government buildings alike survive from this time, even through the [[Nazi]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet occupations]] of Kaunas. Many other buildings around the city were built in the [[Bauhaus]] style.  ====Norway==== An example of Art Deco in Norway is found in the [[Student Society in Trondheim]] (built 1927–29). Its interior is based on an abandoned circus, so that the exterior exhibits a characteristic round shape.  ====Romania==== As a result of the inter-war period of rapid development, cities in Romania have numerous Art Deco buildings, including government buildings, hotels, and private houses. The best representative in this regard is the capital, [[Bucharest]], which, despite the widespread destruction of its architecture during [[Communism in Romania#Heavy industrialisation|Communist times]], still has many Art Deco examples, both on its main boulevards and in the lesser known parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rezistenta.net/2010/08/perspective-21-art-deco-bucurestean.html |title=Bucharest Art Deco |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100823224530/http://www.rezistenta.net/2010/08/perspective-21-art-deco-bucurestean.html|archivedate= 23 August 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/05/arhitectura-interbelica-modernista-in.html |title=Inter-war modernist architecture |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/03/bijuterii-art-deco-in-bucuresti.html |title=Art Deco jewels in Bucharest  |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>  [[Constanta]] has the second number of Art Deco buildings after Bucharest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://constantaoldcity.blogspot.ro/search/label/art-deco |title=Constanta Art Deco}}</ref> [[Ploieşti]] also has many Art Deco houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republicaploiesti.net/2010/08/art-deco-ploiestean-i.html |title=Art Deco in Ploiesti |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100821165705/http://www.republicaploiesti.net/2010/08/art-deco-ploiestean-i.html|archivedate= 21 August 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref>  ====Spain==== [[Valencia]] was built profusely in Art Deco style during the period of economic bounty between wars in which Spain remained neutral. Particularly remarkable are the famous bath house Las Arenas, the building hosting the rectorship of the [[University of Valencia]] and the cinemas Rialto (currently the Filmoteca de la [[Generalitat Valenciana]]), Capitol (reconverted into an office building) and Naruto.  ====United Kingdom==== [[File:Express Building Manchester.jpg|thumb|right|Former [[Daily Express Building, Manchester|Express Building]] (1939) in Manchester, designed by Sir [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]]]]  During the 1930s, Art Deco had a noticeable effect on house design in the United Kingdom,<ref name="Art Deco Style" /> as well as the design of various public buildings.<ref name="Design Handbook" /> Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.<ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm|title=Art Deco Buildings|year=2007|publisher=london-footprints.co.uk|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081211074839/http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm|archivedate= 11 December 2008 |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php|title=Art Deco in Frinton on sea|year=2006|publisher=Art Deco Classics|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20081201132519/http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php|archivedate= 1 December 2008 |deadurl= no}}</ref>  *The [[London Underground]] is famous for many examples of Art Deco architecture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00npm4g/Art_Deco_Icons_London_Transport |title=Four Programmes – Art Deco Icons |publisher=BBC  |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> and there are a number of buildings in the style situated along the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]] in Brentford. Also in West London is the [[Hoover Building]], which was originally built for [[The Hoover Company]] and was converted into a superstore in the early 1990s. *The former [[Arsenal Stadium]] has the famous East Stand facade. It remains at the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal football club]]'s old home at [[Highbury]], [[London Borough of Islington]], which was vacated in the summer of 2006. Opened in October 1936, the structure now has [[Listed building|Grade II listed status]] and has been converted into [[Highbury Square|apartments]]. William Bennie, the organizer of the project, famously used the Art Deco style in the final design which was considered one of the most opulent and impressive stands of world football. *[[Du Cane Court]], in Balham, south-west London, is a good example of the Art Deco style. It was thought to be possibly the largest block of privately owned apartments under one roof in Britain at the time it was built, and the first to employ pre-stressed concrete. It has a grand reception area and is surrounded by Japanese-style gardens; and it has had many famous residents, especially from the performing arts. Elsewhere in south-west London, is [[Battersea Power Station]], which has appeared in films and artwork including the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''. Partially built in the 1930s, the building retains its powerful Art Deco facade. In the middle of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] is the Sunlight Laundry, one of the few surviving Art Deco buildings which is still owned by the commissioning firm and still used for its original purpose. *In [[North East England]], the [[Wills Building]], an old cigarette factory, is a fine Art Deco building built in the late 1940s in Newcastle upon Tyne. *In [[North West England]], the [[Midland Hotel, Morecambe]] is considered one of the finest surviving examples from this period, with sculptures by artist [[Eric Gill]]. The buildings and structures related to the [[Queensway Tunnel]] which connects [[Liverpool]] and [[Birkenhead]] are also distinctly Art Deco. Other notable Art Deco buildings in Liverpool include [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool|Philharmonic Hall]] and the former terminal building at Liverpool Airport—now the [[Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hotel|Crowne Plaza LJLA]]. See [[:Category:Art Deco architecture in Liverpool|Art Deco architecture in Liverpool]]. * In [[Yorkshire]], Leeds Central Station and the adjoining Queens Hotel are both major examples of Art Deco buildings which have been preserved for 21st century usage. *The [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] in Norwich is a fine example of the Art Deco style. It has a 206&nbsp;ft clock tower and the balcony is the longest in the UK at 365&nbsp;ft long.  ===North America===  ====Canada==== In Canada Art Deco structures that survive are mainly in urban centres like [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Vancouver]]. They range from public buildings like [[Vancouver City Hall]] to commercial buildings ([[College Park (Toronto)|College Park]]) to public works ([[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant]]).  *Hamilton boasts a large collection of Art Deco buildings as well. [[Hamilton GO Centre]] is the only example of Art Deco railway station architecture in Canada. Other buildings include: The [[Pigott Building]], an 18-storey condominium (1929), The Sunlife Building, The Bell Telephone Baker Exchange (first telephone exchange in the [[British Empire]], 1929), [[Dominion Public Building]] refurbished into the John Sopinka Courthouse (1936), and [[Hamilton Port Authority#Hamilton Port Authority Building|The Hamilton Port Authority]] (1953). *In Montréal, the Salle Ernest Cormier at Université de Montréal is considered an example of the Art Deco style. *Toronto hosts the vast majority of Art Deco buildings built and surviving: [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] (1931), [[Automotive Building]] (1929), [[Princes' Gates]] (1927), [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (1933 east wing), [[Exhibition Place]] Bandshell, [[Tip Top Tailors Building]] (1929), [[Toronto East General Hospital]] (1929), [[Toronto Coach Terminal]] (1931), [[Metro Theatre (Toronto)]] (1938), [[Canada Permanent Trust Building]] (1930), [[Hart House Theatre]] (1919), [[Bloor Collegiate Institute]] (1920), [[Arcadian Court]] (1929), [[Balfour Building]] (1930)  ====Mexico==== *In [[Mexico City]], art deco residential buildings abound in the chic [[Condesa]] neighborhood, many designed by [[Francisco J. Serrano]]. The interior of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] is a fine example. Another is the [[Edificio El Moro]]  which has the [[Loteria Nacional]] nowadays. It was also the biggest building of Mexico City at the time it was completed.  ====United States==== [[File:Buffalo City Hall, Buffalo, NY - IMG 3740.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Buffalo City Hall]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, Dietel, Wade & Jones, 1931.]] [[File:Bullocks Wilshire.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Bullocks Wilshire]], Los Angeles, [[John and Donald Parkinson]], 1929]] [[File:Cochise County Courthouse Bisbee Arizona ArtDecoDoors.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cochise County Courthouse doors, [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]], Arizona, 1931.

Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York have many Art Deco buildings. The famous skyscrapers are the best-known, but notable Art Deco buildings can be found in various neighborhoods. Art deco was popular during the later years of the [[movie palace]] era of theatre construction.  Excellent examples of Art Deco theatres still exist throughout the United States, such as the [[Fargo Theatre]] in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], and [[The Campus Theatre]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]].  *In 2005, work began on the conversion of the former [[Jersey City Medical Center]] in [[Beacon, Jersey City]], now a national historic site, to a residential enclave. The development is situated on {{convert|14|acre|ha}} and hosts the largest collection of Art Deco buildings in [[New Jersey]].  *In [[Beaumont, Texas]], the [[First National Bank Building (Beaumont, Texas)|First National Bank Building]], [[Jefferson County Courthouse (Texas)|Jefferson County Courthouse]], and [[Kyle Building]] are some of the few Art Deco buildings still in the city. *The [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal|Cincinnati Union Terminal]] occupies an Art Deco-style passenger railroad station that began operation in 1933. Its [[semi-dome]] is the largest in the [[western hemisphere]], measuring {{convert|180|ft}} wide and {{convert|106|ft}} high.<ref>[http://www.cincymuseum.org/information_center/press_room/fact_sheets/ut_architecture.asp Cincinnati Union Terminal Architectural Information Sheet].

Fair Park was built for the 1936 [[World's Fair]], also known as the [[Texas Centennial Exposition]], celebrating the 100th anniversary of the [[Republic of Texas]]. The park is 277 acres and is the last surviving pre-1950 [[World's Fair]] site. Fair Park hosts the annual [[State Fair of Texas]], the largest state fair in the United States. *[[Detroit]]'s many examples of Art Deco architecture include the [[Fisher Building]], [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]], and [[Guardian Building]], all of which are now [[National Historic Landmark]]s, as well as the [[David Stott Building|David Stott]] and [[Penobscot Building]]s. *[[Flint, Michigan]] is home to [[The Paterson Building]] which has extensive Art Deco features throughout the interior and exterior. *The [[Hoover Dam]] features Art Deco motifs throughout, including its concrete water intake towers and brass elevator doors. *[[Houston]]'s Deco survivors include the [[Houston City Hall]], the [[JPMorgan Chase Building (Houston, Texas)|JPMorgan Chase Building]], [[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]], and the [[1940 Air Terminal Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstondeco.org |title=Houston Deco |publisher=Houston Deco |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> *[[Kansas City, Missouri]] is home to the [[Kansas City Power and Light Building]], completed in 1931. This building is a good example of the [[Great Depression]]'s effect on Art Deco construction. Original plans were for a twin tower to go next to it on its west side. However, it was never built due to financial constraints. As a result, the {{convert|476|ft|m|adj=on}} tower has a bare west side with no windows. Other examples of Deco in Kansas City include the [[909 Walnut]], the [[Jackson County Courthouse (Kansas City, Missouri)|Jackson County Courthouse]], [[Kansas City City Hall]], and the [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]]. * The recently opened [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts|Smith Center]] in [[Downtown Las Vegas]] incorporates many design elements from Hoover Dam and, therefore, is a contemporary example of the use of Art Deco style. * Los Angeles' Art Deco architecture is particularly found along [[Wilshire Boulevard]], a main thoroughfare that experienced a period of intense construction activity during the 1920s. Notable examples include the [[Bullocks Wilshire]] building and the [[Pellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre]], built in 1929 and 1931 respectively.

Although a few Art Deco buildings were replaced with contemporary structures during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, most of the centre remained intact long enough to become recognized as architecturally unique, and from the 1990s onwards had been protected and restored.
