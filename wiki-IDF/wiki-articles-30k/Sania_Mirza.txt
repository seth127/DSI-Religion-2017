Mirza  is an offensive baseliner with very powerful groundstroke and is known for setting up good attacks with the sheer velocity of her groundstrokes. Her main strength is her forehand, as well as her good volleying skills. Her power game has drawn comparisons to Romanian legend Ilie Năstase. She is also a great returner of serve finding many return winners during matches. Mirza goes for winners which means she goes for lots of angles. Mirza has said that "There's no doubt that my forehand and backhand can match anyone, it's about the place that they're put in. I can hit the ball as hard as anyone can". "I'm not that fast on my feet", she added as her most evident weakness is her movement around the court, where Mirza usually struggles moving up and around the court. Mirza's second serve and relatively poor mobility are often quoted as her big weaknesses. But by 2012, a series of injuries had effectively ended her singles career. In 2004, Mirza was awarded the Arjuna award by the Indian Government. In 2006, Mirza was awarded a Padma Shri, India's fourth highest honour for her achievements as a tennis player. In the year 2014, the government of Telangana appointed Sania Mirza as the brand ambassador of the state.  Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao congratulated Sania Mirza on her being awarded Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award  In 2009, Sania Mirza became engaged to childhood friend Sohrab Mirza, a millionaire businessman. However the wedding was called off shortly after. On 12 April 2010, she married Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik in a traditional Muslim wedding ceremony at the Taj Krishna Hotel in Hyderabad, India followed by Pakistani wedding customs for a mahr of  6.1&nbsp;million (US$137,500). Their Walima ceremony was held in Lahore, Pakistan.  The online attention the wedding received made Mirza the most searched woman tennis player and Indian sportsperson in 2010, according to Google Trends. The wedding was even more controversial because Malik was accused by another girl of already being married to her and hence he could not marry Mirza without first divorcing her. Initially for many days, Malik refused to grant the divorce claiming he was never married and as this resulted in media attention, he finally divorced the girl. Currently, Mirza is the brand ambassador for the Indian state of Telangana. Sania has established a tennis academy in Hyderabad. Former world no. 1s and multilple Grand Slam winners Cara Black and Martina Navratilova have both visited the academy on different occasions. Sania Mirza was announced as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia. She is the first South Asian Woman to be appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador in the organization's history. The tennis clothes she wears on the court have drawn criticism from some Muslim religious groups.Amelia Gentleman (5 February 2006) India's most wanted Guardian. Retrieved on 30 September 2009. According to one report published 8 September 2005, a Muslim scholar had issued a ruling, saying that her skirts and T-shirts were "un-Islamic" and "corrupting". Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind rejected rumours about disrupting her game saying that they do not stop anyone from playing, although they found female tennis players' dress code objectionable. Nevertheless, Calcutta police tightened security measures to protect her. A leading cleric issued a religious order demanding that Mirza stop wearing indecent clothes to play tennis. The board ruled that  she should wear long tunics and headscarves instead of standard-issue T-shirts and skirts. Mizra told the New York times in 2013 "I remember having a thousand people for security. I couldn't leave the hotel room without informing about five different people. And even when I did, I had a car in front of me and I had a car behind me. I had a guy sitting with me." Nothing happened in Kolkata, but that was far from the last time that Mirza would be at the center of a media firestorm. After Mirza spoke at a conference on safe sex in November 2005, some groups said she was a "corrupting influence on the youth." Mirza clarified her stance by saying that she was opposed to pre-marital sex. In 2006, some newspapers reported that Mirza declined to play doubles with Israeli tennis player Shahar Pe'er for fear of protests from India's Muslim community. However, she teamed up with Pe'er for the 2007 WTA Tour of Stanford, California. Sania Mirza, along with Sunitha Rao were photographed violating the dress code at Beijing Olympic Opening Ceremony parade in 2008. On 4 February 2008, Mirza said that she would stop appearing in tennis tournaments held in India, starting with the 2008 Bangalore Open the following month, citing the series of controversies and upon advice by her manager. But Mirza chose to participate at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. After both Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna refused to play in the men's doubles event at the 2012 Olympics with Leander Paes, Paes demanded that he be partnered with Mirza for the mixed doubles event. Mirza accused the All India Tennis Association (AITA) of using her as 'bait' to keep Paes happy as she wanted to play with Bhupathi, with whom she has won 2 grand slams. In the end, Mirza was paired with Paes and the pair lost in the quarterfinals of the mixed doubles. Mirza was photographed without the Indian flag at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. In response, Mirza reaffirmed her loyalty to the land of her birth – "To see the national flag go up while standing on the podium is the proudest moment in an athlete's life and I will want to experience that for myself in London." Mirza was referred to as "Pakistan's daughter-in-law" and unfit to be a representative of an Indian state after she was appointed the Telangana state's brand ambassador. The comment referred to Mirza's husband, Shoaib Malik being a Pakistani cricketer. Telangana chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao presented Mirza with INR 1 crore on two separate occasions while badminton player Saina Nehwal complained that she did not receive the prize money promised to her for winning the Olympics bronze medal. However, the issue was immediately addressed by the government of Telangana.
