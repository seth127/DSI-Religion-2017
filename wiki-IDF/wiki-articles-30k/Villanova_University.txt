   Villanova University is a private university located in Radnor Township, a suburb northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in the United States. Named after Saint Thomas of Villanova, the school is the oldest Catholic university in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Founded in 1842 by the Order of Saint Augustine, the university traces its roots to old Saint Augustine's Church, Philadelphia, which the Augustinian friars founded in 1796, and to its parish school, Saint Augustine's Academy, which was established in 1811. U.S. News & World Report lists Villanova as a "more selective" regional university and ranks it as the best regional university in the North. Barrons lists Villanova as most selective.  In October 1841, two Augustinian friars from Saint Augustine's Church in Philadelphia purchased the  "Belle Air" estate in Radnor Township with the intention of starting a school. The school, which was called the "Augustinian College of Vilanova", opened in 1842. However, the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844 that burned Saint Augustine's Church in Philadelphia caused financial difficulties for the Augustinians, and the college was closed in February 1845. The college reopened in 1846 and graduated its first class in 1847. In March 1848, the governor of Pennsylvania incorporated the school and gave it the power to grant degrees.  In 1859, the first master's degree was conferred on a student.Address by Dean of the Graduate School Gerald Long to incoming graduate students. August 24, 2008. In 1857, the school closed again as the demand for priests in Philadelphia prevented adequate staffing, and the crisis of the Panic of 1857 strained the school financially. The school remained closed throughout the Civil War and reopened in September 1865; since then it has operated continuously. Its prep department later moved to the Malvern, a town along the Main Line, and is still run by the order. The first great expansion of Villanova began in the late 1890s. Desiring an institution that would "rank among the best in the United States", the college built more classrooms, dormitories, and recreational facilities, and bought instructional equipment.  The School of Technology was established in 1905. In 1915, a two-year pre-medical program was established to help students meet medical schools' new requirements. This led to a four-year pre-medical program, the B.S. in biology, and the founding of the sciences division in 1926. Villanova was all-male until 1918, when the college began evening classes to educate nuns to teach in parochial schools. In 1938, a laywoman received a Villanova degree for the first time. It was not until the nursing school opened in 1953 that women permanently began attending Villanova full-time. In 1958, the College of Engineering admitted its first female student; other colleges admitted women only as commuters. Villanova University became fully coeducational in 1968. During World War II, Villanova was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. After World War II, Villanova expanded, returning veterans swelling enrollments and the faculty growing fourfold. Additional facilities were built, and in 1953, the College of Nursing and the School of Law were established. Villanova achieved university status on November 18, 1953. Between 1954 and 1963, 10 new buildings were built or bought on land adjacent to the campus, including Bartley, Mendel, and Dougherty Halls. During the 1970s and 1980s, Villanova worked to become a nationally recognized university. The quality of faculty and students improved dramatically and international studies programs were introduced. Additional residential and recreational facilities were constructed, and efforts to increase the endowment were undertaken. In the 1980s, endowed chairs were established in theology, philosophy, engineering, and business; scholarship funding was increased, and the curriculum expanded and improved. An extensive building campaign created facilities for the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Commerce, and Finance, as well as student residences on the south and the west campuses.  In 1985, the school also won the Men's NCAA basketball tournament, giving the school increased national exposure. Over the history of the university, it has also served as a headquarters of the Order of Saint Augustine in North America, and has provided staff to establish Catholic high schools throughout the United States, such as St. Augustine High School in San Diego, which was established in 1922 with teaching staff dispatched from Villanova.  Villanova University sits on  just  from Center City Philadelphia.  The campus has roughly 1,500 trees, including the only known instance of a naturally growing sequoia east of the Mississippi River. The campus was formerly known as Arboretum Villanova, but its status as an official arboretum was revoked after the university failed to meet rules and standards such as planting enough new trees and offering tours. There are three named areas on the campus, all within easy walking distance:  The most prominent campus feature is St. Thomas of Villanova Church, whose dual spires are the university's tallest structure. The cornerstone was laid in 1883, and construction ended in 1887.  Built in the Gothic Revival style, the church was renovated in 1943 and 1992.  The church lies at the head of the path crossing Lancaster Avenue into the parking lots and toward South Campus. It is a popular meeting place for students, and hosts three student-oriented masses on Sunday nights at 5:30, 7, and 9&nbsp;p.m.  The church is home to St. Thomas of Villanova Parish, whose Masses take place Sunday morning.  The stained-glass windows of the church depict the life of St. Augustine of Hippo.  Behind the Church is Mendel Field, around which sit six major campus buildings: Slightly east of Mendel Field sits the Grotto, a landscaped haven between Falvey Library and two residence halls: Alumni Hall, home to the Service Learning Community; and Corr Hall, the location of the Center for Peace and Justice Studies and a small residence hall.  Often home to outdoor masses and other large gatherings, the Grotto used to include a statue depicting Our Lady of Good Counsel and plaques dedicated to the veterans of World War II and the Vietnam War, but these were moved to a new location between St. Rita's Hall and Austin Hall, two residence halls across from Alumni Hall that also house the Campus Ministry Office and University Admissions Office, respectively, during the 2012-2013 academic year. Falvey Library, the campus's main research library, houses over 1,000,000 books, thousands of periodicals, television production studios, and quiet places for solitary or group study, as well as the campus's writing center and Math Learning Resource Center, which moved from "Old Falvey" to the renovated second floor of the library during the 2012-2013 academic year. Behind Falvey Library is the Saint Augustine Center for Liberal Arts, commonly called "SAC", which is home to many departments in the College of Liberal Arts, numerous offices, several seminar-type classrooms, and the Advising and Professional Development Program. East of Corr Hall sits Kennedy Hall, named for the late President John F. Kennedy and the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy (both of whom spoke at Villanova commencement ceremonies), which houses the University Shop, the campus bookstore, as well as the Office of Residence Life, the Bursar's Office, the Office of Financial Aid, and the Main Campus mailroom. Across a small courtyard is Dougherty Hall, the campus's main dining hall, referred to as "The Pit" because of its underground location, one of three all-you-can-eat facilities on campus.  Dougherty also houses several smaller eateries and many Student Activity Offices. Next to Kennedy is Connelly Center with its radically different architecture resembling an alpine ski lodge, containing: the Belle Aire Terrace, which serves a variety of food; several meeting rooms; areas for group study; the Commuter Student Lounge on the upper level; another lounge on the lower level, the campus cinema (movie theater); a large conference room; a smoothie shop; and a Holy Grounds location. Between the dining halls of Dougherty and the meeting halls of Connelly is "The Oreo".  A large white-and-black sculpture by Jay Dugan, some of the major campus celebrations have occurred in its circular shadow – including celebratory vandalism in the wake of the 1985 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship. Sitting just west of The Quad, The Awakening (as it is officially known) has served as a meeting place in the heart of the campus for generations of Villanovans. Still further east, there is "The Quad" where there lies a square formation between two dormitories, Sheehan Hall and Sullivan Hall.  Bartley Hall, home to the Villanova School of Business is the last building before Ithan Avenue, which is where main campus ends.  Bartley is adjacent to another entrance to Main Campus, at the intersection of Lancaster Avenue and Ithan Avenue.  Behind Bartley Hall are two new buildings: The Health Services Building, home to the Counseling and Medical Centers; and Driscoll Hall, home to the College of Nursing. Situated across the SEPTA tracks north and west of Mendel hall is West Campus: home to St. Mary's Hall, the West Campus Apartments, and the Law School. St. Mary's, a labyrinthine building of classrooms, residence rooms, a cafeteria, and large chapel, was originally built as a seminary, and was once home to the College of Nursing. St. Mary's also houses many of the undergraduate student performing arts groups. Behind St. Mary's sit the Apartments – eight buildings that house junior and senior resident students. A small Augustinian residence, Burns Hall, also sits on West Campus and is the home to the University president. Picotte Hall at Dundale, a small mansion, lies just beyond Burns Hall at the far end of West Campus and is home to University Advancement, the school's phone-a-thon, and several other university offices. In addition to the student dormitories in St. Mary's Hall, West Campus is home to the following residence halls: One of three commuter train stops on campus, the Villanova Rail Station on the Paoli/Thorndale Line provides access to the city of Philadelphia, about 30 minutes away. Sitting diagonally across Lancaster Ave. and Ithan Ave. from Bartley Hall, South Campus is home to several residence halls – usually reserved for underclassmen – and Donahue Hall, home to "The Spit", short for "South Pit". Donahue hall also houses Donahue Market, commonly referred to by students as "The Sparket". The South Campus residence halls are: The second and third of three on-campus train stops, the Villanova stop and the Stadium stop on the Norristown High Speed Line provides access to the city of Philadelphia, about 30 minutes away. For more than a decade, Villanova University has been ranked No. 1 by U.S. News and World Report in the Best Masters Universities-category, Northern Region, a ranking for schools in the North which offer strong Masters, and undergraduate programs but have fewer doctorate programs. Villanova has several highly regarded academic programs, including an engineering school that is ranked No. 9 among undergraduate engineering programs whose highest degree is a masters. The Villanova School of Business was ranked No. 24 in the 2014 BusinessWeek rankings of undergraduate business schools, No. 69 in the 2012 U.S. News and World Report rankings of undergraduate business schools, and No. 29 in the Financial Times' ranking of top executive MBA programs.

Located in [[John Barry (naval officer)|Commodore John Barry]] Hall, the NROTC has been a part of the University since immediately after [[World War II]]. The battalion consists of more than 100 Navy and Marine Corps midshipmen under the advisement of a staff of Navy and Marine Corps officers and senior enlisted members.  Midshipmen in the Villanova NROTC program are required to take specific Navy and Marine Corps classes, wear their service's uniform on Tuesdays, attend physical training events, participate in extra-curricular programs that range from sports teams to rifle-shooting, and adhere to the basic premise that “a midshipman does not lie, cheat, or steal”.  Since its inception in the summer of 1946, the NROTC unit on campus has produced 22 Admirals and Generals in the United States Navy and Marine Corps.  At one point, there had only been two four-star generals in the U.S. Marine Corps, one of them the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and they had both been graduates of Villanova NROTC.

The Singers were established for the stated purpose of singing various types of music and enriching the cultural life of the university.<ref name=vusinghist>[http://vusingers.villanova.edu/Singers%20History.htm Vusingers.villanova.edu]</ref>  Entirely student-run, the Singers are governed by an 9-member board of students and sing a wide range of musical styles and types, ranging from classical to contemporary. Within the Singers, there exists a smaller, student-directed ''[[a cappella]]'' group known as the Spires.  Alumni of the Spires include [[Jim Croce]], [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]] and [[The Manhattan Transfer|Manhattan Transfer]] member [[Tim Hauser]].<ref name=vusinghist/>  The Villanova Voices [[women's chorus]] is the oldest women's organization at the university.  Originally called the Villanova Women's Glee Club, the group was founded by 20 women from the university's College of Nursing in 1960, shortly after Villanova became coeducational.  Their attendant ''a cappella'' group, the Haveners, is student-directed.<ref>[http://www.villanova.edu/studentlife/music/groups/vocal.htm#voices Villanova.edu] {{wayback|url=http://www.villanova.edu/studentlife/music/groups/vocal.htm#voices |date=20090212182549 }}</ref>  Villanova University is home to 7 [[a capella]] singing groups.

A book symbolizes Augustine's dedication to education and the [[New Testament]] where he found Christianity. A [[cincture]] is part of the [[religious habit|habit]] worn by members of the Order of Saint Augustine. Hovering above is the flaming heart, symbol of Augustine's search for God and his love of neighbors. Behind the book is the [[crosier]] — a staff traditionally held by a Bishop — commemorating Augustine's service as Bishop of [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]]. Above and behind the book are two [[Christian cross|cross]]es, symbolic of Augustine's conversion and the University's commitment to Christianity. Framing the central portion of the seal is a [[laurel wreath]] exemplifying victory through the pursuit of knowledge, and 1842 is the year of the University's founding. Surrounding the seal is the incorporated fide of the University: ''Universitas Villanova In Statu Pennsylvaniae''.  ===The Liberty Bell's "Sister Bell"===  [[File:Villanova Old Falvey.JPG|thumb|left|The old wing of the [[Falvey Library]].]]  Villanova University was home to the [[Liberty Bell]]'s "Sister Bell," the replacement bell ordered from the Whitechapel Bell Foundry after the original bell cracked in 1753.<ref name="sisterbell1">{{cite web|url=http://publications.villanova.edu/vumagazine/fall2003/sister_bell.htm|title=Villanova Magazine Fall 2003 Edition|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> This new bell was installed at the Pennsylvania State House ([[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]), and attached to the State House clock. The Sister Bell rang the hours until the late 1820s, when the bell was removed during a renovation and loaned to the [[Olde St. Augustine Church]] in Philadelphia. In 1829, the bell was hung in a new cupola and tower designed by architect [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]]. There it remained until May 8, 1844, when it was destroyed, along with the Olde St. Augustine Church, during the [[Philadelphia Nativist Riots]]. The friars of the [[Order of Saint Augustine]] had the "Sister Bell" recast and transferred to Villanova University.<ref name="sisterbell1"/> The bell was moved off campus in 2011.  At the university's centennial celebration, the bell was rung by [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty|Archbishop Dennis Joseph Dougherty]] to open the ceremonies.

Some of these include the existence of secret tunnels and catacombs under campus, the haunting of some of the older dormitories (sometimes linked to their use as hospitals during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]),<ref name="villanovan2405" /> and speculation over the existence of an entire wing of St. Mary's Hall which is completely blocked off.  The three buildings most commonly discussed as being haunted are Alumni Hall (located by St. Thomas of Villanova church on the main campus), St. Mary's Hall and Dundale (both located on the west campus).  Alumni Hall dates back to 1848 and stands as one of the oldest structures on campus. The school was closed in 1861 due to the Civil War and reopened in 1865. In that time this hall is believed to have been used as a military hospital and potential evidence of that use, such as a pulley located at the top of the main stairwell for moving bodies up and down, can still be seen. The building was used as a hospital again for influenza patients after World War I.<ref name="villanovan2405" />  This history has led to rumors that the building is haunted, the most prominent being that a high-ranking Confederate officer captured at Gettysburg was treated in Alumni Hall and was murdered by a Union soldier in his sleep.  St. Mary's Hall was built in 1962 and served as an Augustinian Seminary until 1972.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Laid out with long corridors and over a thousand rooms, there is a large chapel and many partial floors, basements and sub-basements to feed the legends of blocked off wings.<ref name="villanovan2405" />  The property on which Dundale Hall is located was originally purchased by an industrialist, Israel Morris II, in 1874, and was built as a mansion for his family. Purchased from his family in 1978, it has been used for a variety of meetings and is home to several offices. On more than a handful of occasions, the school's Public Safety officers have been called out late at night to investigate lights in the building coming on inexplicably.<ref name="villanovan2405" />  ==Alumni== {{Main|List of alumni of Villanova University}} Villanova University has produced many notable alumni.  [[Golden Globe]]-nominated actress [[Maria Bello]] got her first taste of the stage in a production at Vasey Hall. Actor and [[Coen Brothers]] favorite [[Jon Polito]] has garnered both stage and screen awards, and NFL Hall of Famer, longtime FOX commentator and feature film actor [[Howie Long]] graduated in 1982. [[Tim Hauser]], founder of [[The Manhattan Transfer|Manhattan Transfer]], [[Jim Croce]], and [[Don McLean]] have all been prominent members of the musical tradition at Villanova.

[[Joseph Clancy (Secret Service)|Joe Clancy]], a veteran [[US Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and the Agency's current director, graduated in 1978.  The business world, too, has had several prominent businessmen who got their start at Villanova. [[Robert J. Darretta, Jr.]] – chief financial officer and vice chairman of [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[John Drosdick]] – former CEO of [[Sunoco]], [[Thomas G. Labrecque]] – former Chairman and CEO of [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], [[Francis Saul]] – president of [[Chevy Chase (Bank)]], and [[Martin McGuinn]] – former CEO of [[Mellon Financial Corp.]] have all studied at Villanova at some point in their careers.

West Campus contains the Law School, St. Mary's hall (a large building for single housing, a cafeteria, classrooms, indoor swimming pool, market, etc.) some administrative buildings, and housing for juniors as well as some seniors who are permitted to live on campus. Also included are basketball and tennis courts, soccer fields, volleyball courts and barbecue pits. The SEPTA Paoli/Thorndale station – Villanova is also here. There is also the Law School parking garage in addition to apartment parking. South Campus contains six freshman residence halls, Donohue Court (South Campus Cafeteria) and Donohue Market (South Campus Market). The Norristown High Speed Line has a stop right behind Stanford Hall. Mendel Hall, named for pioneering geneticist and Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel, holds science labs, lecture halls, and other facilities. Its two large buildings are connected underground and by a second-floor indoor bridge that forms the gateway between West and Main Campus. In 1998, the college commissioned a  bronze sculpture of Mendel by Philadelphia sculptor James Peniston, and installed it outside the hall's entrance. Tolentine Hall, one of the oldest buildings on campus, houses classrooms, academic offices such as the Registrar's Office and the Office of the President, and computer labs, and is connected to Villanova's monastery, St. Thomas Hall. Tolentine Hall was formerly called Mendel Hall before the construction of the new Mendel Hall, as it was the former home of the various science departments, a fact which ultimately led to the building partially burning down more than once as a result of experiments gone wrong. White Hall, consisting mainly of classrooms and laboratories, is connected to the Chemical Engineering Building, which was built in 1947. Ironically, White Hall has an almost entirely black exterior. Falvey Hall, or "Old Falvey", is the annex of the Falvey Memorial Library, named for Rev. Daniel Falvey who served as librarian from 1940 until his death in 1962.  It is home to some classrooms in the Art History and Education departments as well as some offices, along with the Augustinian Heritage Institute, and the Matthew J. Ryan Center. "Old Falvey" was home to the writing center and Math Learning Resource Center (MLRC) until both centers moved into Falvey Memorial Library's renovated second floor during the 2012-2013 academic year. John Barry Hall, named for naval officer Commodore John Barry, houses the Navy ROTC Program.  To the west of the Church, the Center for Engineering Education and Research (CEER), which opened in 1998, holds engineering labs, engineering classrooms, an engineering computer lab, an auditorium hall for projections and slideshows, and a Holy Grounds, which is the name of Villanova's coffee shops.
