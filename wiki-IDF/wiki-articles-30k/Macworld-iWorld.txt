 Produced by Boston-based IDG World Expo, Macworld/iWorld  is a trade-show with conference tracks dedicated to the Apple Macintosh platform. It is held annually in the United States during January. Originally Macworld Expo and then Macworld Conference & Exposition, the gathering dates back to 1985. Macworld is the most widely read Macintosh magazine in North America and a trademark of Mac Publishing, a wholly owned subsidiary of International Data Group. IDG World Expo is also a subsidiary. The conference tracks are taught by leaders in their fields and require large admission fees. They last for a few more days than the Expo, which runs generally three or four days. Attendees can visit the exhibits, set up by hardware manufacturers and software publishers that support the Macintosh platform. On December 18, 2008, Apple announced that the 2009 Macworld Conference & Expo would be the last in which the company participates.   The first Macworld Expo occurred in 1985 in San Francisco. The conference itself was created by Peggy Kilburn, who helped to increase the size and profit of the event during her tenure (1985–1999). Among the speakers recruited by Kilburn were David Pogue, Steve Case, Bob LeVitus, as well as representatives from BMUG, LaserBoard, and other major user groups. The San Francisco event has always been held at the Moscone Center. The Expo was also held in Brooks Hall near the San Francisco Civic Center from 1985 until 1993, when the expansion of Moscone Center allowed the show to be consolidated in one location. Until 2005, the U.S. shows were held semiannually, with a January show in San Francisco and an additional summer show held in the Eastern US. The latter event was held initially in Boston at the Bayside Expo & Executive Conference Center, later expanding with a dual presence at the World Trade Center Boston. From 1998 to 2003 it took place in New York City's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The 2004 and 2005 summer shows, retitled Macworld Conference & Expo took place in Boston, although without Apple's participation. Other companies followed Apple's lead, canceling or reducing the size of their own exhibits, which resulted in reduced attendance compared with previous Macworld conferences. On 16 September 2005, IDG announced that no further summertime shows would be held in NYC or in Boston. The show has also taken place in other cities: Since 1997, the show has been known for its keynote presentations (sometimes called "Stevenotes") by Apple CEO Steve Jobs. In Boston, Steve Jobs gave a status report on Apple Inc.  Steve was the Chairman and CEO of Pixar. Steve addressed some of the comments that had been made about Apple:  "Apple has become irrelevant", "Apple can't execute anything", and "Apple's culture is anarchy; you can't manage it". Apple's sales were $11.1 billion in 1995, $9.5 billion in 1996, and $7 billion in 1997. Steve stated the falling sales were the fundamental problem. The beginning steps that Apple was going to take were: Board of Directors, Focus on Relevance, Invest in Core Assets, Meaningful Partnerships, and New Product Paradigm. Steve announced the new Board of Directors:  Ed Woolard, Chairman and former CEO of DuPont; Gareth Chang, President of Hughes International; Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle Corporation; Jerry York (businessman), former CFO of IBM and Chrysler; William Campbell (business executive), CEO of Intuit, and Steve Jobs himself. Steve addressed their Market Focus. Apple was the dominant market leader for creative professionals. 80% of all computers used in advertising, graphic design, prepress, and printing were Apple computers. 64% of internet websites were created on a Macintosh. Apple was the largest education company in the world. Apple sold 60% of all computers in education. They sold over $2 billion in annual revenues. Steve said the Apple's Core Assets were the Apple Brand and Mac OS. Steve said the Mac OS was still the best thing in the world. It had over 20 million active users, thousands of developers, and was a $1.5 billion software industry built around it. Steve said Apple is about the Mac OS. Steve said they released Mac OS 8 two weeks prior and had already sold 1,200,000 copies. Steve announced the partnership with Microsoft. Apple and Microsoft agreed to a patent cross license for existing patents and patents issued within the next five years. Microsoft made a five-year commitment to release Microsoft Office on the Mac. Microsoft would release the same number of major releases as on Windows. Apple decided Internet Explorer for Mac would be the default browser on Macintosh. Apple would be collaborating with Microsoft on Java (programming language) compatibility. Microsoft made a $150 million investment in Apple stock purchased at market price and agreed not to sell it for at least three years. Steve introduced Bill Gates via satellite. In San Francisco, Steve Jobs gave an update on the PowerPC G3 chip that was announced on November 10, 1997. Apple built three systems around this chip:  G3 Desktop, G3 MiniTower, and G3 PowerBook. The G3 Desktop sold for $1,999. The G3 MiniTower sold for $2,449. Apple had forecasted that they would sell 80,000 of the combined G3 computers. They actually shipped 133,000 computers in 51 days. If annualized, that would be 1,000,000 computers a year. Apple partnered with CompUSA to put an Apple store within their store. They had built 57 stores at that time and the rest were to be built by February 1998. In October 1997, before the stores went live, Macintosh computer sales were 3% of CompUSA's computer sales. In December 1997, Macintosh computer sales were 14%. The Apple Store (online) debuted on November 10, 1997. The online store had set a new standard for online commerce.

IDG World Expo reported that Macworld 2008 attendance increased 10% over the previous year.Macworld Conference & Expo Celebrates 24th Successful Year  The San Francisco show went on January 5–9, 2009. On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that the 2009 conference will be the last in which the company would participate. The conference's keynote address was delivered by Apple's Senior Vice President of Product Marketing Philip Schiller, not Steve Jobs, as has been the custom for the past ten years. Steve Jobs issued a press release stating that the reasons for his absence were health-related, specifically citing a hormone imbalance.

Also, Apple announced that iTunes would begin to sell all music DRM-free, with a three tier pricing system per track: $0.69, $0.99, and $1.29 (or £0.59, £0.79, and £0.99 in the UK). This differs from Apple's previous model with only one price per track of $0.99 (£0.79 in the UK). Apple also announced that tracks can now be downloaded over cellular networks on the iPhone. On March 30, 2009, IDG World Expo announced that the conference would be moving from January (when it had taken place for 25 years) to February. They also said:   The 2011 Macworld was held from January 25–29, 2011. The 2012 Macworld/iWorld was held from January 26–28.

The 2013 Macworld/iWorld was from January 31 to February 2, 2013. The 2014 Macworld/iWorld was from March 27 to March 29, 2014. The 2015 Macworld/iWorld was suspended by IDG World Expo.http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/10/14/idg-cancels-macworldiworld-2015-conference-says-show-going-on-hiatus It was scheduled to be held from March 12 to March 14, 2015.http://www.technologytell.com/apple/132487/macworld-iworld-will-march-onward-in-2015/ During the Expo's first two decades, it became legendary for the parties that coincided with it, frequently with open bars, lavish hors d'oeuvres, and requisite T-shirts and other premium favors. Apple's developer parties featured high-profile entertainers like James Brown and Smash Mouth. Several years after the start of the Expo, MacWEEK had launched its weekly trade magazine and simultaneously initiated an exclusive party known as Mac the Knife, named for its anonymous columnist that wrote the back page industry gossip and rumor section; after MacWEEK's demise, the party was thrown by Ilene Hoffman, until Mac Publishing, owners of the Mac the Knife trademark, forbade her from using the name. The party continued, with appearances by the Macworld All-Star Band, under a series of names that referenced the Knife. Robert Hess of MacWEEK was the original keeper of the Macworld Party List, which kept track of each leisure event after the show. Prior to his death in 1996, he reportedly requested Hoffman to maintain it; the list was subsequently renamed the Robert Hess Memorial Events List. The list shrunk gradually as events became more sparse, and did not publish for the show in New York 2003, but has been published for subsequent San Francisco shows. A Tokyo show, produced by IDG World Expo Japan, was held at Makuhari Messe and moved to Tokyo Big Sight in 2002. Macworld Expo Summit, a version of the show targeted at U.S. government customers, was held at the Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. as late as 1994. In 2004, Macworld UK, part of the IDG UK division of IDG, created two Macworld Conference events on its own: one standalone conference, and one conference adjoining the MacExpo trade show in London.
