   Fa Mulan is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 36th animated feature film Mulan (1998) and its sequel Mulan II (2004). Chinese-American actress Ming-Na Wen provides the character's speaking voice, while Filipina singer Lea Salonga provides her singing voice; Salonga had originally been slated to voice the character entirely. Created by Robert D. San Souci and animated by Mark Henn, Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior Hua Mulan from the poem the Ballad of Mulan. In the film, the character is depicted as the only daughter of an elderly war veteran who lives in fear of dishonoring her family. When her father is conscripted by the Chinese army to defend the country against the Huns, Mulan breaks both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man and enlisting herself in the army in lieu of her father. Mulan is also the only current Disney princess who is not in fact a legitimate princess (see below). Mulan was originally conceived as an oppressed Chinese girl who elopes to Europe with a British prince. Inspired by his own daughters, director Tony Bancroft wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine, describing her as a strong and independent young woman whose ultimate well-being is not reliant on a male character; the romantic arc between Mulan and Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot. Meanwhile, Henn animated Mulan so that she would appear less feminine than Disney's previous animated heroines. Reception towards Mulan has been generally positive, with critics praising her personality and heroism. However, mild criticism was directed towards her alleged Westernization. Meanwhile, the character's relationship with Shang has been widely panned; critics complained that Mulan's heroism was ultimately compromised by the film's romantic conclusion. The Disney production of Mulan was a reinterpretation of a Chinese ballad, but a cultural appropriation of this legend into adhering to the Disney formula. Chronologically, Mulan is the eighth member of the Disney Princess franchise. She is also the franchise's first East Asian princess. Critics have observed several ways in which Mulan and her role in the film differs from those of traditional Disney Princesses, drawing similarities between Mulan and preceding Disney Princesses Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991), Jasmine from Aladdin (1992) and Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995). Mulan was originally conceived in 1994 as an animated short film entitled China Doll, in which the heroine was initially supposed to have been depicted as "an oppressed and miserable Chinese girl who is whisked away by a British Prince Charming to happiness in the West." While researching, exploring and developing a series of traditional stories, fairy tales and folktales, award-winning children's book author and Disney story consultant Robert D. San Souci uncovered the Ballad of Mulan, an ancient Chinese poem conveying the story of Hua Mulan—a young Chinese woman who takes her ailing father's place in battle by disguising herself as a man and fought as a well-respected warrior for twelve years unnoticed. San Souci explained that, as a writer, "[Hua Mulan's] story fascinated me," and suggested to Disney that the studio ultimately combines the two stories. San Souci himself was hired to write the film's treatment and story. Thematically, Mulan explores the age-old idea and concept of remaining "true to yourself," with co-director Tony Bancroft summarizing Mulan's role in the film as "the story of a girl who can't help who she is but she exists in a different society that tells her who she is supposed to be." Although she disobeys they law by joining the Chinese army a female pretending to be a male, she is forgiven for her gender impersonation when her bravery to go against the military code helps to defeat the Huns and saves China. San Souci wanted to "keep&nbsp;... the integrity of this heroine," as the Ballad of Mulan is "so well known and so beloved". However, certain creative liberties were taken with the story specifically pertaining to Mulan's role. For example, in the original poem, Mulan first seeks permission from her rather supportive parents prior to enlisting herself in the army, whereas in the film she runs away from home as they sleep, and her surname was also changed from "Hua" to "Fa." Most notably, Mulan's true identity as a woman is revealed in the Disney film adaptation much earlier than it is in the poem; in the film her gender is discovered after the army's initial encounter with the enemy, whereas in the legend her comrades never discovered who she was in their twelve years at war, and only realized the truth after she had returned home. In addition, unlike preceding traditional Disney animated feature films, the developing romantic relationship between Mulan and Li Shang is treated as more of a subplot as opposed to a traditional central plot, as observed by film critic Andy Klein of Animation World Network. Klein commented, "Mulan isn't waiting for her prince to someday come; when he does arrive, having known her primarily as a man, and having learned to admire her for her deeper qualities, the romance is muted and subtle." Throughout the movie they are constantly working towards helping each other change into better and truer versions of themselves in order to achieve their true potential. Mulan's speaking voice is provided by Chinese-American actress Ming-Na Wen. Because the character "represented [traditional] Chinese values" and is depicted as being "dramatic&nbsp;... close to her father, very respectful," Bancroft believed that Wen possessed the "perfect" voice for Mulan, which he additionally described as "very Chinese." Born and raised in Macau, China, Wen was very much familiar with both the legend of Hua Mulan and the Ballad of Mulan at the time of her audition for the role, having grown up being read the poem by her mother. Wen explained, "I think every Chinese kid grows up with this story," additionally likening the poem's popularity in China to that of the Western Parson Weems fable in which American president George Washington chops down his father's beloved cherry tree. Mulan served as Wen's first voice-acting role. In an interview with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically the fact that she was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations. Upon being cast as Mulan's speaking voice, Wen was immediately informed by Disney that she would not be providing the character's singing voice. The actress took no offense to this decision, commenting jokingly "I don't blame them." The directors hired Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga to dub the character's respective singing voice, heard in the film's songs "Reflection", "I'll Make a Man Out of You" and "A Girl Worth Fighting For", on Wen's behalf. According to Thomas S. Hischak, author of the book Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary, Salonga was originally cast to provide both Mulan's speaking and singing voices. However, the directors eventually felt that her attempt at impersonating a man in the form of Mulan's male alter-ego "Ping" was rather unconvincing, and ultimately replacing Salonga with Wen. Six years prior to Mulan, Salonga provided the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Disney's Aladdin (1992) on behalf of American actress Linda Larkin. While auditioning for Mulan, Salonga asked jokingly, "Why do I have to audition?&nbsp;... I was already a princess before. Wasn't that enough?" The film's screenplay was constantly being revised and re-written. Naturally, so was Mulan's characterization and role in the film. The writers wanted Mulan to represent a "different kind of Disney heroine," specifically described as one who "didn't need a tiara, but was still just as much as graceful, strong, and courageous." Between the two, Bancroft and his twin brother Tom, an animator who also worked on Mulan, have a total of seven daughters. This further inspired the filmmakers to portray Mulan as a unique heroine who is "not another damsel in distress" in favor of having her resemble "a strong female Disney character who would truly be the heroine of her own story" instead, essentially a "female role model. The characteristics of strength and courage were a must for Mulan." In an interview with The Christian Post, Bancroft elaborated on the way in which he, as the film's director, continued to consider the well-being of his two young daughters while working on Mulan, having "wanted to make&nbsp;... a unique heroine that hadn't been seen before" and provide for them "someone who would be strong on her own, without a prince saving her." Addressing the way in which Mulan differs from traditional Disney heroines and princesses, Bancroft explained, "Most Disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change. Mulan stays consistent. From the first frame all the way through the end of the movie, her personality, her drive it all stays the same." Visually, the animators were influenced by both traditional Chinese and Japanese artwork. In the specific case of Mulan, "The characters' simple lines&nbsp;... resemble classic Asian painting", as demonstrated by the animators' innovate "'less is more' approach" to traditional animation. Chinese artist Chen Yi mentored the animators, "helping [them] to come up with these designs." Mark Henn served as Mulan's supervising animator. Animating the character in her male disguise as "Ping" offered an unprecedented challenge for Henn. In order to solve this unique dilemma, Henn was provided with "the opportunity to&nbsp;... adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as Ping, as a soldier, that she was physically a little different in how we drew her than when she was herself as Mulan." Physically, Mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional Disney animated heroines, specifically Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995) and Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), because "you can't pass as a man in the army with a Barbie-style figure." Henn revealed that he was drawn to "Mulan's story [because it] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic&nbsp;... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across." In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters. Several film critics have described Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, "In this slightly modernized version of the story, Mulan&nbsp;... is something of a rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife, despite her sighing parents' wishes." Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television, wrote that "Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy," observing the way in which the character speaks using a full mouth. Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character's clumsy, awkward demeanor; broad shoulders and muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her "traditionally slim Disney waist." Additionally, Mulan's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as "brainy."  The Huns, led by Shan Yu, invade Han China, forcing the Chinese emperor to command a general mobilization. The emperor requires one man from each family to join the Chinese army. When Fa Mulan hears that her elderly father Fa Zhou, the only man in their family, is forced to rejoin the army, she decides to stand in his place, disguising herself as a young man named "Ping". Mulan's family learns that she has taken Fa Zhou's place and pray to their family ancestors, who then order their "Great Stone Dragon" to protect her. The ancestors are unaware that the statue of Great Stone Dragon failed to come to life, and that Mushu, a small dragon is the one to go and protect Mulan. Mulan is initially misguided by Mushu who encourages her to go to war and in how to behave like a man. However, under command of Li Shang, she and her new friends at the camp, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po, become skilled warriors. Mushu, desiring to see Mulan succeed, creates a fake order from Li Shang's father, General Li, ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains. They arrive at a burnt-out village and discover that General Li and his forces have been wiped out by the Huns. As they solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns when Mushu accidentally fired a cannon causing their position to be given away, but a second firing of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche. Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle, and she is forced to reveal her deception when she receives medical attention. Instead of executing Mulan as the law states, Li Shang spares her life for saving his life from the avalanche by leaving her on the mountain as the rest of the army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns' demise. However, the avalanche failed to eliminate all the enemies, as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns, including Shan Yu, making their way to the City, intent on capturing the Emperor. In the Imperial City, Mulan attempts to warn Li Shang about Shan Yu, but he refuses to listen. The Huns appear and capture the Emperor, locking themselves inside the palace. With Mulan's help, Li Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines and are able to enter the palace and defeat Shan Yu's men. As Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun onto the roof where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions, Mushu fires a bundle of fireworks rockets at Shan Yu on her signal and kills him. Mulan is praised by the Emperor and the people of China, who all bow to her, an unprecedented honor. Mulan accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts, but politely declines his offer to be his advisor and instead asks to return to her family. She returns home and presents the imperial gifts to her father, but he is more overjoyed to have his daughter back safely. Li Shang, who has become enamored with Mulan, soon arrives under the guise of returning her helmet, but accepts the family's invitation for dinner. Earlier in the film, Mulan was declared unfit for marriage, but this now appears not to be the case with her strong budding romance with Li Shang. Mushu is granted a position as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration.  The sequel finds Mulan and Li Shang preparing to marry but distracted by a task from the Emperor, who wants his three daughters escorted to their own marriage ceremony. Their romantic relationship becomes somewhat strained during the trip, as the romantic couple has differing views on various issues. Meanwhile, Mushu realizes that if Mulan marries Shang, she will not need him anymore as her guardian spirit. Taking advantage of this, he manages to trick the two into breaking up. When bandits attack, Mulan and Shang fight them off, but Mulan is devastated when Shang is seemingly killed trying to save her. To make sure the three princesses are not forced to marry against their will, Mulan takes their place marrying the eldest son of the ruler of the neighboring land. Shang survives the accident and arrives in time to stop the wedding but ultimately Mulan is saved by Mushu who, posing as the mighty Golden Dragon of Unity, frees the three princesses from their vows, and marries Mulan and Li Shang himself causing Mulan to forgive him for his actions. Afterwards, Mulan informs Li Shang of Mushu's existence and he combines the temples of his family and hers, allowing Mushu to keep his position. Mulan is the eighth official member the Disney Princess franchise, a media franchise marketed towards young girls. As children, the characters such as Mulan, demonstrates the positive aspects of: never giving up, not being restricted to gender roles and the importance of family and honor. These aspects of the film are more in keeping with a traditional Chinese perspective on cultural value, such as the importance of family and honor. Featured on the official Disney Princess website, the character's brief biography reads, "Mulan is a loving girl who is always brave and bold. When her country needs it most, she disguises herself as a man and goes off to fight. She uses courage and determination to win the day." Interestingly, Mulan is currently the only official member of the Disney Princess franchise who is technically not a legitimate princess "in the traditional sense" because of the fact that she was not born the daughter of a king or queen, nor does she become princess consort by marrying a prince. Additionally, she is also the franchise's first and currently only East Asian member.  Mulan appears as a playable character in Disney's Story Studio: Mulan, an action video game released in December 1999 by Disney Interactive Studios exclusively for the video game console Sony PlayStation. Loosely based on the plot of the original animated film, the video game's concept and premise revolves around "Players&nbsp;... assum[ing] the role of Mulan on her quest to recover the missing scrolls." Mulan also appears as a playable character in Disney's Mulan, a similar video game released the previous year on October 10, 1998 by THQ for Nintendo Game Boy. Additionally, Mulan appears in the video game Kingdom Hearts II in the Land of the Dragons world. She aids Sora in battle, taking the place of either Donald or Goofy. She uses a jian called "Sword of the Ancestor" for regular combat, and her combination attacks include Red Rocket and other fire attacks, thanks to Mushu. She goes under her pseudonym (Ping) for the majority of Sora's first visit to her world, but has abandoned it by the time of their second visit, which follows an original storyline. Mulan makes cameo appearances in the Disney's House of Mouse television series and the direct-to-video release Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse. She was scheduled to appear in the second installment of the Disney Princess Enchanted Tales series of DVDs along with Cinderella. It was to premiere in 2008 but was cancelled due to poor sales of the first DVD. Mulan appears regularly for meet-and-greets, parades and shows at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, including at the Chinese Pavilion at Epcot. Mulan and Mushu, as a kite, make cameo appearances in the Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Resort versions of It's a Small World. In Disneyland, she also makes appearances in the Disney Princess Fantasy Faire Village and regularly performs in the new show Mickey and the Magical Map in the Fantasyland Theater.  In the aforementioned show, she performs a trio with fellow Disney Princesses Pocahontas and Rapunzel.  As a tribute, there is a portrait of her along other Disney Princesses at the Princess Fairytale Hall at the Magic Kingdom. On the Disney Cruise Line ships and in Hong Kong Disneyland, Mulan and Li Shang appear in the stage show The Golden Mickeys. Mulan is also known to come out for meet-and-greets on the ships as well. She is also featured in the Disney on Ice shows Princess Classics and Princess Wishes. In the Square Enix and Disney game Kingdom Hearts II, Mulan is a playable character when the protagonists visit her world. Actress Jamie Chung portrays a live-action version of Mulan in the second, third and fifth seasons of the ABC television series, Once Upon a Time. She first appeared in the series' second season premiere, "Broken", assisting Prince Phillip in rescuing Aurora. The Once Upon a Time version of Mulan differs from the film version as she is in love with Aurora, as revealed in the 2013 episode "Quite a Common Fairy". On August 2014, Ming-Na Wen and Lea Salonga reprise their roles as Mulan for the first time since Mulan 2 in the Disney Channel show Sofia the First.  In the episode "Princesses To The Rescue," Mulan reminds Sofia and her friends Amber and Jun they are "Stronger Than They Know" in song.  Mulan is the 7th Disney princess to appear on the show. Disney Infinity 3.0 has announced and released Mulan as one of the playable characters and figures. As a character, critical reception towards Mulan has been generally positive. Time Out described Mulan as "A feisty young go-getter [who] rises above the male-dominated world in which she lives." Similarly, Ken Fox of TV Guide wrote, "Intelligent and fiercely independent, Mulan&nbsp;... runs afoul of social expectations that a woman will be always obedient and duty-bound to her husband." Bridget Byrne of Boxoffice commented, "The physical and dramatic energy of&nbsp;... Mulan&nbsp;... almost triumph over the old-fashioned forces of Disney tradition." Byrne continued, "Mulan&nbsp;... has pride, charm, spirit and aesthetic appeal which prevents her from being upstaged by the vigorous and exciting action in which she participates." Variety's [[Todd McCarthy]] praised the character for inspiring "a turn of the circle from such age-old Disney classics&nbsp;... in which passive heroines were rescued by blandly noble princes. Here, it's the girl who does the rescuing, saving not only the prince but the emperor himself from oblivion, and this in a distant culture where women were expected to obey strictly prescribed rules."<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url = http://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/mulan-mulan-blazes-new-femme-territory-1200454130/|title = Review: 'Mulan – 'Mulan' Blazes New Femme Territory'|website = Variety|last = McCarthy|first = Todd|publisher = Variety Media, LLC|date = June 8, 1998|accessdate = February 25, 2014}}</ref> Similarly, Margaret A.

The artwork featured Mulan with blue eyes, bigger lips, noticeably lighter skin, and golden clothing which does not resemble any outfit she has worn in the film. Her new appearance has caused an uproar due to the [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]] of her character. This was particularly troubling as Mulan is one of the few princesses of color. Shavon L. McKinstry of ''SPARK Movement'' writes that Mulan's redesign "seem to be directly counter to her personality and character in her film", and also notes how all the princesses of color have been "noticeably pushed to the back or left out completely" from the new Disney merchandise which featured the redesigns.<ref name="multiple">McKinstry, Shavon L. [http://www.sparksummit.com/2013/04/17/bright-like-a-diamond-white-like-a-princess/ "Bright Like a Diamond, White Like a Princess"], ''SPARK MOVEMENT'', April 17, 2013. Retrieved April 4, 2014.</ref>  Through stereotypical images, dialogue and action, it is easy for the audience to make the distinction between good characters and bad characters. Good characters "have big eyes and round cheeks and are drawn in curves, smooth, round, soft bright and with European features" (Xu, M & Tian, C. 2013), while bad characters are defined by having "sharp angles, oversized, and often darkly" (Xu, M & Tian, C. 2013). Disney indisputably represents an empire of symbols of westernized imperialism and cultural hegemony and of globalization that dominates within their heroes. These visual keys help the audience know who to root for in the film and what behaviours and morals you wish to follow if you want to achieve greatness like the heroes.  McKinstry argues that Disney "prefers to portray one demographic of princess, simultaneously alienating so much of their fanbase", pointing out that of the "ten Disney Princesses in the brand, six are white".<ref name="multiple" /> The importance of Mulan and other non-white princesses can be seen in the 2009 study of the effects of children's cartoons on the body image of young girls by doctors Sharon Hayes and Stacey Tantleff-Dunn. The study revealed that in the group of girls ranging from 3 to 6 years old, 30.6% of the group would change their physical appearance if they could. Of these respondents, over half would change their hair and over a quarter would change something about their body, such as skin color. Of all girls surveyed, 8% said they would have to change their hair or skin color to become a princess, stating things like they would "change from brown skin to white skin", for example. The interviewed group was predominantly white.<ref>Hayes, S. and Tantleff-Dunn, S. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/026151009X424240/full "Am I too fat to be a princess?
