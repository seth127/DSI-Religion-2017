Situated in the Łódź Voivodeship (since 1999), previously part of Płock Voivodeship (1975–1998), it is the capital of Kutno County. Kutno was historically the center of a large Jewish community. In 1900, 10,356 Jews lived there.JewishGen.org It was the birthplace of famed Polish writer Sholem Ash. During the Invasion of Poland of 1939, Polish armies under General Tadeusz Kutrzeba conducted an offensive in and around Kutno, a battle that was later named the Battle of the Bzura. Based on its central location and the intersection of multiple rail lines, Kutno is one of the most important railroad junctions in Poland. Two main lines cross there (Łódź – Toruń and Warsaw – Poznań). Another connection starts in Kutno, which goes to Płock. Kutno is located in the northern part of Łódź province and is  to the northwest of the geographical center of Poland. According to data from 1 January 2009, the area of the town amounts to . According to the physical–geographic division of Poland, the town is placed on the western edge of Kutno plain, which is the part of Middle–Masovia macro region. At the south of Kutno plain, Kutno straddles the boundary of the Łowicko – Błońska plain, which belongs to the same region and the Kłodawa Upland plain, which spreads in the west, and is counted in the southern Greater Poland. To the north of the Przedecz – Gostynin line  Kujawskie lakeland begins, which is included in the Greater Poland lakeland. Kutno is located on the edge of four historical lands. Greater Poland, Kuyavia, Masovia and Łęczyca. It is located in what is virtually the center of Poland, at a point where geographical and historical borders, as well as in the crossing of communication lines, are of major importance to the development of the city. Kutno has maintained the administrative units of a town (Districts, housing developments), although certain parts of the town are simply called housing developments (e.g.: Łąkoszyn housing development). These divisions are mostly historical references.  For instance, the Łąkoszyn housing development is part of what remains of the town of Łąkoszyn town which was incorporated to Kutno. The following parts of Kutno have been formulated in the National Register of Country's Administrative Division: Antoniew, Azory, Bielawki, Dybów, Kościuszków, Kotliska Małe, Łąkoszyn, Puśniki, Sklęczki, Stara Wieś, Stodółki, Walentynów, Wiktoryn, Żwirownia.

The climate of Kutno is similar to that of the entire lowland region of Poland. The temperature is a result of continental and oceanic air flow patterns. The yearly temperature amounts to  and the mean kinetic temperature for past thirty years is  in January and  in July. Kutno is situated in a low precipitation zone in Poland. Its average yearly sum amounts to , although in particular years,  this sum could be lower. Summer (especially June) is period when the most intensive precipitation occurs. During that period, about 17% of Kutno's total yearly precipitation falls on the city. The seasons with the lowest amount of precipitation are the winter months, including March. Kutno has a small number of storms during the year. There are about five storms during year (about half of the national average). Snowfall remains on the ground for a comparatively short period of time, on average, 39 days in year. There are about 21 foggy days during the year in the municipal area. However, it is common that in lowlands of the Ochnia river, fog occurs quite often. Barometric pressure varies from 50% in September to 80% in December and there are 50 sunny and 130 cloudy days averagely during whole year. The wind set is similar to characteristics of other regions. It blows mostly in a westerly direction, while during the winter season, the wind blows more frequently toward the southwest. Summer is the season during which winds blow mostly in a northwesterly direction.      There are indications that the origin of the town may have taken place in the 12th century. The first mention of it was found in a document concerning an endowment of Łęczyca prepositure published due to a consecration of the collegiate church in Łęczyca in the year 1161. According to the local folklore, both the town and the parish came into being in 1250, although official documentation to that effect is lacking. Most probably, the town began to be settled some time between the 12th and the 14th centuries; its name appeared for the first time in a document from the year 1301. The document had been published for his son Ziemysław by Leszek, Przemysł and Kazimierz – duke of Kuyavia in the presence of three estate dignitaries as well as other people gathered during a convention in Włocławek. References to Kutno concern the appearance of rector Michał from the church in Kutno on the list of witnesses. In 1386, Duke Siemowit the IVth had given to Andrzej de Kutno the privilege of freeing Kutno and Sieciechów villages from all charges and burdens excluding two coins (Groschen) out of every crop fee. The role of the provincial courts was transferred to the Duke. In 1386, the village of Kutno was given trade rights, and 46 years later, in 1432 a town charter. The first records that define Kutno as a town appeared in 1444. 1 July 1504: Mikołaj of Kutno gained the right to hold the St. Wawrzyniec fair, improving development of the town's trade. In 1701, the Kucieński family gave up Kutno to Anna Zamojska. The Zamoyski family fought amongst themselves for the property for a long time. The town fell into debt but the situation had normalized when Andrzej Hieronim Zamoyski became the owner of Kutno. During that time Kutno was a town of prosperity and development. The town's prestige increased after King Augustus III of Poland ordered the construction of the Postal Palace and consequently the Saxon Palace was built. It was constructed between 1750 and 1753 after a royal track leading from Dresden to Warsaw had been built. The palace was decorated with rich interiors according to John M Walter's plans. In 1753, Kutno was completely burned, resulting in the loss of the town records along with the settlement grant. After the fire, the King's Lord Councillor Andrzej Zamoyski left Kutno in order to obtain another settlement grant, however, the town suffered another fire due to a march-pass in 1774 and easygoing attitude of soldiers. In 1775, Andrzej Zamoyski sold Kutno to Stanisław Kostka Gadomski – governor of Łęczyca province. Under his reign, Kutno became one of the biggest settlements in central Poland. The Second Partition of Poland occurred in 1793. Kutno had been completely under Prussian control and became part of the newly created South Prussia provinces. The whole province of Kutno became part of the Łęczyca department, then after the Third Partition, it became part of the Warsaw department. On 4 January 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte passed through Kutno. In 1807 due to a decision that had been made by Congress of Vienna, Kutno became part of the dukedom of Warsaw. An 1808 fire, most likely set by Napoleon's army, destroyed 180 houses. In 1809 Kutno was visited by Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. In 1826, the first town map was published due to the planned rebuilding of the town. In 1840, a chapel was built which later became the Museum of the Battle of the Bzura river. Built in the Neo-Renaissance style and rotunda shape and crowned with a dome, it is part of the Wiosny Ludów park. It formerly served as a mausoleum for the Rzątkowski and Mniewski families. Another fire destroyed nearly all of the houses on Królewska St. Only two buildings remained – nowadays Crocantino and MDM. In 1844, the first hospital in Kutno was opened. Founder of the ground, many building materials and the main executioner was former owner of Kutno town – Feliks Mniewski. City Hall has been raised in 1845 in classicistic style. Building located by the Marshall Piłsudski square is currently residence of the Regional Museum in which one can see mementos and records depicting history of Kutno. In 1862, the Warsaw – Bydgoszcz railway line opened, leading Kutno to become an important railway junction and a trade and industry center. Directly before and during the period of the January Uprising, Kutno was the seat of the head of the Gostynin province. In 1867, Kutno district was formed. This state endured until World War I outbreak. Famous writer Szalom Asz was born in Kutno in 1880. In his collection of short stories "Miasteczko" ("The Town") author showed situation of Jewish people from his family town – Kutno. Once for two years town organises Festival of Jewish Culture named by the Szalom Asz which has a literature contest about his works within its framework. In 1886, on place of a former gothical church St. Wawrzyniec Church (designed in a neo – gothical style by Konstantyn Wojciechowski) has been built. 5 January 1904, the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz stayed in Town's Theatre; which was the seat of Fire Brigade during that time. Income from lecture made by Nobel prize winner was given to the poor children in Kutno. At Wiosna Ludów park after the speech a ball had been made on which only men were allowed, other hand women could watch Sienkiewicz from unshuttered windows. From 15 to 16 October 1914, the Battle of Kutno took place between the Russian and German armies. The Russians lost the battle and the loss of Kutno provided direct access to Warsaw. In 1915, local parish priest Franciszek Pruski was executed by firing squad. The St. John the Baptist church has a memory plate concerning the event. Many Kutno inhabitants took part in the Polish-Bolshevik war, and were known as Lwów Eaglets. They also fought in the Siberian Division. After the war, hundreds of 15-year-old boys enlisted in the Army Mining Corps, today known as miner–soldiers. From April 1919 to January 1921, Charles de Gaulle stayed in Kutno as an instructor of the French military mission under general Louis Faury's command. On 5 March 1938, Kutno received a blazon that depicts two wild boars placed on the yellow background which stays on their back paws and lean on green bulrush.     The Battle of The Bzura river took place from 9 to 12 September 1939. On 9 September the Poznań army operational group, led by General Edmund Knoll-Kownacki, attacked the German 8th army led by General Johannes Blaskowitz. On 11 September Poland's Pomorze Army reinforced the Polish troops in battle. At first the Polish assault was successful but the Germans reinforced their troops on 12 September and started to counterattack. General Tadeusz Kutrzeba ordered Knoll to retreat beyond the Bzura river. Kutno remained outside the battle area. Despite the ultimate defeat of Polish army, the Battle of the Bzura river made the Germans change their strategy and regroup and also delayed the capitulation of Warsaw. On 16 September 1939 the German Wehrmacht moved into Kutno, bombarding trains, the railway station, and houses throughout the district. At the junction of what is now Kochanowski Street and Maja Street, a German saboteur laid down on the street as a target for the bombers which were bombing the railway station. The area administratively became part of the Third Reich's Reichsgau Wartheland, within the district/county (kreis) of Kutno. In December 1939 resettlement began in accordance with Nazi racial and ethnic policies, which aimed to make the town population purely German. People were forced to leave their houses early in the morning with only an hour's notice and could take only  of baggage and a small amount of money. Displacement was very often carried out with violence. People were transported by trucks or wagons and then in sealed trains. The trip was up to eight days long, in terrible conditions. On 14 April 1940 most of the teachers from Kutno district were arrested. Few survived having had left their houses earlier or having been arrested. Subsequently the Germans founded the ghetto in Kutno on 15 June 1940. The entire area of a former sugar factory ("Hortensja" or "Konstancja" according to various sources) was surrounded by barbed wire. On the first day Poles were forbidden to leave their houses while Jews were forced to take all their belongings and proceed to the factory. German soldiers and SS members beat Jews standing in the street. Eight thousand people were transferred to the area of the factory, within five living quarters. On the first day, crowded and without any first-aid stations, a few people died. The only food they had was a small amount of potatoes and bread. Prices of extra food were very high, for instance one kilogram of potatoes cost 40 fen. in ghetto which would have cost 5 fen in the rest of the town. However, the true nightmare started during winter when there was not enough firewood, so that Jews had to warm themselves with burned furniture or scaffolding. In the following year, 1941, due to overcrowding of resettled people and transport difficulties in 7th Przemyślowa st., another concentration camp was founded. Due to terrible conditions in the camp about 10 persons per day died of dysentery. On 9 June 1941, at present-day Wolności Square, three Poles, Kalikst Perkowski, Wilhelm Czernecki and Piotr Sanda, were publicly executed. They were sentenced to death for smuggling food to Warsaw. Their deaths was intended to be a lesson and the presence of locals at the execution was compulsory; even the family of the executed was there. On 19 March 1942 the ghetto was closed. All Jews, in alphabetical order, were transported to Koło and then to Chełmno extermination camp. Six thousand Jewish inhabitants of Kutno were killed there while elder people who had been ghetto administrators were killed in Kutno town. Additionally, a forced labor camp operated in the area from January 1942 until January 1945.Zwangsarbeit im NS-Staat at German Federal Archive (Bundesarchiv). [ ] Accessed 9/29/11.

After his death, the name of the square was changed to 19 January Square (the date related to the liberation of Kutno by the Red Army). Former names of the streets in Kutno: According to a widespread story, Kutno was supposed to have been founded by Count Piotr from Kutna Hora, who had escaped in 997 with the brother of Bishop Wojciech from Bohemia to Poland.  Kutno, the town, was founded as an heirloom of a family estate. J. Łukawski, the publisher of Liber beneficiorum by J. Ławski, placed a footnote on page 478, with the following account: "When Piotr of Kutno came to Poland in the year 997, he founded Kutno in memory of his manor house in the Bohemia. The parish church was founded along with the settlement. Piotr's ancestors designated themselves as the Counts of Kutno and later assumed the name of Kucieńscy". However, this story is not considered to be reliable and is rejected by most historians due to a its doubtful origin. It is treated as an 18th-century legend or possibly a varnished version of the origins some "noble" families. The geographic dictionary of Polish Kingdom, commonly known as "Kąty", gives the impression that Kutno could have been named "Kątno" originally. The source of this legend is likely because of the similarities between names Kutno and Kutná Hora. First references to Kutná Hora were made in 1289, whereas about Kutno itself was not noted until 1301. In addition, in the 10th century Poles were not founding towns, as an equivalent. Instead, they had strongholds which were changed in the 13th century.
