   New York State Route&nbsp;5 (NY&nbsp;5) is a state highway that extends for  across the state of New York in the United States. It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in the Chautauqua County town of Ripley and passes through Buffalo, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady, and several other smaller cities and communities on its way to downtown Albany in Albany County, where it terminates at U.S. Route&nbsp;9 (US&nbsp;9), here routed along the service roads for Interstate&nbsp;787 (I-787). Prior to the construction of the New York State Thruway, it was one of two main east–west highways traversing upstate New York, the other being US&nbsp;20. West of New York, NY&nbsp;5 continues as Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;5 (PA&nbsp;5) to Erie. NY&nbsp;5 overlaps with US&nbsp;20 twice along its routing. The second, a  overlap through western and central New York, is the second-longest concurrency in the state, stretching from Avon east to the city of Auburn in Cayuga County. The concurrency is known locally as "Routes 5 and 20". As the route proceeds across the state, it also directly or indirectly meets every major north–south highway in upstate New York, including all three north–south Interstate Highways (I-390 in Avon, I-81 in Syracuse via US&nbsp;11, and I-87 in Albany). NY&nbsp;5 was assigned in 1924 as a true cross-state highway, extending from the Pennsylvania state line in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east, mostly by way of modern US&nbsp;20. At the time, modern NY&nbsp;5 between Buffalo and Albany was designated as New York State Route&nbsp;5A. By 1926, NY&nbsp;5 was moved onto the routing of NY&nbsp;5A while the old routing of NY&nbsp;5 became NY&nbsp;7. It was truncated in 1927 to Athol Springs in the west and Albany in the east following the assignment of US&nbsp;20, and again in 1930 to downtown Buffalo. NY&nbsp;5 was reextended to the Pennsylvania state line  by way of its old routing to Athol Springs, an old alignment of US&nbsp;20, and a lakeside spur route of US&nbsp;20 that had been assigned in 1930. Only local realignments have occurred since. Although it is no longer commonly used for long distance travel, NY&nbsp;5 is still regionally important. NY&nbsp;5 is named Main Street in Buffalo, Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street in Syracuse, State Street in Schenectady, and Central Avenue in Albany, the state capital. It is a major local road in many other locations along its path. NY&nbsp;5 runs concurrent to US&nbsp;20 twice between its endpoints: for three miles (5&nbsp;km) between Silver Creek and Irving and for  across western and central New York. At 67.6 miles (108&nbsp;km) in length, the eastern overlap between US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 is the longest surface-road concurrency in New York state, behind only the concurrency of I-86 and NY&nbsp;17 in the Southern Tier.  Maintenance of the majority of NY&nbsp;5's  is performed by the New York State Department of Transportation. However, locally owned and maintained sections exist in six cities. The city-maintained sections of NY&nbsp;5 are in Buffalo from NY&nbsp;16 north to the city line (except of the Goodell Street portion, which is state-maintained); in Syracuse between the western city line and just west of NY&nbsp;635; in Utica from Leland Avenue east to the city line; in Amsterdam between Division and West Main streets; in Schenectady from Washington Avenue to the eastern city line; and the entirety of NY&nbsp;5 within Albany. At the New York–Pennsylvania border in Ripley, PA&nbsp;5 becomes NY&nbsp;5 upon entering New York. It very closely follows the shore of Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US&nbsp;20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY&nbsp;438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant in the city of Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY&nbsp;5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY&nbsp;5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.  A short distance past the city line, NY&nbsp;5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on a span of the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a pair of frontage roads, both named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the service roads and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until the northern end of the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY&nbsp;5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes First Niagara Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit&nbsp;7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall. NY&nbsp;384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY&nbsp;5 turns east onto Church. At Main Street, Church Street splits into a pair of one-way streets and becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an intersection with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, which includes the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;16, NY&nbsp;5 turns northward, rejoining NY&nbsp;5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper Street, where NY&nbsp;5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY&nbsp;5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell Street. NY&nbsp;5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY&nbsp;5 westbound at the intersection.  The route continues along Main Street throughout the remainder of its length in Buffalo, cutting through the city diagonally from southwest to northeast until it enters the town of Amherst at the intersection of Bailey Avenue (US&nbsp;62) at the south campus of the University at Buffalo. Once leaving the city of Buffalo, NY&nbsp;5 heads east through the densely populated suburban town of Amherst, including the hamlets of Snyder and Eggertsville and the village of Williamsville and is heavily developed through the entire length of the town, particularly at the intersection with Transit Road (NY&nbsp;78). In the town of Clarence, the road dips into a significant depression known as Clarence Hollow. Once leaving Clarence, NY&nbsp;5 goes through predominantly rural areas until reaching the city of Batavia in Genesee County, closely paralleling the New York State Thruway through much of the county. The road travels eastward until reaching Livingston County and the village of Caledonia. NY&nbsp;5 heads southeast from the village of Caledonia, paralleling the former right-of-way of an Erie&ndash;Lackawanna Railroad branch line that connected the villages of Caledonia and Avon as it heads through spacious fields containing little more than farmland. At a rural intersection controlled by single-head flashing traffic signals west of Avon, NY&nbsp;5 meets US&nbsp;20 for the second time. The routes embark on a second concurrency, merging onto the right-of-way of NY&nbsp;5 as they cross the Genesee River and enter both the town and village of Avon. US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 become West Main Street upon entering the village, underscoring the road's status as the primary east&ndash;west highway through the town. The route continues southeast from the Genesee, passing through the forested but sparsely populated western area of the village. As the route approaches the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad (LAL) grade crossing, the number of homes increases rapidly, only to be replaced by businesses in the area surrounding the LAL mainline. Located on the western edge of this transition is NY&nbsp;39, which terminates at this junction. Past the tracks, West Main intersects Rochester Street, a locally important north&ndash;south two-lane arterial that continues north of the village to the Rochester suburb of Brighton as East River Road. Shortly after this intersection, the homes return, following US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 as West Main enters the heart of the village.  In the center of Avon, West Main feeds into Park Place, a large traffic circle providing access to two local streets from US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5. The routes follow the circle counterclockwise, departing the roundabout on East Main Street. The street proceeds east, passing through four blocks of densely populated neighborhoods before exiting the village and abruptly entering vast, barren fields to the east. US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5, now named Avon&ndash;Lima Road, intersects NY&nbsp;15 two miles (3&nbsp;km) to the east in East Avon, a community based around the intersection and the streets comprising it, and connects to I-390 at exit&nbsp;10 a half-mile from NY&nbsp;15. Continuing on, the road intersects a number of county routes over the next four miles (6&nbsp;km) before becoming West Main Street once more, this time for the village of Lima. At an intersection with NY&nbsp;15A in the village center, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 become East Main Street, retaining the name to the Ontario County line at Honeoye Creek. In the town of West Bloomfield, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 meet the southern terminus of NY&nbsp;65. Exiting the hamlet, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. A mile and a half from the town line, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 intersect NY&nbsp;64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5. NY&nbsp;64, whose right-of-way ends at US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 at the foot of a small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY&nbsp;444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY&nbsp;444, US&nbsp;20, NY&nbsp;5 and NY&nbsp;64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.  A mile to the east at Whalen Road, NY&nbsp;64 separates from US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5, following the road, and US&nbsp;20A, which has its eastern terminus at this intersection, south toward Bristol. US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 continue on through rural Ontario County before splitting from its easterly alignment at an intersection four miles (6&nbsp;km) east of US&nbsp;20A and NY&nbsp;64 in the town of Canandaigua. West Avenue, the former routing of US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 into downtown Canandaigua, continues east from the junction while US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 turn south onto a bypass around Canandaigua. Half a mile from the start of the bypass and a short distance before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 meet NY&nbsp;21 at a four-way intersection. Like US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5, NY&nbsp;21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction, but now follows US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 along the east&ndash;west leg of the bypass. Past Bristol Street, the bypass widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US&nbsp;20, NY&nbsp;5 and NY&nbsp;21 meet the southern terminus of NY&nbsp;332. NY&nbsp;21 departs the bypass, following NY&nbsp;332 into downtown, while US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 bypass of Canandaigua. The roadway acts a center of commerce for the city, sporting restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets along its length within the city limits. Upon exiting the city, the establishments become a pair of shopping plazas centered around the intersection with the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;364. Across the town line in Hopewell a quarter-mile to the east, a third plaza, anchored by Runnings, formerly a Walmart, dominates the northeast corner of CR&nbsp;10 and Eastern Boulevard. On the adjacent parcel is another plaza containing the current Walmart. At the entrance to the second plaza, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 intersect Lakeshore Drive, the former routing of US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 to the south of the bypass. Past the junction, the divided highway comes to an end and, after another half-mile, narrows to two lanes. Deeper into Hopewell, the area surrounding US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 become rural once more. Roughly  from the end of the bypass, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 meet NY&nbsp;247. After  of eastward progression through open land, the routes meet the northern terminus of both NY&nbsp;14A and NY&nbsp;245, concurrent at this location, in the town of Geneva. A half-mile past NY&nbsp;14A and NY&nbsp;245, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 enter the city of Geneva and widens into a four lane road. In the city, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 intersect NY&nbsp;14 by way of a pseudo-interchange on the bank of Seneca Lake. US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 turn into a divided highway again at this point. At the interchange, NY&nbsp;14 Truck joins US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5, bypassing a sharp turn on NY&nbsp;14 downtown. US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 continues as a divided highway around the northern tip of Seneca Lake, crossing the Preemption Line and entering Seneca County at its midpoint. A mile to the east in East Geneva, just east of a railroad underpass, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 meet the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;96A at a former trumpet interchange that has been converted to an intersection with a traffic signal.  From NY&nbsp;96A east to the village of Waterloo, a distance of roughly four miles, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 become a two lane road and run parallel to the Cayuga&ndash;Seneca Canal. In Waterloo, the concurrency meets NY&nbsp;96 in the village center. East of the village, the distance between the canal and the roadway decreases, making US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 the closest road to the water for the next one and a half miles to NY&nbsp;414 in the town of Seneca Falls. NY&nbsp;414 joins US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5, overlapping the road for  into the hamlet of Seneca Falls. At Cayuga Street, NY&nbsp;414 turns south, crossing the water body that is the canal and the Seneca River and becoming Ovid Street while US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 turn north onto Cayuga, following the street around the small Van Cleef Lake, through the Finger Lakes Railway grade crossing, and exiting the hamlet. Three miles from NY&nbsp;414, just west of Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 meet NY&nbsp;318 and NY&nbsp;89 at intersections just  apart. The intersection with NY&nbsp;89 has a traffic signal. About three miles (5&nbsp;km) later, after entering Cayuga County over the Seneca River/Cayuga and Seneca Canal, just north of Cayuga Lake, the two routes meet NY&nbsp;90 in the town of Aurelius, at a traffic signal. A few miles east of that intersection, the highway meets the Finger Lakes Railway again, but crosses it via an overpass. The routes continue eastward through Aurelius to the city of Auburn where it turns into a divided four-lane highway again. On the western edge of the city, just after passing Finger Lakes Mall, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5 meet the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;326, which is also a four lane divided highway for a short stretch. In downtown Auburn, US&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;5's east and west lanes split apart from each other for a short distance as an arterial over the alignments of Clark Street, Franklin Street, and Grant Avenue. The arterial runs concurrent with NY&nbsp;38 for . NY&nbsp;38 then splits from the concurrency and joins NY&nbsp;34. A quarter-mile to the east, US&nbsp;20 separates from NY&nbsp;5 at the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;38A. NY&nbsp;5 continues on after the split as the four-lane Grant Avenue passing by a high number of shopping areas. From NY&nbsp;174 in Camillus to Fairmount, NY&nbsp;5 is a  limited-access highway traversing the western suburbs of Syracuse. At one time, the highway was to be extended to West Street in Syracuse, via the current Grand Avenue. The freeway has partial access to NY&nbsp;173 from westbound NY&nbsp;5. East of NY&nbsp;173, the freeway connects to NY&nbsp;695 at a directional T interchange and passes over NY&nbsp;297 without access. East of Fairmount, NY&nbsp;5 alters to the south before turning east onto West Genesee Street and converting to grade-level intersections. In Syracuse, NY&nbsp;5 is parallel to I-690 for much of its routing but never encounters the highway, thus making the north&ndash;south streets that intersect NY&nbsp;5 entry points to and from I-690. In downtown Syracuse, West Genesee Street becomes James Street. At the southern tip of the interchange between I-690 and I-81, NY&nbsp;5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street (US&nbsp;11), but passes under I-81 without access. From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY&nbsp;5 is divided. At the Syracuse&ndash;DeWitt boundary, NY&nbsp;5 intersects NY&nbsp;635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course. Near Shoppingtown Mall, NY&nbsp;5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY&nbsp;92. Less than a mile east of the mall, NY&nbsp;5 and NY&nbsp;92 intersect I-481 at a cloverleaf interchange.  NY&nbsp;5 and NY&nbsp;92 remain concurrent up to Highbridge Road, where NY&nbsp;92 splits from NY&nbsp;5 and heads southeast to Manlius. The segment of the overlap with NY&nbsp;92 between I-481 and the eastern split is the busiest area of NY&nbsp;5 in the Syracuse area and in all of Onondaga County. Past the split, NY&nbsp;5 continues east through Onondaga and Madison counties, passing Fayetteville, Chittenango, and Canastota before entering the vicinity of Oneida. West of the city, NY&nbsp;5 intersects NY&nbsp;365A, a spur route of NY&nbsp;365 leading directly into downtown. To the east, NY&nbsp;5 (which forms the southern boundary of the city) meets NY&nbsp;46 before crossing over Oneida Creek and into Oneida County. Just past the county line in Oneida Castle, NY&nbsp;5 intersects NY&nbsp;365, a route leading northward to the New York State Thruway in Verona. NY&nbsp;5 presses on, passing through the city of Sherrill and the village of Vernon (briefly overlapping NY&nbsp;31) and the town of Westmoreland to the town of Kirkland, where NY&nbsp;5 intersects NY&nbsp;233, crosses over Oriskany Creek, and meets the western terminus of NY&nbsp;5B. The spur of NY&nbsp;5 later rejoins its parent yards from where NY&nbsp;5A departs NY&nbsp;5 to serve western Utica. NY&nbsp;5 itself continues eastward through New Hartford, meeting NY&nbsp;12B prior to merging with NY&nbsp;12 at Genesee Street. Both routes continue eastward across the Sauquoit Creek into Utica.  NY&nbsp;5 enters the city of Utica on a concurrency with NY&nbsp;12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY&nbsp;8, and all three cross the city together. NY&nbsp;5 also intersects with the terminus of NY&nbsp;840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY&nbsp;5, NY&nbsp;8, and NY&nbsp;12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY&nbsp;8 and&nbsp;12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY&nbsp;5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY&nbsp;49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle each side of the Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY&nbsp;5 continues to the end of the expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway, NY&nbsp;5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY&nbsp;5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY&nbsp;28 in the village. After exiting Herkimer, NY&nbsp;5 continues east, closely paralleling this time the canal, through the city of Little Falls as Main Street, where two more concurrencies occur, with NY&nbsp;167 and NY&nbsp;169. NY&nbsp;5 continues to parallel the canal, and in some instances again, the Thruway, through Amsterdam, becoming Amsterdam Road all the way to Scotia, where it crosses the canal into Schenectady as Mohawk Avenue, turning into State Street upon entering the city limits. It continues fairly straight on a southeast course into Albany as Central Avenue until it reaches Townsend Park. At this point, NY&nbsp;5 turns into Washington Avenue and all signage referring to NY&nbsp;5 ceases. The New York State Department of Transportation recognizes the route, however, as it continues down Washington Ave past the New York State Capitol building, turning south for a short distance as Eagle Street. NY&nbsp;5 then continues east on State Street to Broadway, where it again turns south east shortly before returning east on a small spur of Broadway, traveling underneath US&nbsp;9 and I-787. NY&nbsp;5 ends at the Hudson River. Soon after the end of the American Revolution in 1783, a surge of westward migration into Central and Western New York began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois trail that was a simple foot path. By the late 1780s many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York. As a result, there was a clamor for the building of a main road running west from Utica.  On March&nbsp;22, 1794, the New York State Legislature passed a law calling for the laying out and improvement of a public road from old Fort Schuyler on the Mohawk River to the settlement of Canawaugus on the Genesee River, in as straight a line as the topography of the land would allow. This road was officially known as the "Great Genesee Road" and is one of the earliest state roads in New York, intended to provide access to the New Military Tract. As planned, it generally followed the old Iroquois trail through Oneida, Manlius, Onondaga Valley (south of modern Syracuse), Skaneateles, Auburn, Seneca Falls, Geneva, and Canandaigua before ending at the Genesee River. Four years later, another legislative act authorized the extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo. By the end of the 18th century, while the Genesee Road had been greatly improved and saw heavy traffic, many portions were still substandard and some sections had still not been completed. Partly because of this, and also because of the success of the Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania, the state outsourced the task of improving and maintaining the Genesee Road to a private company. On April&nbsp;1, 1800, the Seneca Road Company was chartered for this purpose and the portion of the Genesee Road from Utica to Canandaigua was improved and operated as a toll road known as the Seneca Turnpike, which was  long and, at the time, the longest turnpike in the state. Three days later, the old road following the Mohawk River between Utica and Schenectady also became a turnpike, known as the Mohawk Turnpike. With the road leading from Albany northwest to Schenectady having been already established as a turnpike (the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike) in 1797, an all-turnpike route over good quality roads was now available from Albany to Canandaigua. The western extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo soon followed suit and also became an improved Macadam toll road, the Ontario and Genesee Turnpike, in 1805. The Seneca Road Company was authorized to create a more northerly alternate route of the Seneca Turnpike in 1806. This branch left the original turnpike east of Seneca Falls and crossed more level terrain through Elbridge, Geddes, and Fayetteville before rejoining the old path at Chittenango. As the city of Syracuse developed, traffic patterns changed and the northern branch route became more heavily used than the original road. The construction and opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 along the same alignment as the Albany to Buffalo route began to eat away at the revenues of these turnpike companies. In time, the turnpike business had become unprofitable and the companies were dissolved by 1852, causing the roads to revert to public control. The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852. The old, southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus, NY&nbsp;175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill, and NY&nbsp;173 from there east to Chittenango. The improvement of the road from Buffalo southwest to Pennsylvania in the mid-19th century soon allowed for continuous travel across the entire state of New York. With the advent of the automobile, the state began to take over and pave major thoroughfares at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1908, the state legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes. One of the routes assigned at this time was Route&nbsp;6, an Albany–Buffalo highway that followed the path of the Genesee Road and the Seneca Turnpike from Buffalo to Utica, the Mohawk Turnpike between Utica and Schenectady, and the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike from Schenectady to Albany. From Auburn to Chittenango, Route&nbsp;6 utilized most of the newer, northern branch of the Seneca Turnpike.  The automobile allowed people to quickly travel long distances and a way to mark routes became needed. One early means of marking routes was the establishment of various auto trail associations in the 1910s. These associations selected good quality roads and marked them with symbols or colors on telephone poles. Most of legislative Route&nbsp;6 eventually became part of the Yellowstone Trail, a cross-country auto trail established in 1912 that ran from Washington to Massachusetts. In New York, the trail used modern US&nbsp;20 from Pennsylvania to Silver Creek, most of modern NY&nbsp;5 from Silver Creek to Albany, and modern US&nbsp;20 again from Albany to Massachusetts. In 1924, following what other states did, New York began to assign route numbers to its main thoroughfares. The Albany to Buffalo portion of the Yellowstone Trail, which ran through the cities of Syracuse and Utica, was assigned the number NY&nbsp;5A. The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY&nbsp;5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY&nbsp;5's original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany. In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY&nbsp;5 and NY&nbsp;5A overlapped. By 1926, however, the Buffalo to Albany section of NY&nbsp;5 was relocated onto the Genesee Road alignment, replacing NY&nbsp;5A. NY&nbsp;5's former, more southerly alignment was redesignated as NY&nbsp;7. In 1927, the establishment of the U.S. Highway System created more numbering changes. US&nbsp;20, which mainly followed the Yellowstone Trail elsewhere in the country, was designated in New York along NY&nbsp;5 southwest of Hamburg and east of Albany and along old NY&nbsp;7 from Skaneateles to Albany. Between the towns of Hamburg and Avon, the new US&nbsp;20 used an even more southerly alignment, running via East Aurora and Warsaw. This truncated both ends of NY&nbsp;5 to Athol Springs (south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg) in the west, and to Albany in the east. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. In the 1930 state highway renumbering, NY&nbsp;5 was truncated even further to begin in downtown Buffalo. The portion between Buffalo and Athol Springs was assigned as part of NY&nbsp;62.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930–31 and 1931–32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930–31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering Southwest of Buffalo, Southwestern Boulevard, an alternate route of US&nbsp;20 between Irving and Big Tree (east of Athol Springs) became NY&nbsp;20B. Further southwest, another alternate route of US&nbsp;20 between the Pennsylvania line and Silver Creek, running along the shore of Lake Erie, was designated as NY&nbsp;20A. The NY&nbsp;20A and NY&nbsp;20B designations proved to be short-lived. US&nbsp;62 was extended into New York , causing NY&nbsp;62 to be renumbered. Around the same time, US&nbsp;20 was realigned to follow NY&nbsp;20B from Irving to Big Tree. NY&nbsp;5 was extended along part of old NY&nbsp;62 to Athol Springs, from where it continued to the Pennsylvania state line by way of US&nbsp;20's old routing to Irving and all of NY&nbsp;20A. Originally, NY&nbsp;5 entered Buffalo from the south on Fuhrmann Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and followed South Park Avenue and Main Street through the city before rejoining its modern alignment at Goodell Street. In the mid-1950s, a new limited-access highway was constructed along Fuhrmann Boulevard from Lackawanna to the Buffalo River. At the river, the new roadway broke from Fuhrmann and continued directly into downtown, returning to grade level two blocks south of Niagara Square. The expressway, known as the Buffalo Skyway, became part of a rerouted NY&nbsp;5 by 1956. Visually, the Skyway cuts off the city from the Buffalo inner harbor. In 2008, there was momentum to tear it down, but the momentum has passed.  Farther east in Utica, construction began in the early 1950s on a new arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through the city center. The new roadway bypassed NY&nbsp;5, which was initially routed on Genesee Street and Herkimer Road through Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment north of River Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY&nbsp;5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964, at which time it became part of a rerouted NY&nbsp;5 and NY&nbsp;12. Two portions of Genesee Street, from NY&nbsp;12 in New Hartford to the Utica city line and from NY&nbsp;5S to Herkimer Road in Utica, remain state maintained to this day as unsigned NY&nbsp;921E and NY&nbsp;921C, respectively. In the Syracuse suburbs of Camillus and Geddes, NY&nbsp;5 was initially routed on West Genesee Street between the villages of Camillus and Solvay. Construction on a bypass of this segment of NY&nbsp;5 began in the early 1970s and was completed between NY&nbsp;695 and Genesee Street by 1977. By the following year, the freeway was open to traffic up to Hinsdale Road; however, NY&nbsp;5 remained on Genesee Street between Hinsdale and the Solvay village limits. The remainder of the Camillus Bypass was completed , at which time NY&nbsp;5 was realigned to follow the freeway. Genesee Street is now largely maintained by Onondaga County as CR&nbsp;98; however, two portions of the street remain state maintained. Near the western end of the expressway, the former routing of NY&nbsp;5 became part of an extended NY&nbsp;174. Between the Camillus town line and the eastern end of the bypass, Genesee Street is unsigned NY&nbsp;930W.  Smaller realignments also took place in other cities along the route. In Canandaigua, NY&nbsp;5 originally entered the city on West Avenue and followed South Main Street and Lakeshore Drive through the city limits before rejoining its current routing in Hopewell. In the mid-1950s, a new bypass was built north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell. It became part of a realigned NY&nbsp;5 by 1956. The remainder of the bypass around the southwestern extents of the city was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The former routing of NY&nbsp;5 on South Main Street remains state maintained as NY&nbsp;942T; until 1996, the portion of West Avenue between the west end of the bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as NY&nbsp;942W. Even though maintenance of the road had been transferred to the town of Canandaigua in 1996, the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007. In Geneva, NY&nbsp;5 was initially routed on East North Street and Border City Road, overlapping NY&nbsp;14 through the city and rejoining its modern routing in East Geneva. The overlap was eliminated  when NY&nbsp;5 was moved onto a new roadway located along the edge of Seneca Lake. NY&nbsp;5 was realigned again in the 1960s to use a new divided highway built midway between the lake shore road and Border City Road. Border City Road is now maintained by Seneca County as CR&nbsp;110. NY&nbsp;5 has three suffixed routes, all located in Oneida County, with NY&nbsp;5S extending eastward into three other counties. The NY&nbsp;5A designation was also used for two other routes.                                                                                                                               The NY&nbsp;5A designation has been used for three distinct highways: The first NY&nbsp;5A was a short-lived designation for the portion of modern NY&nbsp;5 east of Buffalo. When it existed from 1924 to the mid-1920s, NY&nbsp;5 was routed on what is now US&nbsp;20. The second NY&nbsp;5A was a northerly alternate route of NY&nbsp;5 between Aurelius and Sennett in Cayuga County. It was assigned  and renumbered to NY&nbsp;135 . That route was removed . Its former routing is now maintained by Cayuga County as CR&nbsp;10A, CR&nbsp;10B, and CR&nbsp;10C. The current NY&nbsp;5A () is a short alternate route of NY&nbsp;5 between New Hartford and downtown Utica in Oneida County. It was assigned in the mid-1930s. NY&nbsp;5B () is a short alternate route southwest of Utica in Oneida County, connecting NY&nbsp;5 to NY&nbsp;12B. The route was assigned in the 1930s. NY&nbsp;5S () is an alternate route of NY&nbsp;5 on the south side of the Mohawk River between Utica, Oneida County, and Rotterdam, Schenectady County. The route parallels NY&nbsp;5 (which follows the north side of the river) and is partially a limited-access highway. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.
