Albacete is the most important city in Castile-La Mancha, regional economic engine of reference in Spain, economic and judicial capital of the autonomous community, home to the High Court of Justice of Castilla-La Mancha, the highest court of the region. The writer, novelist, essayist and literary critic Azorin described the city of Albacete in a poem as "The New York of La Mancha". The origins of the city are uncertain, although the first certainties of existence are in the domain andalus area, having originally been called the city as البسيط Al-Basit, in Arabic "El Llano" in reference to planiform nature of geography. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the city began gaining importance as, during the Spanish Civil War, it was the headquarters of the International Brigades. At present, Albacete is a modern capital with large areas for pedestrians and green areas. Further its flat area and the elimination of architectural barriers have also led it to be one of the most accessible cities across the country, with better quality of life and one of the safest. The entertainment is one of the hallmarks of the capital of Albacete, with large areas of party as La Zona, El Campus or Los Titis hosting thousands of albaceteños and visitors throughout the year, highlighting their hectic and very active day and night life by enjoying famous throughout Spain. Other of its attractions in this regard are the traditional Tascas de la Feria or the castizo outdoor market of Los Invasores. Albacete is a commercial and industrial city par excellence, reflected in its extensive commercial area that includes more than 556&nbsp;723 people from 154 municipalities. Its privileged location, halfway between Madrid and Mediterranean coast, makes it the main logistical hub and communications Southeast Spain, with great connections by motorways and by rail (including services AVE) and air through your airport which connects points of the Spanish geography. The city has many festivals and traditions, among which we would highlight the Feria de Albacete, declared International Tourist Interest, which is held from September 7 to 17 in honor of the Virgin of Los Llanos, the Fiestas de San Juan de Albacete, the Albacete Easter or Carnival Albacete, as well as numerous events of regional, national and international character like International FIM CEV Championship in Circuito de Albacete, the International Circus Festival, the International Film Festival Abycine, the Biennial of Art City of Albacete, the National Theatre Awards Pepe Isbert, AB Fashion Day, the Fair Performing Arts Castilla-La Mancha or Expovicaman, among many others, and even trade fairs and exhibitions. The industry is one of the pillars of the city. Albacete is home to major multinationals and has five large industrial zones, including Campollano, which is the largest industrial area of Castile-La Mancha and one of the largest in Spain. Higher education and research are another major development areas of the city, highlighting the University of Castile-La Mancha, the Biomedical Campus of Albacete and the Technology Park of Albacete. The aviation industry is one of the main economic engines of the city. Albacete hosts the School of TLP NATO pilots, Los Llanos Air Base, Ala 14 and the Air Maestranza Albacete, the most important of Spain. In addition, the city houses the Air and Logistic Park of Albacete, home to major companies. The toponym of "Albacete" is derived from the Andalusian name for the area, the city having been originally called البسيط Al-Basit, in Arabic, which translates to "the plain" in reference to the plateau that characterizes the geography of the area. Pascual Madoz in his famous  Diccionario geográfico-estadístico-histórico de España y sus posesiones de Ultramar (Geographical-historical-statistical Dictionary of Spain and its overseas territories) indicates that two hypotheses about the toponym of Albacete are probable. In the first place he highlights the proposal suggested by Bernardo Espinalt y Garcia, who believes that the city was founded by the Cilicians, who called it "Celtide" relying on Liutprando de Cremona, "in Hispaniam venientes Celtide vocaverunt hunc locum, quem vocan Albacene corrupte mauri (in Spain this place is called Celtide, which the Moors called Albacene incorrectly)". The second hypothesis states that its origin may be the "Alaba" of the Celtiberians, mentioned by Plinio y Ptolemy, which could result in "Alba civitas", which later became Albacete. The most common adjective used to describe the inhabitants of the town of Albacete is albacetense or, albaceteño/a, without prejudice to the demonyms used for the inhabitants of the various population centers that make up the area such as the aguanueveros (inhabitants of Agua Nuevo) or colonos for the neighboring Aguas Nuevas inhabitants (among others).  According to a resolution adopted by the Plenary Council, in a session held on February 28, 1986, the shield of Albacete is described as follows: "The city of Albacete has as its shield: three towers neatly arranged on a silver background with battlements, of stone, saber embroidered in azure, clarified and surmounted by a saber-bat with outstretched wings positioned at the top. It is stamped with a Marquis crown, which is gold with stones and pearls, with eight rosettes (four numbered and the other in pyramids of three pearls, one is visible with two halves of the first kind and intercroppings of the second two)." But the agreement contained a typo, and saying "three towers well ordered", which heraldically would mean two towers above and one below. on being one above and two below, the descriptions should read "three towers wrongly ordered." Later the Official Journal of Castilla-La Mancha published on January 13, 1987, Decree 137/86 of December 30, from the Presidency and Government of the Community Board, which approved the amendment of the Heraldic Shield of the City of Albacete, without making corrections to the description of the ordering of the towers.  According to the resolution adopted by the City Council plenary in a session dated April 30, 1992, the City Council acknowledged the Order of the Ministry of Public Administration, dated March 9 of that year, through which the municipality of Albacete was granted a flag, with the following description: "crimson red canvas, dimensions  with the Albacete Shield encamped in the center, according to the amendment by Decree 137/86 of 30 December. The dimensions of the Shield are  high, excluding the Crown and  if included, with a width of  ". The anthem was launched on September 8, 1926, day of the Virgin of Los Llanos (patron saint of the city), in what was referred to as the "Provincial Anthem feast", which took place at the Plaza de Toros in the Albacete capital. The Municipal Band of Albacete and Spanish Infantry Regiment, among others, performed at this event. On the night of San Juan in 1975 (day of the patron of the city), the song was re-released at the Teatro Circo de Albacete by the Albacete Municipal Band and the La Mancha Choir, becoming a hallmark of the capital.   The nineteenth century marked the development of the city, given that in 1833 the province of Albacete had been created with territories from the former territories of Cuenca, Murcia and La Mancha, Albacete being accorded the rank of capital. The following year, in 1834 the Albacete Court was established to exercise jurisdiction over a large territory that comprised the provinces of Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Murcia and the aforementioned Albacete, and which would be the antecedent to the current legal capital of Castilla-La Mancha after the adoption of autonomous state in the last quarter of the twentieth century, the city being the seat of the High Court of Justice of Castilla-La Mancha, according to article 23 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Community. Albacete is home to the High Court of Justice of Castilla-La Mancha (TSJCLM), the highest court of the autonomous region. The president of the Superior Court is Vicente Manuel Rouco Rodríguez, which is the highest representative of judiciary to Castile-La Mancha. The High Court, established in 1989, based on the Palace of Justice in Albacete, is divided into three rooms: the Chamber of Civil and Criminal, the Board of Administrative Litigation and the Room social. The city also hosts the Institute of Legal Medicine of Albacete, Cuenca and Guadalajara, whose scope corresponds to homonymous provinces. Moreover, the Manchego capital is the seat of Bar Council of Castilla-La Mancha and Notary Association of Castilla-La Mancha. The long legal tradition of Albacete goes back to 1834, when the Territorial Court of Albacete (predecessor of the High Court), which extended its jurisdiction over the provinces of Albacete was created Ciudad Real and Cuenca and the Murcia. The city also has a Provincial Court and head judicial district of Albacete, the judicial No. 1 province, whose demarcation comprises the city and over 15 municipalities, mainly of metropolitan area, which adds a Dean. The legal infrastructure is completed by two courts Administrative Litigation three trial courts, juvenile court, one for violence against women, three of Criminal Seven of First Instance, three social courts. In this sense we must bear in mind that the Autonomous Community of Castile La Mancha does not exercise the powers in justice. All courts of the city unless the Superior Court of Castilla-La Mancha will be based in the new City of Justice in Albacete. In addition, on the outskirts of the city is the Albacete Prison, known as The Prison Torrecica, established in 1981, and the Center for Children Albaidel, born in 1993. The city of Albacete is first order concerning military and defense facilities, housing important institutions nationally and internationally as the Pilot School TLP NATO, Los Llanos Air Base, 14 Wing's or Air Arsenal Albacete, generating thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. Also, very close to it is situated the National Training Center Chinchilla, linked to the city. The TLP (Tactical Leadership Programme officially) is an international center for advanced training for pilots and crews in order to improve the operability and effectiveness of Allied Air Forces. In addition to the workshops flight (both day and night), theoretical courses for staff of the three armies of both countries outside NATO and the Alliance has also developed, and assists in the development of air doctrine. It has a permanent staff of over 100 people of all member countries and their courses involve the deployment of 3,000 troops a year in the city. It has received an investment of over 32 million in recent years in infrastructure and equipment in Albacete.  The Los Llanos Air Base of Los Llanos is a major air bases in Spain, which is deployed Wing 14 and the most advanced aircraft of the Air Force, like the Eurofighter Typhoon, one of the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world . It is a small town where they work more than 1000 people. Wing 14 is one of the military units of the Air Force of Spain. Equipped with, among others, the Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft, whose main function is carrying out air missions. It has two squadrons: 141 Squadron and 142 Squadron. Albacete's Air Arsenal is the most important of Spain. Its mission is the maintenance of aircraft of the Air Force at the highest level. Its facilities occupy an area of over 470,000 square meters. It has more than 600 workers. Linked to the city is the National Training Center Chinchilla Army of Spain, located east of the capital, in the neighboring town of Chinchilla de Montearagón. The center, which includes a complex set of facilities and means of simulation, training serves three armies military personnel as well as the Forces of State Security. It is one of the two National Training Centres of Spain.  The origins of the city are uncertain, although the first few confirmations of its existence are found during the Moorish domination of the area. The earliest documentation is from 1269, when Albacete was only a small village, dependent on the borough of Chinchilla. Before that, it had been a small Moorish village. Its name is derived from the Arabic  , "El Llano" ("the plain") referring to the planiform nature of the geography of the area.. It was taken by Christian troops in 1241 and was under the dominion of Alarcon. Around the first third of the 14th century, in the time of the famous writer Don Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, who was the governor of Murcia and, therefore the Lord of these lands, which were to become later the Marquisate of Villena, the village began to develop and its population to increase. In 1375 it was considered a borough and became independent of Chinchilla, and a century later, in 1476, the Catholic Monarchs rewarded Albacete for supporting the Crown by granting it a licence to hold a market once a week. During the Revolt of the Comuneros (1520–22), after initial protests, Albacete supported the new emperor Charles V who, in 1526, granted the feudal estate of the town to his wife, the Empress Isabella of Portugal. During this period, building started on the church of San Juan Bautista (St John the Baptist), which was later to become a cathedral.   Albacete is located in a strategic position between Madrid and the east coast of Spain and its agricultural wealth led to the growth of the borough during the next few centuries until Philip V granted permission for an annual fair (1710). This fair was later held in an enclosure built by Charles III (1783).  The railway reached Albacete in 1855, and the Madrid‑Alicante route passed through the town. Later, Albacete was also connected by rail to Cartagena. In 1862, Isabel II granted Albacete the title of town. Street electric lighting was inaugurated in 1888, thus being the first capital of a province in Spain with electric lighting in its streets. Throughout the 19th century, the population of the town doubled from the 10,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the century to around 21,000 by the beginning of the 20th century. During this period, Albacete defended Queen Isabel II against the Carlists (the supporters of Charles, the pretender to the Spanish throne), supported Espartero and, just like other Spanish cities, constituted a revolutionary junta. During the long period of the Restoration (1875–1923), symptoms of caciquismo (or "boss politics," a system of dominance by a local party leader) invaded the political and social life of Albacete. Between 1900 and the end of the Spanish Civil War (1939), the population tripled. A number of basic public works date back to that time: the water supply and sewer system (1905), the Abelardo Sanchez Park (1910–23), Tesifonte Gallego Street and the Industrial area of the town. During the Spanish Civil War (1935–39), after a brief lapse in the power of the troops who had rebelled against the Republican government, the town fell back into the hands of Madrid. For most of the war, the airbase at Los Llanos was the main headquarters of the Republican air force. It was also the headquarters of the International Brigades (supporters of the Republican cause from other countries who fought in the Spanish Civil war) and a monument has been built recently to commemorate the sixty years' anniversary of those events. The first volume of Peter Weiss' novel The Aesthetics of Resistance is located in Albacete's Civil War days hospital "Cueva La Potita". In the time of the transition to democracy, the two most significant events were the establishment in Albacete in 1982 of the High Court of Justice of Castile-La Mancha, Casa de Quevedo, and the consolidation of the University, which brought new life to the town in 1985. Albacete has become the most important town in the Castile-la Mancha region, with unparalleled services and industrial activity, due to its position on the excellent train and highway communications that link Madrid to the eastern coast of Spain. The university has 10,000 students that feed a lot of clubs, bars and tapas restaurants. During summer nights, thousands of people visit Tascas de la Feria to eat regional dishes. In September, the Feria de Albacete (town festival) transforms the city for ten days. A great many visitors fill the city streets, and the population increases fivefold.
