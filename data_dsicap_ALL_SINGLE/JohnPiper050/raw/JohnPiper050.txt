   May 9, 1982 (Morning)    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor               LISTEN TO THE EYEWITNESS OF HIS MAJESTY     (2 Peter 1:12-19)              In what we have seen so far in 2 Peter (up through 1:11) the main point has been to urge     Christians to make sure that they are truly saved. Verse 10 says, Therefore, brethren, be     more zealous to confirm your call and election. Peter is aware of people who have made a     kind of start in the life of faith and obedience, but who have then quit growing and drifted away     into destruction (2:20). He does not want that to happen to us. So he tells us how to make     sure that we are among God's elect who are called to his own glory and excellence (v.3).     The way to confirm your call and election is to stand firm in your faith and to advance in virtue,     knowledge, self-control, patience, godliness, brotherly affection and love. These are the things     that certify the genuineness of your faith and confirm the reality of your conversion. If you have     them and are growing in them you will never fall or be fruitless (vv. 8,10).         That's the main point so far: Confirm your election by pressing on in all the obedience of faith.     But there is a subordinate point just as important as this one, namely, God's divine power     has already given us all things which lead to life and godliness (v.3). All our efforts to press     on to the goal of perfect love are possible only because God has already given us the power of     his Spirit. We do not work to earn his favor. We work by the power of his favor which has gone     before all our labor. And, what's more, his power always flows into us when we trust his     precious and very great promises (v.4). Therefore, when the power of God enables us to obey     Christ, it always does so through faith in God's promises. And that means that the obedience     which confirms our election is the obedience that comes from faith. We do not secure our     lives by trying to merit the grace of God through works of the law. We secure our lives by     trusting in the gracious promises so much that we desire nothing more than to love people the     way God does. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love (1 John 4:8).         Today we will follow Peter's thought on through verse 19. So let's walk through the text and     apply it to our lives as we go. Verses 12-15:          Therefore I intend always to remind you of these things, though you know them and are       established in the truth that you have. I think it right, as long as I am in the body, to       arouse you by way of reminder, since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon,       as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. And I will see to it that after my departure you may       be able at any time to recall these things.          I see four steps in Peter's thinking here and I'll mention them, not in the order they come in     the text, but in their order from the most basic observations up to the conclusions he draws for     his own action.         First, in verse 12 he observes that the things he is writing about are already known. His     readers are well grounded and established in the truth. Do you remember that just before     Peter denied Christ three times Jesus said to him (in Luke 22:32) When you have turned     again establish your brethren. This is the same word used here in 2 Peter 1:12. His readers     are established, perhaps by Peter's own ministry (cf. v.16). Therefore if we consider ourselves     at Bethlehem established in the truth of God, let us take heed. This letter is for us. It's not just     for beginners.         Second, in verse 14 the Lord is almost ready to take Peter away from his body. I know that     the putting off of my body will be soon as the Lord Jesus Christ has showed me. His death is     near. The Lord has shown him it will not be long. This has two clear and comforting     implications for us whose calling and election are sure. It implies that when we die we go to     be with the Lord. The words Peter uses in verse 14 imply that the body is like a tent or a     garment and that death means we lay the garment aside for a while and leave. As Paul said in     2 Corinthians 5:8, We would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. We     should all take courage as this old fleshly garment wears out. We will not go with it to     corruption. The second comforting implication of verse 14 is that the death of a believer is     never accidental from God's perspective. You recall from John 21:18,19 how Jesus predicted     the way Peter would die by crucifixion. Now here Peter says the Lord has told him when -- not     long. The reason the Lord knows when and how Peter will die is because he is in control of     the world. God could send an angel to let Peter escape when he is imprisoned in Rome. He     did that in Acts 12:6-11. But he is not going to do that. Peter will die, crucified upside down,     according to tradition. But neither he, nor his precious friends who were reading this letter, nor     we should waver thinking that evil has the upper hand. God's hand is always the upper hand.     No matter how tragic the death of a believer seems to us, God has universal perspective and     does all things well. My father captured this thought perfectly in a poem he wrote this Mother's     Day in memory of my mother, who was killed in a bus accident.         A SHORT POEM OF MOTHER IN PRAISE OF MEMORY          Though now the pain has long since ceased      The mysteries remain      How one so full of life and joy      Could suddenly be slain.      How easily the heart cries, Why?      Why, Lord; why not me?      The purpose of his sovereign will      Is difficult to see.             Yet, in the shadow of his wings      One feels the love and care      That mend the wounded, broken heart      And shatters grim despair.          Bill Piper    5-9-82         The third step now is in verse 13. Since the readers are already established in the truth, and     since Peter's time is short on earth, Peter thinks that the right thing to do is spend his     remaining time arousing their memory of these things. If the Lord told you this afternoon that     your time is short, what would you devote yourself to? Peter answers: I am going to devote     myself to increasing the lively memory of Christian truth. He is convinced that if he can keep     the greatness of Christ's work and promises in the memory, believers will be awakened and     aroused to hope in those promises and be diligent to grow in godliness and thus confirm their     call and election.         Do you see what this means for us at Bethlehem? It means that even we who know the truth     and are established in it need repeated reminders of its greatness lest we fall asleep or forget     (cf. v.9). We must get out of our heads the notion that our eternal security is mechanical or     automatic. God is faithful and will preserve his children from stumbling (1 Thess. 5:24; Rom.     8:29ff); but the way he does this is personal and living and dynamic and involves real     interaction between the saints and Christ. God uses reminders to rouse us from the slumbers     of indifference. We prove the genuineness of our salvation by availing ourselves of these     reminders and being stirred up to add to our faith virtue and knowledge and patience and     godliness and brotherly affection and love. Peter regards these believers who are established     in the truth as people in great need of rousing reminders. If we need one day a year to arouse     and awaken us to the tremendous value of our mothers whom we have seen, it is not     surprising that we need weekly and even daily reminders that the promises of God are     infinitely more valuable than the dearest relation on earth.         The fourth step in Peter's thinking takes the third one just a bit further in verse 15. Since he     thinks it right to devote the rest of his few months on earth to the ministry of reminding, he     resolves to leave behind a letter that will go on reminding the church of these things until     Jesus comes. I will see to it that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall     these things. The reason a Christian should write a last will and testament is to see to it that     what he has accumulated and learned will be put to use for Christ's sake when he is gone.     This letter is Peter's last will and testament. It's as if he were reliving that day at the Temple     gate in Jerusalem when he said to the cripple, Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I     give to you (Acts 3:6). He still didn't have any silver to will to anyone, but what he had was     infinitely more valuable and that he wills to the church: an authoritative reminder of the     precious and very great promise that Christ is coming again. I think if Peter could see us now     he would be delighted that his letter was preserved in Scripture and that 1900 years later he is     still reminding and arousing the saints to confirm our call and election.         So we see four steps in verses 12-15: first, Peter is concerned about people who know the     truth and are established in it; second, his days are numbered -- according to God's plan;     third, established believers need repeated reminders about how great and precious God's     promises are; fourth, Peter gives us this letter as his last will and testament. His bequest to     the church is not money, but a reminder of Christ's power and his glorious second coming.         Now in verse 16 he tells us why this reminder is so weighty. For we did not follow cleverly     devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,     but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. In other words, the reason my reminder about the     precious and very great promises of God (which are all summed up in Christ's second coming)     -- the reason my word to you is so weighty -- is because it is not based on a myth but on an     eyewitness account of Christ's majesty.          There are three important observations to make here. First, the word coming in verse 16     does refer to Christ's second coming, not just his first coming. The Greek word parousia refers     to the second coming 18 times in the New Testament and never to the first coming. The same     word is used in 2 Peter 3:4 and 12 where it certainly refers to his future coming. Second, the     power and coming of Christ were part of Peter's earlier teaching to these people. Verse 16     says he had already made it known. This is not peripheral doctrine tacked on at the end; it     is essential. Christ has all power and authority and he is coming. One of the marks of a living     evangelical faith is that we reckon seriously, earnestly and joyfully with the personal, visible     return of the God-Man Jesus Christ. The second coming is at the heart of our faith and our     confidence in it should be the faith of our heart. We should long for it.         And the third observation from verse 16 is that confidence in Christ's future coming in power is     based, not on a myth, but on an eyewitness experience of his majesty in the past. The     difference between mythical speculations and Christian faith is history. Our doctrines are not     the result of clever head-work. They are the result of historical observation. This is why     knowledge plays such a crucial role for Peter. Notice verse 2: Grace be multiplied to you in     the knowledge of God. Verse 3: His divine power has been given to us … through     knowledge. Verse 5: Make every effort to add to your virtue knowledge. Verse 8: If you     have these things you will not be unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (see     also 2:20; 3:18). Full-blooded Christian faith does not flourish in ignorance. Sects flourish in     ignorance. Two things have always followed in the wake of Christian missions: hospitals and     schools. If our faith is not grounded in reliable observations of historical reality, it is a cleverly     devised myth and unworthy of acceptance.         Now in verses 17 and 18 Peter tells us in particular what historical event has given him such     confidence in Christ's power and second coming, namely, his eyewitness experience with     James and John on the mount of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-8; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36). You     recall from the gospel accounts how they went up to pray with Jesus and he was transfigured     before them in great light and glory and then from the overshadowing cloud God spoke of his     Son. Peter describes the event in verses 17 and 18 like this: For when Jesus received honor     and glory from God the Father and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, 'This is     my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased,' we heard his voice borne from heaven, for we     were with him on the holy mountain. We were there, we heard the voice, we saw the glory.     And so we now know with what power and glory and authority Jesus will return. The     eyewitness experience of Jesus' transfiguration was a preview of the glory of the second     coming of Christ.         Peter could have told how he saw Christ after his resurrection or how he saw him ascend into     heaven. But in neither of these did Jesus appear in his majesty as verse 16 says. And it is the     majesty and the greatness of his coming that Peter wants to remind us of. Recall that in verse     4 he refers to precious and very great (or magnificent) promises. Thirty years after the event     the revelation of the majesty of Christ fills the mind of Peter with awe and he wants more than     anything to share the hope of that vision with us before he dies.         And so in verse 19 he emphasizes again that the word about Christ's coming is sure, and then     he calls us to give heed to it until the end. We have the prophetic word made more sure. You     will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns     and the morning star rises in your hearts. Peter calls the word of Christ's coming a prophetic     word because the glorious coming of the Messiah is predicted in the Old Testament prophets     (e.g. Mal. 4:2; Is. 60:1). And he speaks of it as more sure now because it has been     confirmed on the mount of transfiguration in an eyewitness preview of its fulfillment.         And so in the last half of verse 19 Peter returns to his admonition in verses 12-15. There the     point was that all Christians need to be reminded repeatedly of the precious and very great     promises. Here the point is that all Christians need to pay attention to the prophetic word. And     he uses a picture to show us the urgency of his admonition. It is night time. The world is     covered with the darkness of sin and deceit and fear and greed (cf. Col. 1:13). Everyone who     inhabits this age of darkness is in danger of stumbling over some unexpected temptation or     falsehood. Our only hope to survive the night is to have a lamp going before us. And Peter     says the prophetic word, the promise of Christ's coming, is that lamp. And he pleads with us:     keep your eyes on it; don't fall asleep; don't turn away after some bewitching song in the     night. The hope of the coming of Jesus Christ is the lamp to our feet and a light to our path in     a very dark world.         For two weeks I have said, put in front of you the carrot or the hot fudge sundae of God's     promises, and let it lure you on in paths of righteousness into eternal life. Now I can change     the image and let Peter say the same thing. Hang in front of you the lamp of the promise of     Christ's glorious coming and let it guide you through the night, away from every temptation to     sin, until the dawn. Everyone who thus hopes in Christ purifies himself as he is pure (1 John     3:3). The power of God for godliness flows in the channel of his promise.          And what is the hope that lures us on to walk in the light as he is in the light? Two things:     dawn without and daystar within. The lamp will shine until the day dawns and the morning     star rises in your hearts. His glory shall appear and cover the earth like the waters cover the     sea. And we shall be like him. In Revelation 22:16 Jesus says, I am the bright and morning     star. And in Revelation 2:28 he promises, To him who conquers and keeps my works unto     the end … I will give him the bright and morning star. The light will rise over the world and the     light will rise in our hearts. There will be glory without and glory within.          Is bright the sun that you behold?      Then let imagination fly,      And multiply ten-thousand fold,      Then let the answer fill the sky.      The Lord Majestic will return      Ten-thousand brilliant suns ablaze,      And in my heart a star will burn      With endless worship in its rays.          JP 5/82          The whole creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God       (Rom. 8:19).           The righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father       (Matt. 13:43).          If these things are so, what manner of persons ought we to be in all hope and joy and     godliness!          © COPYRIGHT John Piper
