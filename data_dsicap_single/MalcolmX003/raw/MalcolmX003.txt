H EADS O F STATE

Throughout June, 1 964, Malcolm X spoke, agitated,

educated and organized to create a new,   non-religious movement to promote black unity and work for freedom "by any means necessary. " On June 28, this new movement was born under the name of the Organization of Afro­ American Unity, its "statement of basic aims and objec­ tives"   was   released   to   the public,   and Malcolm was designated chairman.

Shortly thereafter, on July 9, Malcolm again left the

United   States for Africa and the Middle East. His im­ mediate objective was to attend the "African Summit"­ the second meeting of the Organization of African Unity, which had been formed in 1 963 to bring about joint

action by the independent African governments.

The OA U conference was held in Cairo July 1 7-21,

and was attended by nearly all the heads of the thirty­ four member states.   The welcom ing address was made

by President   Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United   � rab

Republic who, while reViewing the events of the prevlOus year, hailed the Civil Rights Act of 1 964 that had recently

been enacted in the United States.

Malcolm was accepted as an observer at the confer­ ence. In this capacity he was permitted to submit to the delegates an eight-page memorandum urging their support of the Negro struggle in the United States and their help in bringing the plight of the American Negro before the United Nations.   The memorandum, which follows, was delivered to the delegates on July 1 7, one day before the

events that came to be called "the Harlem riots. "

Your Excellencies:

The   Organization of Afro-American Unity has sent me to attend this historic African summit conference as

An Appeal to African Heads of State                     73 an observer to represent the interests of 2 2 million African­ Americans whose human rights are being violated daily by the r acism of American imperialists.

The   Organization of Afro-American Unity ( OAA U ) h a s been formed b y a cross-section of America's African­ American community, and is p atterned after the letter and spirit of the Organization of African Unity ( OA U). Just as the Organization of African Unity has called upon all Africa n leaders to submerge their differences and u nite o n common objectives for the common good of all Africans - in America the Organization of Afro-America n

Unity h a s called upon Afro-American leaders to sub   � erge

their differences and find areas of agreement wherem we can work in unity for the good of the entire 22 million African-Americans.

Since the 22 million of us were originally Mricans � who are now in America not by choice but only by a cruel   accident in   our history. we strongly believe that African problems are our problems and our problems are Africa n problems.

Your Excellencies:

We also   believe that as   heads   of the Independent African states you are the shepherd of all African peoples everywhere, whether they are still at home on the mother continent or have been scattered abroad.

Some African leaders at this conference have implied that they have enough problems here on the mother con­ tinent without adding the Afro-American problem.

W ith all due respect to your esteemed positions, I must remind all of you that the good shepherd will leave ninety­ nine sheep, who are safe at home, to go to the aid of the one who   is   lost and has fallen into the clutches of the imperialist wolf.

.

We, in America � are your long-lost brothers and slsters, and I am here only to remind you that our problems are your problems. As the African-Americans "awaken" today, we find ourselves in a strange land that has rejected us, and, like the prodigal son, we are turning to our elder brothers for help. We p r ay our pleas will not fall upon deaf ears.

We were taken forcibly in chains fro m this mother continent and have now spent over 300 years in America,

suffering    the   most   inhuman   forms   of   physical   and psychological tortures imaginable.

During the past ten years the entire world has witnessed our men, women and children being attacked and bitten by vicious police dogs, brutally beaten by police clubs, and washed down the sewers by high-pressure water hoses that would rip the clothes from our bodies and the flesh from our limbs.

And all of these inhuman atrocities have been inflicted upon us by the American governmental authorities, the police themselves, for no reason other than we seek the recognition and respect granted other human beings in America.

Your Excellencies:

The American government is either unable or unwilling to protect the lives   and property   of your 2 2   million African-American brothers and sisters. We stand defense­ less. at the mercy of American racists who murder us at will for no reason other than we are black and of African descent.

Two black bodies were found in the Mississippi River this week; last week an unarmed African-American edu­ cator was murdered in cold blood in Georgia; a few days before that three civil-rights workers disappeared com­ pletely. perhaps murdered also, only because they were teaching our people in MisSissippi how to vote and how to secure their p olitical rights.

Our problems are your problems. We have lived for over 300 years in that American den of racist wolves in constant   fear of losing life   and   limb.   Recently,   three students from Kenya were mistaken for American Negroes and were brutally beaten by New York police. Shortly after that, two diplomats from Uganda were also beaten by the New   York   City police, who mistook them for American Negroes.

If Africans are brutally beaten while only visiting in America, im agine the physical and psychological suffer­ ing received by your brothers and sisters who have lived there for over 300 years.

Our problem is your problem. No matter how much independence Africans get here on the mother continent,

An Appeal to African Heads of State                    75

unless you wear your national dress at all times, when you visit America, you may be mistaken for one of us and suffer the same psychological humiliation and physi­ cal mutilation that is an everyday occurrence in our lives.

Your p roblems will never be fully solved until and unless ours are solved. You will never be fully respected u ntil and unless we are also respected. You will never b e recognized as free human beings until and unless w e are also recognized and treated as human beings.

Our problem is your problem. It is not a Negro prob­ lem, nor an American p roblem. This is a world p roblem; a p roblem for humanity. It is not a problem of civil rights but a problem of human rights.

If the   United States   Supreme Court justice, Arthur Goldberg, a few weeks ago, could find legal grounds to threaten to bring Russia before the United N ations and charge her with violating the human rights of less than three   million   Russian Jews, what makes our African brothers hesitate to bring the United States government before the United Nations and charge her with violating the human rights of 22 million African-Americans? We   pray that our African brothers h ave not freed themselves of European colonialism only to be overcome and held in check now by American dollarism. Don't let American racism be " legalized " by American dollarism. America is worse than South Africa, because not only is America racist, but she also is deceitful and hypocritical. South Africa preaehes segregation and p ractices segrega­ tion. She, at least, practices what she preaches. America preaches    integration    and    practices    segregation.    She preaches   one thing while deceitfully practicing another. South Africa   is like   a vicious wolf, openly hostile towards black humanity. But America is cunning like a fox,   friendly and smiling,   but even more vicious and deadly than the wolf.

The wolf and the fox are both enemies of humanity; both are canine; both humiliate and mutilate their victims. B oth have the same objectives, but differ only in methods. If South Africa is guilty of violating the human rights of Africans here on the mother continant, then America is guilty of worse violations of the 22 million Africans on the

American continent. And if South Afriean racism is not a   domestic issue,   then American racism also is not a domestic issue.

Many of you h ave been led to believe that the much p ublicized, recently passed civil-rights bill is a sign that America is m aking a sincere effort to correct the injustices we have   suffered there. This propaganda maneuver is part of her deceit and trickery to keep the African nations from condemning her racist practices before the United Nations, as you are now doing as regards the same prac­ tices of South Africa.

The United States Supreme Court passed a law ten years   ago   m aking A merica's segregated school system illegal. But the federal government has yet to enforce this law even in the North. If the federal government cannot enforce the law of the highest court in the land when it comes to nothing but equal rights to education for African­ Americans, how can anyone be so naive as to think all the additional l aws brought into being by the civil-rights bill will be enforced?

These are nothing but tricks of the century's leading neo-colonialist power.   Surely,   our intellectually mature African brothers will not fall for this trickery.

The Organization of Afro-American Unity, in cooper­ ation with a coalition of other Negro leaders and organi­ zations, has decided to elevate our freedom struggle above the domestic level of civil rights. We intend to "internation­ alize" it by placing it at the level of human rights. Our freedom struggle for human dignity is no longer confined to    the    domestic    jurisdiction    of the United    States government.

We beseech the independent African states to help us bring our   p roblem before the   United Nations, on the grounds   that   the   United States government is morally incapable of protecting the lives and the property of 2 2 million African-Americans. And o n the grounds that our deteriorating plight is definitely becoming a threat to world peace.

Out of frustration and hopelessness our young people have reached the point of no return. We no longer endorse patience and   turning-the-other-cheek. We assert the right

An Appeal to African Heads of State                    77

of self-defense by whatever means necessary, and reserve the right of maximum retaliation against our racist op­ pressors, no matter what the odds against us are.

F rom here on in, if we must die anyway, we will die fighting back and we will not die alone. We intend to see that our racist oppressors also get a taste of death. We are well aware that our future efforts to defend ourselves by retaliating - by meeting violence with vio­ lence, eye for eye and tooth for tooth - could create the type of racial conflict in America that could easily escalate into a violent, world-wide, bloody race war.

In   the   interests   of world peace   and   security,   we beseech   the heads   of the independent African states to recommend an   immediate investigation into our prob­ lem   by   the   United   Nations   Commission   on Human Rights.

If this humble plea that I am voicing at this confer­ ence is not properly worded, then let our elder brothers, who know the legal language, come to our aid and word our plea in the proper language necessary for it to be heard.

One last word, my beloved brothers at this African

summit:

" No one knows the master better tha n his servant," We have been servants in America for over 300 years. We have a thorough, inside knowledge of this man who calls himself " Uncle Sam." Therefore, you must heed our warning: Don't escape from European colonialism only to become even more enslaved by deceitful, "friendly" American dollarism.

May Allah's blessings of good health and wisdom be

upon you all. Salaam Alaikum .

Malcolm X , Chairman Organization of Afro-American Unity

Shortly after the OA U conference, Malcolm was inter­ viewed in Cairo by Milton Henry, attorney, former city councilman in Pontiac,   Michigan, and president of the

Ajro- 1- merican Broadcasting and Recording Company in

DetrOIt. From this interview, which was originally played over the Group On Advanced Leadership (GOAL) radio

program in Detroit, the following extracts about the con­

ference have been taken:

Milton   Henry:   Once   again the G OAL Show micro­ phones have with us our brother, Malcolm X. This time we   are   on the other side of the world. We're at Cairo, Egypt, where the independent African states have met in serious confrontation for the last week. One of the signifi­ cant additions to the confrontation here was the presence of Malcolm X as a black American delegate to the con­ ference of black peoples here in Africa. Malcolm, would you tell us something about the conference? First of all, we'd like to know about your appearance - how did it h appen that you as an American were permitted to appear at this conference of African people?

Malcolm: First, I want to point out that we are sitting here   along   the   banks   of the   Nile, and the last time I spoke to you we were in Harlem. Here along the banks of the Nile it's not much different from Harlem     same people, same feeling, same pulse.

About my appearing here at the conference: At first it did   create   a great deal of controversy, and, as you probably know, apprehension on the part of the powers that be in America, because they realize that if any direct contact, communication and understanding and working agreement are ever developed between the 22 million or 30 million Afro-Americans and the Africans here on the continent, there's nothing we couldn't accomplish. When I arrived here, there was a great deal of publicity in all of the press over here concerning my coming. It was his­ toric in a sense because no American Negroes had ever made any effort in the past to try and get their problems placed in the same category as the African problems, nor had they tried to internationalize it. So this was something new,   it   was unique,   and   everyone wondered what the reaction of the Africans would be.

lt   is   true   that   at   first there were stumbling blocks placed in my path in regards to being accepted into the conference, or into the meetings. But I'd rather not say what happened in specific details. Thanks to Allah, I was

An Appeal to African Heads of State                    79

admitted   a s a n observer   and   I   was able t o submit a memorandum to each one of the heads of state, which was read and thoroughly analyzed by them. It pGinted out the conditions of our people in America and the necessity of something being dGne and said at this conference toward letting the world know, at least letting the United States know, that our African brGthers over here identified them­ selves with our problems in the States.

Henry: Now, M alcolm, I have read the speech [memo­ r andum] which was presented . . . . Basically, as you say, it did deal with the abuses that the American Negroes have suffered in America and it asked the consideration of the African states of this problem. Now, will you tell us, was this actually passed upon, and did any action come Gut of the   Cairo conference with reference to the American NegrG?

Malcolm: Yes, a resolution came out, acknowledging the fact th at America has passed a civil-rights bill, but at the same time pointing out that, despite the p assage of the civil-rights bill, continued abuses of the human rights of the black people in America still existed. And it called upon - I forget the wording; when I read the resolution it was 2:30 in the morning, under very adverse condi­ tions; but I was so happy to read it. I n essence, I remem­ ber th at it outright condemned the racism that existed in America and the continued abuses that our people suf­ fered despite the passage of the civil-rights bill. It was a very good resolution.

Henry: In other words, this type of resolution coming out of a conference of thirty-four African states should certainly make the United States take a new look at the American Negro?

Malcolm:   Well,   I   have to say this, that the United States has been looking at the American Negro. When I arrived here I did a great deal of lobbying. I had to do a great deal of lobbying between the lobby of the HGtel Hilton, the lobby of the Shepheard and even the lobby of the " Isis," the ship where the African liberation movement was hGused. Lobbying was necessary because the various agencies that the United States has abroad had success­ fully convinced most Africans that the American Negro

in no   way identified with Africa, and that the African would be foolish to involve himself in the problems of the American Negroes. And some African leaders were saying this.

So in the memorandum I submitted to them at the conference I pointed out to them that as independent heads of states we looked upon them as the shepherds not only of the African people on the continent, but all people of African descent abroad; and that a good shepherd is more concerned with the sheep that have gone astray and fallen into the h ands of the imperialist wolf than the sheep that are still at home. That the 22 million or 30 million, what­ ever the case may be. Afro-Americans in the United States were still Africans, and that we felt that the African heads of state were as much responsible for us as they were re­ sponsible for the people right here on the continent. This was a sort of a challenge to them and I think that most of them realize it today, more so than they did prior to the conference.

Henry: M a lcolm. I think you are to be greatly ap­ plauded because actually you were the only American recognized as a p articipant of the conference, and of course you h ad the b adge which permitted you access to all of the rooms and so forth. The Americans here, including myself, did not have that privilege, but you had the privi­ lege of actually being with the other black brothers. I had the feeling that there will be a great change in emphasis because you have been here, and because you presented our position - the position of the black man in America - so well, in a way that no one but an American could. Malcolm: One thing that made most Africans see the necessity of their intervening on our behalf was [their learn­ ingl a bit of the historic steps since 1 93 9 in the so-called rise of the black American . . . . It was the world pressure, brought about by H itler, that enabled the Negro to rise above where he was [ in 1 9391. After Hitler was destroyed, there was the threat of Stalin, but it was always the world pressure that was upon America that enabled black people to go forward. It was not the initiative internally that the Negro put forth in America, nor was it a change of moral heart on the part of Uncle Sam - it w as world pressure.

An Appeal to African Heads of State                    81 Once this i s realized as   a basic fact, then the present American   Negro leaders will be more aware that any gain , even in token form, that they get, isn't coming from any goodness out of Washington, D. C., or from their own initiative - it is coming because of the international situ� ation. And when they see it like this, in cold facts, then

they will see the necessity of placing their problem at the world   level,   internationalizing the   Negro struggle and calling upon our brothers and sisters in Africa and Asia and Latin America, and even in some of the European countries, to bring pressure upon the United States gov­ ernment in order to get our problems solved. And this w as only the first of a series of steps that the OAA U has in mind to internationalize the black man's problem, and m ake it not a Negro problem or an American problem, but a world problem, a problem for humanity.

...           ...           ...

Henry: I think of another real benefit from this con­ ference, M alcolm. You are living in a very advantageou� spot,   because it so happens,   as you intimated just a minute ago, that you are living with all of the freedom fighters from all of the liberated and unliberated parts of the world down there on the " Isis" - is that the name of the boat?

Malcolm: Well, I don't know if I should say this, but it is true. The " IsiS," a beautiful y acht that floats on the Nile River, was set aside for all the liberation movements that exist on the African continent. The leaders of these m ovements from places like Angola, the Angola freedom fighters;   freedom   fighters   from   Mozambique; freedom fighters from Z ambia, known as Northern Rhodesia, which is just on its way toward independence; freedom fighters from Zimbabwe, known in America as Southern Rhodesia; freedom fighters from S outhwest Africa ; from Swaziland; Basutoland; and South Africa itself - all of the representa­ tives   of these different groups of freedom fighters were housed on this y acht called the " Isis."

I w as   very honored to be permitted to be housed right along with them. Spending so much time with them gave me a real feeling of the pulse of a true revolutionary, and it gave me an opportunity also to listen to them tell

82                                  Malcolm X Spi!f!,ks of the real brutal atm osphere in which they live in these colonized areas.    It also gave me somewhat of a better idea of our problem in America, and what is going to be necessary to bring an end to the brutality and the suf­ fering that we undergo every day.

Henry: I think that this is one of the advantages of a conference like the one we have just experienced. The fact is that it is important for people to get together to exchange   ideas. Even apart from the speeches and the organizational activities which go   on with   the formal o rganization, it would seem that, as you indicated, the opportunity for the leaders of each of these parts of the world to get together becomes an. invaluable asset to the total freedom struggle. Because without this, leaders very often feel they work by themselves; and with it, they can see the whole picture.

Malcolm: Yes, this is one thing that I have learned s ince being out of the Black Muslim movement. It's diffi­ cult to look at a thing through the narrow scope .of an organizational eye ofttimes and see it in its proper per­ spective.   If the various groups in America had been less selfish   and   had permitted different representatives from the groups to travel into foreign countries, and broaden their own scope, and come b ack and educate the move­ ments they represented, not only would this h ave m ade the groups to which they belonged more enlightened and more worldly in the international sense, but it also would have given the independent African states abroad a better un­ derstanding of the groups in the United States, and what they stand for, what they represent.

In my   opinion,   a   very narrow, backward, almost childish approach has been made by the groups in the United ' States, and especially the religious groups; very narrow minded. Whenever you belong to a group that just can't work with another group, then that group itself is selfish. Any group. any group that can't work with all other groups, if they are genuinely interested in solving the problems of the Negro collectively - why, I don't think that that group is really sincerely motivated toward reach­ ing a solution. This Organization of African Unity, this summit conference, is the best example of what can be

An Appeal to African Heads of State                    83 .

accomplished   when   people   come   together   and   their m otives aren't selfish.

*           *           .*

Henry:   Yes, it doesn't seem that it should be so dif­ ficult   for   Negroes,   if they   are sincere, to get together. Malcolm: If they are sincere, it is easy for them to get

together.

Henry: Perhaps those leaders will be p assed by now, in the events as they move forward. I am enthused about the   OAA U,   and   I   expect   that there will be some very concrete things happening with respect to that organiza­ tion   that will m ake the so-called civil-rights movement just a thing of the past almost.

Malcolm: Well, one of the m ain objectives of the OAA U is to join the civil-rights struggle and lift it above civil rights to the level of human rights. As long as our people wage a struggle for freedom and label it civil rights, it means   that we are under   the   domestic jurisdiction of Uncle Sam continually, and no outside nation can make any effort whatsoever to help us. As soon as we lift it above civil rights to the level of human rights, the prob­ lem becomes internationalized; all of those who belong to the United Nations automatically can take sides with us and help us in condemning, at least charging, Uncle Sam with violation of our human rights.

Henry: Yes, Malcolm, there is one other thing before

we leave. What do you think of this city of Cairo? Malcolm: Cairo is prob ably one of the best examples for the American Negro. More so than any other city on the African continent, the people of Cairo look like the American Negroes - in the sense that we have all com­ plexions, we range in America from the darkest black to the lightest light, and here in Cairo it is the same thing; throughout Egypt, it is the same thing. All of the com­ plexions are blended together here in a truly h armonious society. You know, if ever there was a people who should know how   to   practice brotherhood, it is the American Negro and it is the people of Egypt. Negroes just can't judge each other according to color, because we are all colors, all complexions. And as Mrs. W. E.   B. DuBois pointed out, the problems today are too vast. Just as on

the African continent, you have this wide range of com­ plexions - so much so   that you can't call it a brown struggle, a red struggle, or a black struggle . . . . Henry: By the way, Brother Malcolm, before we close, did you receive any promises of assistance or help from any of the African nations?

Malcolm: Oh, yes, several of them promised officially that, come the next session of the UN, any effort on our p art to bring our problem before the UN - I think it is the Commission on Human Rights - will get support and help from them. They will assIst us in showing us how to bring it up legally. So I am very, very happy over the whole result of my trip here.

Henry:   So this conference has been an unqualified

success from all standpoints?

Malcolm: From all standpoints it has been an unqual­ ified success, and one which should change the whole direc­ tion of our struggle in America for human dignity as well as human rights.

Henry: Thank you very much, Brother Malcolm.

In the preceding interview, Malcolm expressed satis­ faction with the OA U's resolution on "Racial Discrimina­ tion   in   the   United States of America. " This may have meant it was better than he had expected, or better than it would hane been without h is intervention. The actual wording of the resolution was moderate. It noted "with satisfaction the recent enactment of the Civil Rights Act designed to secure for American Negroes their basic human rights, " while declaring that the OA U conference was "deep­ ly   disturbed,   ho wever,   by continuing manifestations of racial bigo try and racial oppression against Neg ro citi­ zens of the   United States   of America. " The resolution concluded by reaffirm ing the OA U's "belief that the exis­ tence of discrim inatory p ractices is a matter of deep con­ cern to   member states   of the Organization of African Unity, " and by urging "the go vernment autho rities in the United States of America to intensify their efforts to ensure the total elimination of all forms of discrimination based on race, color, or ethnic origin. n

Malcolm 's effect on Africa should not be judged merely by the OA U resolution. Following the conference, he made a second, longer and m ore intensive tour of the continent, continuing h is own education but contributing in no small degree to the education of many Africans, in and out of government.

Independent testim ony to Malcolm 's impact on Africa was prov ided by John Lewis and Donald Harris, who v isited several African countries as representatives of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the fall of 1 964, when Malcolm was nearing the end of his tour of fourteen countries.   The following is taken from a written report by Lewis and Harris to SNCC, dated December 14, 1 964:

"Among   the first days   we were in Accra, someone said,   'Look, you guys m ight really be doing something - I don 't know,   but if you are to the right of Malcolm, you   m ight as   well start packing   right now 'cause no one 'll listen to you. ' Among the first questions we were continually asked was,   ' What's your organization 's re­ lationship with Malcolm 's? ' We ultimately fo und that this situation was not peculiar to Ghana; the pattern repeated itself in every country. After a day of this we found that we must, immediately on meeting people, state our own p osition in regard to where we stood on certain issues - Cuba, Vietnam, the Congo, Red China and the UN, and what SNCC's role,   guidelines,   and inv o lvement in the rights struggle was. Malcolm 's impact on Africa was just fantastic. In every country he was known and served as the main criteria for categ orizing other Afro-Americans and their political niews. "

Malcolm 's activities in Africa also had impact on high officials   in   Washington, D. C. On August 1 3,   1 964, the New York Times printed a dispatch by M. S. Handler

from Washington, which said in part:

"The State Department and   the Justice Department have begun to take an interest in Malcolm 's campaign to convince African states to raise the question of persecution of American Negroes at the United Nations . . . .

became available here only recently. After studying it, officials said that if Malcolm succeeded in convincing just one African government to bring up the charge at the United Nations, the United States government would be

faced with a touchy problem.

"The United States, officials here believe, would find itself in the same category as South Africa, Hungary and o ther countries whose domestic policies have. become de- . bating issues at the United Nations. The issue, officials say, would be of service to critics of the United States, Communist and non-Communist, and contribute to the undermining of the position the United States has asserted for itself as the leader of the West in the advocacy of

ing our plight before the UN this year. '

"Areording to one diplomatic r eP ort, Malcolm had not

met with success, but the report was not documented and officials here today conceded the possibility that Malcolm might have succeeded . . . .

"Although the State Department's interest in Malcolm 's activities in Africa is obvious, that of the Justice Depart­ ment is shrouded in discretion. Malcolm is regarded as an implacable leader with deep roots in the Negro sub­ merged classes. At one point in the Harlem riots, the same people who booed Bayard Rustin and James Farmer of

CORE shouted, 'We want Malcolm. '

"Malcolm 's identification with the 'streets in Harlem ' and his big following among Negro writers, actors, musi­ cians and entertainers is well known . .

" Handler continued:

"The spokesmen of some African states acted precisely within t h e fram ew o rk of t h ese recommendations last month in the Congo debate at the United Nations.
