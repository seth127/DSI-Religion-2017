The following is a selection of statements made by Malcolm X during the last three months of his life, taken from various interviews and answers to questions at

meetings.

A Con M an?

Malcolm: A   lot of people have warned me about the Village Voice.    It's supposed to be a liberal paper, but they say it is very narrow.

Marlene Nadle: Some people on the staff think you're

a con man.

Malcolm: If I wanted to be just a con man, I wouldn't be fool enough to try it on these streets where people are looking for my life, where I can't walk around after dark. If I wanted power, I could have gone anywhere iI1 the world. They offered me jobs in all the African countries. Muhammad is the man, with his house in Phoenix, his $200 suits, and his harem. He didn't believe in the black state or in getting anything for the people. That's why I got out.

Not Afraid of Investigation

Malcolm was asked if he would tell the House Un­ American Activities Committee the same things he had

just told a public meeting in New York.

Malcolm: I would welcome an opportunity to defend

The only thing   is: You   don't   question me behind closed doors. Keep it public,   and I 'll take anything you can throw. Keep it out in public.

Frankly,   I   don't   think   there   is   a   committee   in W ashington,   D. C., that can defend itself when it comes to the race   problem in this country. You are taken to Washington when they are trying to connect you with a foreign power. They treat black people in this country like we're foreigners. If we get connected with ourselves we're supposed to be subversive.

No, brother, I never worry about any kind of inves­ tigation. I think that our cause is just. And I think that our patience has been sufficient up to now to j ustify show­ ing   some   impatience. We' re justified. As I said earlier, both Johnson and Humphrey, when they wake up every morning, should thank God, whatever God they believe in, that black people have shown the patience that we've shown, or the ignorance that we've displayed. They should thank God, and they should try to do something about it before the impatience increases.

On Racism

Malcolm was asked the difference between white racism

and black racism.

Malcolm: Usually the black racist has been produced by the white racist. In most cases where you see it, it is the reaction to white racism, and if you analyze it closely, it's   not really black racism.   I think black people have shown less   racist   tendencies than any people since the beginning of history . . . .

If we react to white racism with a violent reaction, to me that's not black racism. If you come to put a rope around my neck and I hang you for it, to me that's not racism. Yours is racism, but my reaction has nothing to

do with racism. My reaction is the reaction of a human being, reacting to defend himself and protect himself. This is what our people haven't done, and some of them, at least at the high academic level, don't want to. But most of us aren't at that level.

Answer   to question, H arvard Law School Forum, December . 1 6, 1964

Question: What do you think is responsible for race

prejudice in the U. S . ?

Malcolm: Ignorance and greed. And a skilfully , de­ signed   program   of miseducation that goes right along w ith the American ' system of exploitation and oppression. If the entire American population were properly edu­ cated - by properly educated, I mean given a true picture of the history and contributions of the black man - I think many whites   would be less racist in their feelings. They w ould have more   respect for the black man as a human being.   Knowing what the black man's contributions to science and civilization have been in the past, the white man's feelings of superiority w ould be at least partially negated. Also, the feeling of inferiority that the black man has would be replaced by a balanced knowledge of him­ self. He'd feel more like a human being. He'd function more like a human being, in a society of human beings. So it takes education to eliminate it. And just because you have colleges and   universities, doesn't mean you haye   education.   The   colleges   and universities in the American educational system are skilfully used to mis- educate.

From interview on January 1 8, 1965, printed   in Young Socialist, March­ April, 1 965

Intermarriage and a Black State

Pierre Berton: Now before you left Elijah Muhammad and went to Mecca and saw the original world of Islam, you believed in complete segregation of the whites and

Last   Ans wers   and   /lItervielL't'j                        197

the Negroes. You were opposed both to integration and to intermarriage. Have you changed your views there? Malcolm: I believe in recognizing every human being as a human being - neither white, black, brown or red; and when you are dealing with humanity as a family there's no question of integration or intermarriage.   It's just one human being marrying another human being, or one hum an being living   around and with another human being.

I may say, though, that I don't think it should ever be put upon a black man,   I don't think the burden to defend any position should ever be put upon the black man,   because   it is the white man collectively who has shown that he is hostile toward integration and toward intermarriage   and   toward   these   other   strides   toward oneness.

So as a black man and especially as a black American, any stand that I formerly took, I don't think that I would have to defend it, because it's still a reaction to the society, and it's a reaction that was produced by the society; and I think that it is the society that produced this that should be   attacked,   not the reaction that develops among the people who are the victims of that negative society. Berton: But you no longer believe in a black state? Malcolm: No.

Berton: In North America?

Maicoi m : N o, I believe in a society in which people can live like human beings on the basis of equality.

The M an You Think You Are

Malcolm: I ' m the man you think you are. And if it   doesn't take legislation to make you a man and get your   rights   recognized,   don't   even   talk that   legis­ lative   talk   to   me.   No,   if we're   both human beings we'll   both   do   the   same thing.   And   if you want   to

Answer to question, M ilitant Labor Forum, .January 7, 1 965

H ow to Organize the People

Malcolm: The only person who can organize the man in the street is the one who is unacceptable to the white community. They don't trust the other kind. They don't know who controls his actions . . . .

Marlene   Nadle asked if he planned to use hate to o rganize the people. ,

.              .

Malcolm: I won't permit you to call It hate. Let s say I'm going to create an awareness of what has been done to them. This awareness will produce an abund ance of energy, both negative and positive, that can then be chan· neled constructively . . . .

The greatest mistake of the movement has been trying to organize a sleeping people around specific goals. You have to wake the people up first, then you'll get action.

Miss Nadle: Wake them up to their exploitation? Malcolm: No, to their humanity, to their own worth, and to their heritage. The biggest difference between the parallel oppression of the Jew and the Negro is that the Jew never lost his pride in being a Jew. He never ceased to be a man.   He knew he had made a significant con­ tribution to   the world, and his sense of his own value gave   him the courage to fight back.   It enabled him to .act and think independently, unlike our people and our leaders.

From   M arlene Nadle's article,   Vil­ lage Voi ce. February 25, 1965

Dollarism and Capitalism

Malcolm: It is true that most of your South American

Last Answers and Interviews                           199

countries are satellites of the United States. But they don't have to feel bad. This country made a satellite out of Khrushchev, made him lose his job. Everybody becomes a s atellite nowadays.

They   did - go   and study the relations between the United   States   and   Russia during the past four or five years   and   you'll find this country maneuvered Russia into almost becoming a satellite. They had to get rid of Khrushchev in order to get $ome of their independence

back.

I say that as objectively as I can. I'm not trying to jump into   anybody's   camp, I don't have any axes to grind.   This is just my own opinion from observations that I've made traveling around the world and listening with big ears.

It's easy to become a satellite today without even being aware   of it.   This country can seduce God. Yes, it has that seductive power - the power of dollarism. You can cuss out colonialism, imperialism and all other kinds of isms, but it's hard for you to cuss that dollarism. When they drop those dollars on you, your soul goes.

Answer to q uestion, M ilitant Labor I"orum, .January 7, 1 965

Question:   What is   your   opmlOn of the world-wide struggle now going on between capitalism and socialism? Malcolm: It is impossible for capitalism to survive, primarily   because the system of capitalism needs some blood to suck.   C apitalism used to be like .an eagle, but now it's more like a. vulture. It used to be strong enough to go and suck anybody' s blood whether they were strong or not.   But now it has become more cowardly, like the vulture, and it can only suck the blood of the helpless. As the   nations of the world free themselves, then capi­ talism has less victim s , less to suck, and it becomes weak­ er and weaker. It's only a matter of time in my opinion before it. will collapse completely.

The Police Commissioner

Harry Ring: A week or so ago, Police Commissioner Murphy asserted that the recent warnings of danger of a new outbreak in Harlem could actually provide the fuel for such an outbreak. I know that you were one of those who recently made such a warning. What would you say about this?

Malcolm: Well, Commissioner Murphy's attitude is one of the things primarily responsible for much of the ill feel­ ing among the races, and especially in the black communi­ ties   like   Harlem,   Bedford-Stuyvesant and other places. When he says -when he warns - against anyone mention­ ing that there is a great chance for continued violence this summer, what he is doing is trying to stick his head in the sand.

His attitude   is the same   as the   American attitude toward the   existence   of   China.   The   general American attitude is that Americans are supposed to pretend that 700 million Chinese don't exist, and that a little island off the coast of China is China. Well now, Commissioner Murphy has this same attitude toward the conditions that exist   in   the black community.   These conditions are so explosive that it is impossible for them to continue to exist without there being violent explosions.

Instead   of Police   Commissioner   Murphy involving himself in some kind of work that will eliminate the causes of these explosions, he wants to condemn the people who are pointing toward the continued existence of these con­ ditions and who at the same time are warning that the continued existence of the causes is going to create the explosions.

So I think that the police commissioner is probably the best example of an imbecile.   I hate to use this kind of word on your program, but he actually has a very imbecilic approach to the problems that exist in the black community, and his continued mouthing of this type of thing   will   do nothing to better the condition; rather, it makes the condition worse.

Public Notice to Rockwell

At a public rally of the Organization of Afro-American Unity in Harlem on January 24, 1 965, Malcolm said that on a television news broadcast he had seen Rev. Martin Luther King knocked down by a racist, that "it hu rt me, " and that if he had been there he would have gone to King 's aid. He also read aloud the text of a telegram he had sent to George Lincoln Rockwell, head of the American Nazi Party:

This   is   to   warn   you   that   I am no longer held in check    from    fighting    white supremacists by    Elijah Muhammad's   separatist Black   Muslim   movement, and that it your present racist agitation against our people there in Alabama causes physical harm to Reverend King or any other black Americans who are only attempting to enjoy their rights as free human beings, that you and your Ku Klux Klan friends will be met with maximum physical retaliation from those of us who are not hand­ cuffed by the disarming philosophy of nonviolence, and who   believe   in asserting our   right   of self-defense-by any means necessary.

On Politics

Malcolm was asked about the outcome of the recent

presidential election in the United States.

Malcolm: It isn't a president who can help or hurt; it is the system. And this system is not only ruling us in America, it is ruling the world. Nowadays, when a man is running for president of the United States, he is not running for president of the United States alone; he has to   be   acceptable   to   other   areas of   the world where American influence rules.

If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists,   the shrewd   imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly altern a-

I h ave to s ay this: Those who claim to be enemies of the system were on their h ands and knees waiting for Johnson to get elected - because he is supp o sed to be a m a n of peace. And at that moment he h ad troops invading the   Congo and South Vietnam!   He even has troops in areas where other imperialists h ave already w ithdrawn.

Malcolm: F irst, onr people have to become registered voters.   But they should not become involved actively in politics until we have gotten a m uch better understanding than we now have of the gains to be m ade from politics in this country.   We go into politics in a sort of gullible way, an emotional way, whereas politics, especially in this country,   �s   cold-blooded   and heartless. We have to be given a better understanding of the science of p olitics as well as becoming registered voters.

A nd then we shouldn't take sides either way with any of these p arties.   In my opinion, we should reserve our political action for the situation at hand, in no way identi­ fying with either p arty or selling ourselves to either p a rty, but taking p olitical action that' s for the good of human beings and that will eliminate these injustices. I , for one, do not think that   the present m an who' s in the White H ouse   is morally capable of taking the kind of action necess a ry to eli m inate these things.

Malcolm : The reluctance of Negroes to vote isn't al­ ways because they don't have the right to vote. Political m achines   in   m ost   states   and cities select as a rule [as candidates for political office j not black people who are intellectually   capable   to   deal with politics as it is, but

puppets   that   serve   as   their mouthpieces to control the politics of the community.   The black people i n H arlem have witnessed this thing year in and year out, and have seen   how   the   politics   of   Harlem,   and   other   :Negro communities   h ave   been   pretty   much   controlled   from outside.

It's   not   that   they ' re   politically lethargic or dead

they purposely have abstained. When you give them some­ thing to point toward, or vote for, you'll find that they ' ll be just as active as they've been inactive. It's the purpose of the OAA U to work among that element of politically in active black people. We intend to charge them and get them active out here, so we can get a little action.

Those who haven't been involved in politics actively are the ones who get invQlved in physical action. They have not seen anything that could be made to m aterialize in   politics   in the past, s o they didn't resort to politics. They resorted to things physical, to methods physical, if you understand what I mean. What we intend to do is try and harness their energy by giving them an under­ standing of politics.

Answer to question by member of dele­ ga t i o n   from   M cComb,   Mississippi, December 3 1 , 1 96-4

Malcolm: The gentleman asks me if I believe in politi­ cal action, number one. And if the leftist groups got to­ gether and put me up for mayor, would I run? I believe in   political   action, yes. Any kind of political action. I believe in action, period. Whatever kind of action is neces­ s ary. When you hear me s a y ''by any means necessary," I mean exactly that.   I believe in anything that is neces­ s ary   to   correct   unjust   conditions - political,   economic, s ocial,   physical, anything th at's necess ary.   I believe in it - as long as it' s intelligently directed and designed to gel results.

But I don't believe in getting involved in any kind of political   action   or other   kind of action without s itting down and a nalyzing the possibilities of success or failure. And I also don't believe that groups should refer to them­ selves   as   "leftist," "rightist," or "middle-ist." ! think that

Answer to question, Militant Labor Forum, ,J a nuary 7, 1965

Marlene Nadle, noting that Malcolm wanted to run militant black candidates for office, asked him if he would be a candidate.

Malcolm:   I   don't know at this point. I think I am more effective attacking the establishment. You can't do that as well once you're inside it.

Miss Nadle asked if he thought an all-black party like

the Freedom Now Party in Michigan was needed.

Malcolm: Yes, in some cases you have to create new machinery.   In   others it's   better to take over existing machinery. Either way, we're going to be involved in all levels of p olitics from ' 65 on.

Slumlords and Anti-Semitism

In his talk, "Prospects fo r Freedom in 1 965. " Malcolm referred to the slumlords who own the houses in Harlem, "but don 't live there r:hemselves; usually they live up around the Grand Concourse [Bronx] or somewhere. " In the dis­ cussion period first a woman, then a man, objected to this remark.

Malcolm: The lady said that she'd enjoyed herself, but she ceased to feel joyful - I ' m paraphrasing the question - when I mentioned the landlords living up on the Grand Concoutse. Well, they also live other places besides the Grand Concourse. But many of them live on the Grand C oncourse. This is no reflection on anybody on the Grand Concourse - only   on those who   are guilty, only those who are gUilty. I imagine if I said Central Park West or Central Park East, someone over there probably would h ave felt b ad.   But I can't think of all those places, you know.

Yes m a'am. [ Woman resumes speaking] What did you mean? You see there - you're touchy. You say it sounds like an anti- Semitic statement. Why does it sound like an a nti-Semitic statement? Are Jews the only ones who live on the   Grand Concourse? You know, you might have some Italians up there, or some Irish, or something else. But if Jews are the only ones who live up there, then you should investigate, and find out why. Now you're going to say I really sound a nti-Semitic. No, you let yourself in for it.

When you say that some of the black bourgeoisie also live on the Concourse, the implication of what you are saying is that some of our own people also are slum landlords. If you noticed, when I made my reference to the Concourse, I didn't say anything about any particular color. I mentioned slumlords and whoever lives up there. I included everybody. Some of you all are on the defen­ sive.   I   mean this.   It' s   a   dangerous thing, you know, to let yourself get to where every time someone's talking, you   think they' re talking about you.   It's not so good. Now, where the black bourgeoisie is concerned, and the bourgeoisie maintaining this particular bl ack estab­ lishment - H ere's a book, called The Negro Mood [by Lerone Bennett, Jr. ) - one of the best.   If you can't find this book anywhere else, you can get it from the Nation­ alist M emorial B ookstore, up on Seventh Avenue, between 12 5th   and   1 26th - Dr.   Michaux - The   Negro Mood. There' s a chapter in there called "The B lack Establishment," and you ought to read it. It tells you how the white power structure downtown controls the black community through the black establishment.

And   you'll   see that   it's   not the black bourgeoisie that supports the black leaders - it's the white power struc­ ture downtown. This is what they mean when they say a "responsible"   Negro   leader - one   that they have put in power and   use   to m aintain the status quo. When they refer to "responsible," that's what they're talking about. An "irresponsible" Negro leader is one who is not inside their b ag, you know -- he' s going s omewhere else.

M ilitant Whites and Blacks

Malcolm: The brother w anted to know what practical steps could be taken to confront this unjust situation that exists here in New York and get some meaningful results. The one m istake that h as been made in the struggle of the oppressed against the oppressor is that U's been factional­ ized too much - too m any factions. You've got downtown factions,   uptown   factions, crosstown factions and some b asement factions.   Instead   of them having any degree of coordination toward a common objective, usually they are divided and spend a lot of time either being suspicious of each other, or knocking at each other, or even out­ right fighting each other.

Whereas you h ave black people in H arlem who are militant,   they   don't go for white people downtown too much. no m atter how militant they are. Now the blacks who come downtown and mix with the whites who are militant, usually don't even know how to talk to the blacks who are still uptown. I had to bring this out. I 've noticed it from observation.

You   have   all types of people who are fed up with what's going on. You have whites who are fed up, you have blacks who are fed up. The whites who are fed up can't come uptown too easily because people uptown are more f-e d up tha n anybody else, and they are so fed up that it's not so easy to come uptown.

Whereas   the   blacks   uptown   who   come   downtown usually   are the type, you know, who almost lose their identity - they lose their s oul, so to speak - so that they are   not   in a position to serve as a bridge between the

militant   whites and the militant blacks; that type can't do   it.   I   h ate to hit him like that, but it's true. He has lost his   identity, he has lost his feeling, and usually ­ play it cool, please - he usually has actually lost his con­ tact with H arlem himself.   So that he serves no purpose, he's almost rootless, he' s not uptown a nd he' s not fully downtown.

So when the day comes when the whites who are really fed   up - I   don't   mea n   these jive whites, who pose as liberals and who are not, but those who are fed up with what is going on - when they learn how to really establish the proper type of communication with those uptown who are fed u p , a nd they get some coordinated action going, you'll get some changes. You'll get some ch anges. And it will take b oth, it will take everything that you've got, it will take that.

But how m any sitting here right now feel that they could truly identify with a struggle that was designed to eliminate the b asic causes that create the conditions that exist? Not very m any. They can jive; but when it comes to identifying yourself with a struggle that is not endorsed by the power structure, that is not acceptable, where the ground rules are not laid down by the society which you live in and which y ou're struggling against - you can't identify with that, you step back.

Oh, when things get bad enough, everybody gets into

the act. And that's what is coming - in   1 965.

Advice to a Nonviolent Heckler

A nonviolence advocate indignantly asked Malcolm if he thought the three civil-rights workers murdered in Mississippi were cowards. He interrupted the answer several times.   He said he had   been   to Mississippi. A woman shouted a challenge to Malcolm a bout going there. While the questioner g rew m ore heated and antagonistic, Malcolm remained calm throughout his reply.

Malcolm: Sir, I h ave great respect and admiration for

one who has the nerve to tie his own hands and then

walk out and let a brute brutalize him. I have to respect him because he's doing something that I don't understand. What he's doing is beyond my power to even comprehend. It would be like putting handcuffs on me and putting me in the ring   and telling me to fight C assius Clay, or Sonny

Liston, nonviolently. I don't think I could do it, and who­

ever could do it, you know - power to you . . .      .

All I suggest is, and I don't suggest it as condemna­ tion of COFO or S N C C - I know too many of them, they' re brave students, men, and all that. All that I'm saying is - since your approach, as you say, is "tactical" - a tactical approach is designed to get certain results. It's designed to keep you alive. It's designed to bring you victory. Why, we just can't say victory has been brought about. We can't say that it is preserving life . . . . I ' m not criticizing you or condemning you, but I'm questioning your tactics.   I ' m questioning your tactics. f Questioner speaks again]   No, no, if Schwerner could come b ack here and talk to you, or, what's the black one's name? Let me tell you something. I was over in

Africa and I read what they did to Chaney. They said

that they beat that black one to death; they shot the other two, but they said they beat every bone and every bone was broken. Now you know what? I think people who

tell our people to be nonviolent are almost agents of the

Ku Klux Klan. I don't think 1 965 will be a very non­ violent year. Your year was '64.

I'm going down to Mississippi myself, I've been in­ vited to go on down there, and Alabama and some of those other places, and you know - I just don't see non­ violence. [ Questioner speaks again] You can go with me.

[ Questioner   speaks   again.    Chairman:   "Can   we   have

some order? j I don't blame him - he's excited. I would be excited too. [ Questioner continues]

Now look here, brother, if you ' re going to be non­ violent in M ississippi, you should be nonviolent here too. I'll tell you why. It would be more "tactical" to be non­ violent with me than it would be to be nonviolent with the Klan. For a lot of reasons.

On Going Back to Africa

Malcolm was asked how he thought Afro-Americans would be received by the Africans if they should go b ack to Africa.

Malcolm: After lengthy discussions with m any Africans at all levels, I would say some would be welcome and some wouldn't be welcome. Those that have a contribution to make would be welcome, but those that have no contri­ bution to make would not be welcome; I don't think any of us, if we look at it objectively, could find fault with that. And I believe this, that if we migrated back to Africa culturally, philosophically and psychologically, while re­ m aining   here physically, the spiritual bond that would develop between us and Africa through this cultural, philo­ sophical and psychological migration, so-called migration, would enhance our position here, because we would have our contacts with them acting as roots or found ations be­ hind us. You never will have a foundation in America.

You're out of your mind if you think that this government is ever going to back you and me up in the same way that it b acked others up. They'll never do it. It's not in them .

As an exam pIe, take the Chinese. You asked me about Red China. The Chinese used to be disrespected. They used to use that expression in this country: "You don't h ave a   Chinaman's chance." You remember that? You don't hear   it lately.   Because   a   Chinaman's got more chance than they have now. Why? Because China is strong. Since   China   became   strong   and   independent,   she's re­ spected, she's recognized. So that wherever a Chinese person goes,   he is respected   and   he is   recognized.   He's not respected   and recognized because of what he as an in­ dividual h as done; he is respected and recognized because he has a country behind him, a continent behind him. He h as some power behind him. They don't respect him , they respect what's behind him .

By the same token, when the African continent in its independence is able to create the unity that's necessary to increase its strength and its position on this earth, so that Africa too becomes respected as other huge continents are respected, then,   wherever   people   of African origin, African heritage or African blood go, they will be respect­ ed - but only   when and because   they have something much l arger that looks like them behind them. With th at behind you, you will get some respect. Without it behind you, you can do almost anything under the sun in this society - pass any kind of law that Washington can think of - and   you   and   I will still be trying to get them to enforce that law. We'll be like that Chinaman [ about whom l they used to say, "He doesn' t have a Chinaman's chance." N ow you don't have a Negro's chance. But with Africa getting its independence, you and I will have more of a chance. I believe in that 1 00 per cent.

And this   is what I mean by a migration or going b ack to Africa - going back in the sense that we reach out to them and they reach out to us. Our mutual u nder­ standing and our mutual effort toward a mutual objective will bring mutual benefit to the African as well as to the Afro-American. But you will never get it just relying on Uncle Sam alone. You are looking to the wroq,g direction.

On Black Nationalism

Question: H ow do you define black nationalism, with

which you have been identified?

Ma/colm: 1 used to define black nationalism as the idea that the black man should control the economy of his community, the politics of his community, and so forth. But, when I was in Africa in :\lay, in Ghana, I w as speaking with the Algerian ambassador who is extremely militant and is a revolutionary in the true sense of the word ( and h as his credentials as such for having car­ ried on a successful rev olution against oppression in his country ). When I   t old him that my political, social and economic philosophy was black nationalism, he asked me very frankly, well, where did that leave him? Because he was white. He was an African, but he was Algerian, and to all appearances he was a white man. And he said if I define my objective as the victory of black nationalism, where does that leave him? Where does that leave revo­ lutionaries in Morocco, Egypt, Iraq, Mauritania? So he showed me where I was alienating people who were true revolutionaries, dedicated to   overturning the system of exploitation   that   exists on this earth by any means necessary.

So, I had to do a lot of thinking and reappraising of my definition of black nationalism. Can we sum up the solution to the problems confronting our people as black nationalism ? And if you notice, I haven't been using the expression for several months. But I still would be hard pressed to give a specific definition of the over-all philos-

Malcolm: I haven't changed. I just see things on a b roader scale. We nationalists used to think we were mili­ tant. We were just dogmatic. It didn't bring us anything. Now I know it's smarter to say you're going to shoot a man for what he is doing to you than because he is white. If you attack him because he is white, you give him no out. He can't stop being white. We've got to give the man a chance. He probably won't take it, the snake. But

we've got to give him a chance.

We've got to be more flexible. Why, when some of our friends in Africa didn't know how to do things, they went ahead and called in some German technicians. And they had blue eyes.

I'm on the African continent" - he had been an ambassador in   a couple of other African countries, and an African head of state   had   told me that this man was the best ambassador that America had on the African continent; that's why I talked with him.

He said, "As long as I'm in Africa, I deal with people as human beings." He said, "For some strange reason, color   doesn't enter into   it   at   all." He said, " I'm more aware of the differences in language than I am that there is a difference in color:   It's just a human atmosphere." He said, "But whenever I return to the United States and I ' m talking to a non-white person, I'm conscious of it, I'm self-cons.cious,   I'm   aware   of the color differences." So I told him, "What you're telling me, whether you te­ alize it or not, is that it is not b asic in you to be a racist, but that society there in America, which you all have created,   makes   you   a racist."   This is true, this is the worst racist s ociety on this earth. There is no country on e arth in which you can live and racism be brought out in you - whether you're white or black - more so than this country that poses as a democracy. This is a country where the social, economic, political atmosphere creates a sort   of psychological atmosphere that makes it almost im possible, if you 're in your right mind, to walk down the street with a white person and not be self-conscious, or he or she not be self-conscious. It almost can't be done, and it makes you feel this racist tendency that pops up. But it's the society itself.

My suggestion would be that young people, like your­ selves, many of whom are still in school and are more flexible in matters where you have not yet come to a con­ clusion,   sit b ack and weigh the thing for yourself and analyze it. If you can ever find what it is in the very at­ mosphere here that brings out these things, then perhaps you might be   able to save the country. You might be able to build a better society. But I have very much doubt that you can, I don't think that you can, change the gen­

eration that preceded you.

The Red Chinese Ambassador

Malcolm: What do I think about Red China in relation to the Afro-American? Well, I think that it is good to have centers of power on this earth that aren't controlled from either Paris, London or W ashington, D. C. I think when­ ever you have some power on the African continent or the Asian continent that can act in an independent way

it actually serves your and my purpose better. Becaus ;

the only time this m an gives you and me a break is when

he has something on the outside of his house that he's worried   about.   Then he lets those on the inside of his h ouse have a little more leeway than normal.

Plus, when I was in Ghana, I had an opportunity in May, and then again when I was in Africa a couple of weeks ago, to have dinner with the Chinese ambassador there. When I say the Chinese ambassador, I don't mean Chiang K ai-shek' s ambassador - I had dinner with the

Chinese   ambassador   that   represents   some 700 million

people - and I found the m an to be very intelligent ' very

well informed.

He acted more human than many of the Americans that I 've met. And he was well informed on the problem here. He didn't sound racist, he didn't sound fanatic he

didn't sound unreal, he seemed to have a very obje ct ive

picture in front of him, he didn't sound like he was anti­ American,   and he didn't sound like he was anti-white. In fact, he told me it was silly for a person to be placed, or allow himself to be placed, in the position of a racist. Now, this is from a Chinese ambassador, who's pro­ jected by the American press as representing a country that strictly deals in racism. If he wanted to impress me, s ince he had heard I was a racist, because that's all they

s ay' I am, he should have been talking some of that racist

talk to me. Instead, he was telling me that it's not wise and intelligent for a person to take the position of a r acist because you can't defend it. And this is true. You can't take a racist position and defend it. No, you don't have anything to base it on.

Nature of Coming W orld Showdown

Pierre Berton: There has been talk, I think by you, by Elijah Muhammad, about an Arm ageddon in the United

States by 1 984 . I ' m wondering if you still believe that,

and why t.1tat p articular date?

Malcolm: Much of what Elij ah Muhammad has taught, I don't think he believes in himself; and I say that and can easily defend it sitting opposite him. But where an ultim ate clash between East and West is concerned, I think that an objective analysis of events that are taking place on this earth today points toward some type of ultimate showdown.

You can call it a political showdown, or even a show­ down between the economic systems that exist on this earth which   almost boil down along racial lines. I do believe that there will be a clash between East and West. I believe that there will ultimately be a clash between the oppressed and those that do the oppressing. I believe that there will be a clash between those who want freedom, justice and equality for everyone and those who want to continue the systems of exploitation. I believe that there will be that kind of clash, but I don't think that it will be based upon the color of the skin, as Elijah Muhammad had taught it.

However,   I do think you'll find that the European powers, which are the former colonial powers, if they' re not able to readjust their thinking of superiority toward the darker-skinned people, whom they have been made to think are inferior, then the lines can easily be drawn­ they can easily be lumped into r acial groups and it will be a racial w ar.

Malcolm: We are living in an era of revolution, and the revolt of the American Negro is part of the rebellion against the oppression and colonialism which has char­ acterized this era . . . .

It is incorrect to classify the revolt of the Negro as sim ply a racial conflict of black against white, or as a purely American problem. Rather, we are today seeing a global rebellion of the oppressed against the oppressor, the exploited against the exploiter.

The Negro revolution is not a racial revolt. We are interested in practicing brotherhood with anyone really interested in living according to it. But the white man has long preached an empty doctrine of brotherhood which means little more than a passive acceptance of his fate by the Negro . . . .

would have to see that they would have to intervene in

And it is a good example of why our problem has to be internationalized. Now the Mrican nations are speak­ ing out and linking the problem of racism in Mississippi with the problem of racism in the Congo, and also the problem of racism in South Vietnam. It's all racism. It's all part of the vicious racist system that the Western powers have used to continue to degrade and exploit and oppress the people in Africa and Asia and Latin America during recent centuries.

And when these people in these different areas begin to see that the problem is the same problem, and when the 22 million black Americans see that our problem is the same as the problem of the people who are being op­ pressed in South Vietnam and the Congo and Latin America, then    the oppressed people of this earth make up a m ajority, not a minority - then we approach our problem as a m ajority that can demand, not as a minority that has to beg.

B ut they're trapped, they can't get out. You notice I s aid "they." They are trapped, they can't get out. If they pour more men in, they'll get deeper. If they pull the men out, it's a defeat. And they should have known it in the fIrst place.

Now, if she couldn't stay there and was entrenched, why, you are out of your mind if you think Sam can get in over there.

But we're not supposed to say that. If we say that. we're anti-American, or we're seditious, or we're subversive, or we're advocating something that's not intelligent. So that's two minutes, sir.

be in power. Never let them tell you it was an accident that Tshombe got in power. A very highly placed African official told me that one of the most powerful men in the State Department jumped on an airplane and followed an African leader all the way home over a year ago, begging him to use his influence to get other African heads of state to accept Tshombe as the prime minister of the Congo. This was out of Washington, D.C., where you and I send taxes . . . .

They put Tshombe there, because Tshombe was the only African who was criminal enough to participate in the scheme that the Western powers had of sending in Western troops after the so-called legal head of government would ask for them. You notice how they did this. They knew they would have to send Western troops over there to save the Congo for Western interests. But they had to have a man to make it legal who would call them in . . . . B y the way, if the United States justifies its entry into the Congo with its military forces simply because the head of state asks them, then Castro, who is the legal head of Cuba, was well within his rights to ask Russia to put missiles in Cuba. It's the same argument - if one is sovereign, both are sovereign.

Malcolm: Sure. When I was in the Black Muslim move­ ment I spoke on many white campuses and black campuses.

I knew back in 1 96 1 and '62 that the younger generation

was much different from the older, and that many students were more s incere in their analysis of the problem and

Last Answers and Interviews                         221

their desire to see the problem solved. In foreign countries the students have helped bring about revolution - it was the students who brought about the revolution in the Sudan, who swept Syngman Rhee out of office in Korea, swept Menderes out in Turkey. The students didn't think in terms of the odds against them, and they couldn't be bought out.

In America students have been noted for involving themselves in panty raids, goldfish-swallowing, seeing how many can get in a telephone booth - not for their revolutionary political ideas or their desire to change unjust conditions. But some students are becoming more like their brothers around the world. H owever, the stu­ dents have been deceived somewhat in what's known as the civil-rights struggle (which was never designed to solve the problem). The students were maneuvered in the direc­ tion of thinking the problem was already analyzed, so they didn't try to analyze it for themselves.

In my thinking, if the students in this country forgot the analysis that has been presented to them, and they went into a huddle and began to research this problem of racism for themselves, independent of politicians and independent of all the foundations (which are a part of the power structure), and did it themselves, then some of their findings would be shocking. But they would see that they would never be able to bring about a solution to racism in this country as long as they're relying on the government to do it . . . .

Question: What contribution can youth, especially stu­ dents, who are disgusted with racism in this society, make to the black struggle for freedom?

Malcolm: Whites who are sincere don't accomplish any­ thing by joining Negro organizations and making them integrated. Whites who are sincere should organize among themselves and figure out some strategy to break down prejudice that exists in white communities. This is where they can function more intelligently and more effectively, in the white community itself, and this has never been done. Question: What part in the world revolution are youth playing, and what lessons may this have for American youth?

In fact, when they shoot cap­ tive revolutionaries, they shoot all the way down to seven years old that's been reported in the press. Because the revolutionaries are children, young people. In these coun­ tries, the young people are the ones who most quickly identify with the struggle and the necessity to eliminate the evil conditions that exist. And here in this country, it has been my own observation that when you get into a conversation on racism and discrimination and segre­ gation, you will find young people more incensed over it - they feel more filled with an urge to eliminate it. I think young people here can find a powerful example in the young Sim bas in the Congo and the young fighters in South Vietnam. . .      .

W orking With Other Groups

Harry Ring: You've said that your attitude on many questions has changed in the past year. How about your attitude toward the established civil-rights organizations? Malcolm: I'm for whatever gets results. I don't go for any organization    be it civil-rights or any other kind ­ that has to compromise with the power structure and has to rely on certain elements within the power structure for their financing, which puts them in a position to be in­ fluenced and controlled all over again by the power struc­ ture itself.

I'm for anything that they're involved in that gets m eaningful results for the masses of our people - but not for the benefit of a few hand-picked Negroes at the top who get prestige and credit, and all the while the masses' problems remain unsolved.

Ring: B ut would you support concrete actions of these organizations if you feel they go in the right direction? Malcolm: Yes. The Organization of Afro-American Unity will support fully and without compromise any action by any group that is designed to get meaningful immediate results.

Marlene Nadle stated, "It's over the tactics of violence vs. nonviolence- or, as Malcolm puts it, self-defense V8. masochism - that he and other civil-rights leaders disagree. This dlfference is what has prevented the unity that he

feels is one of the keys to the struggle. "

Malcolm: It's not that there is no desire for unity, or that it is impossible, or that they might not agree with

me behind closed doors. It's because most of the organi­ zations are dependent on white money and they are afraid to lose it.

I spent almost a year not attacking them, saying let's get together, let's do something. But they' re too scared. I guess I will have to go to the people first and let . the lead­ ers fall in behind them.

[ That does not mean ruling out cooperatlon� I will try and stress the areas and activities where the groups can work together. ] If we are going into the ring. our right fist does not have to become our left fist, but we must use a common head if we are going to win.

Actions Worthy of Support

Harry Ring: I noticed that last week a group of H ar­ lemites, who had been without heat and hot water for over a week, went down to city hall and sat down in the mayor's office. A few days later, I read that the housing commissioner had decided that the city would make repairs on buildings that required it and bill the landlord. He m ade it known, and I had never known this before, that a law had been on the books for many years permitting the

city to do this, that they h ad done it during the depression a few times, but it's never been used since. Now it seems to me that this action by these H arlem tenants brought this about. Do you   think   that effective gains can be made through this kind of action?

MalcoLm: Definitely. Whenever our people are ready to take any kind of action necessary to get results, they'll get results. They'll never get results as long as they play by   the ground rules laid down by the power structure downtown. It takes action to get some action, and this is what our people have to realize. They have to organize and become involved in well-coordinated action which will involve   any   means   necessary to bring about complete elimination of the conditions that exist - conditions that are actually criminal. N ot only unjust, but criminal!

Question: H ow do you view the activity of white and black students who went to the South last summer and attempted to register black people to vote?

Malcolm: The attempt was good - I should say the objective to register black people in the South was good, because the only real power a poor man in this country has is the power of the b allot. But I don't believe sending them in and telling them to be nonviolent was intelligent. I go along with the effort toward registration, but I think they should be permitted to use whatever means at their disposal to defend themselves   from the   attacks of the Klan, the White Citizens Council and other groups.

The John Brown School

Malcolm: There are many white people in this country, especially the younger generation, who realize that the injustice that has been done and is being done to black people cannot go on without the chickens coming home to roost eventually. And those white people, even if they're

not   morally motivated, ·their intelligence forces them to see   that   something must be   done. And m any of them would be willing to involve themselves in the type of oper­ ation that you were just talking about.

For   one, when a: white man comes to me and tells me how liberal he is, the first thing I want to know, is he a nonviolent liberal, or the other kind. I don't go for any nonviolent white liberals. If you are for me and m y problem s - when I s a y me, I mean us, our people - then you have to be willing to d o as old John Brown did. And if you're not of the John Brown school of liberals, we'll get you later - later.

His Own M outh, His Own Mind

During the last m onth of his life, Malcolm made two speeches in the South, and was scheduled to make a third at   a   Mississippi   Freedom   Democratic Party   rally   in Jackso n.   The second was made on Feb ruary 4,   1 965, at the request of two Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee members, to the young demonstrators in Selma, Alabama, where Rev. Martin Luther King was then being

held in jail. A New York Herald Tribune repo rter wrote

that Malcolm 's speech "clearly disturbed the people run­ ning the registration drive . . . The young crowd cheered r Malcolm] repeatedly, and for h ours afterward o ther speak­ ers tried to simmer off the steam that Malcolm had gen­ erated. " Before the meeting, King 's aides, Rev. Andrew Young and Rev. James Bevel, cautioned Malcolm against inciting incidents, causing violence, etc.

Malcolm: Remember this: nobody puts words in my

mouth.
