       THINGS ARE WORSE THAN THEY SEEM    AND BETTER THAN THEY SEEM    (Revelation 2:8-11)        And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write:      The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life,      says this: "I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you      are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and      are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. Do not fear what you are      about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you      into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have      tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give      you the crown of life. He who has an ear, let him hear what the      Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall not be hurt      by the second death."              
        Smyrna was located about 35 miles north of Ephesus in Asia   Minor on the coast of the Aegean Sea. The city had supported Rome   for over 200 years and had earned the right to be the main seat of   emperor worship in Asia. In 26 B.C. Smyrna had won the privilege   of building the Asian temple to Emperor Tiberius.       There was a Jewish community in the city that came into bitter   conflict with the Christians. Verse 9 describes the relationship   like this. Jesus says to the church, "I know your tribulation and   your poverty (but you are rich) and the blasphemy (i.e., slander)   by those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are a synagogue   of Satan." In other words the Jewish synagogue was speaking things   about the Christians which the Christians regarded as slander (the   basic meaning of blasphemeo in Greek.).       This slander was probably in the form of official indictments   to the Roman authorities that the Christians put another king   above Caesar (which was true), and that they were rebellious and   dangerous (which was false). The Jewish community did not have the   right and power to punish the Christians, so they sought to get   them in trouble with the Roman government. For example, when Paul   planted the church in Thessalonica the Jews stirred up a mob and   said to the authorities, "These men have upset the world . . . and   act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is   another king Jesus" (Acts 17:6-7).       That's probably the sort of half-truth and incrimination that   were being hurled in Smyrna. The result of these charges was that   some of the Christians were being put in prison with a death   threat hanging over them. The reason I connect the slander of the   Jews with the imprisonment is the connection John makes between   verses 9 and 10. In verse 9 he says that the Jews who act this   way--who slander and thus deceive like Satan--are a "synagogue of   Satan." They follow Satan's temptation to lie and destroy. Then in   verse 10 he says that it is the devil that is going to throw the   Christians in prison: "The devil is about to cast some of you into   prison."       What connects verse 9 and 10 is the reference to the devil. In   verse 9 Jesus refers to "a synagogue of Satan" who are slandering   the Christians. In verse 10 he refers to the devil throwing some   Christians in prison. The natural understanding is that the way   the devil is throwing Christians in jail is by stirring up the   slander against them through those whom Jesus calls a "synagogue   of Satan." The reason he calls them a "synagogue of Satan" is   because they are so under the influence of Satan that they do his   work of slandering the Christians so effectively that the Roman   authorities think them a real threat to the empire and arrest   them.       So that's the situation in Smyrna. The Jewish synagogue, linked   up with the local Roman authorities, are coming against the   Christian church with official sanctions that are about to put   some Christians in prison and put some to death.       NOTE: Let me insert a parenthesis here about anti-semitism (by   which I mean hatred of Jews, and persecution of them, and ridicule   and caricature of them as a people, a derisive, scornful attitude   toward Jews. I have often wondered why there has been such a   strong stream of anti-semitism in the history of the Christian   church--something we should be ashamed of and repent of.       It has seemed amazing to me because Jesus was a Jew, and all   the 12 apostles were Jews, and the whole of our Bible was written   by Jews (except for Luke), and Jesus said, "Salvation is from the   Jews" (John 4:22), and to be Christian is to be grafted into the   covenant made with Abraham the first Jew (Rom. 11:17-24), and to   become a Christian is to become "Jewish"--a child of Abraham by   faith (Gal. 3:7).       And on top of all that, the day is coming when the nation of   Israel will be brought back to her Messiah and be saved and become   one with the Christian Church in the covenant of grace established   with Abraham (Rom. 11:25-6).       The effect of all this on Paul was that he was ready to be   accursed for the salvation of his kinsmen (Rom. 9:3). He did   everything that he might save some of them (Rom. 11:14). His   heart's desire and prayer to God was that they might be saved   (Rom. 10:1). He did not hate Jews, or ridicule Jews, or avoid   Jews. He risked his life for them again and again.       So how could so much anti-semitism (hatred and persecution and   ridicule) rise up in the Christian Church? Part of the answer is   found in texts like this one. It shows that the animosity from the   Jewish community toward the Christian church in the first two or   three centuries was immense. And it started to go both ways.       I only mention this as a partial explanation not as a   justification. Hatred and persecution and ridicule toward Jews as   a people is never justified. Our main disposition should be   Paul's: "My heart's desire and prayer to God is that they might be   saved." And so I exhort you: Don't joke about Jewishness. Don't   use cavalier stereotypes. Don't hate. Don't ridicule. If you pray   for Jewish people the way Paul and Stephen and Jesus did--with a   heart of longing for their salvation and love for them as the   estranged people of God--you will find it very difficult to make   jokes or speak disparagingly.       But here is another point that is more difficult to speak of   today. Jesus says in Revelation 2:9 that the Jews in Smyrna who   resisted their Messiah Jesus and turned with slander against those   who believe in Jesus were under the domination of Satan. Jesus   calls them a "synagogue of Satan." He means, I think, that they   had been deceived by Satan and were being used by him to get his   destroying work done against Christians. This was the same thing   Jesus said to the Jews who rejected him and wanted to kill him   when he was on the earth (John 8:40): "You are of your father the   devil; and you want to do the desires of your father" (John 8:44).       Now that kind of talk will be called anti-semitic today. Not   because there was hatred behind it (which there wasn't), and not   because Jesus aimed to stir up persecution of the Jews (which he   didn't), and not because he was maliciously ridiculing the Jews as   a people (which he wasn't), but because the very existence of   Christianity means that non-Christian Judaism has spurned the   Messiah and taken her stand against the Son of God which is   exactly what Satan does.       If Jesus is the Messiah, if he is the Son of God, and if there   is a great enemy and deceiver called Satan, and if the Jewish   people turn like Satan against the Messiah, then this must be   said.       But to say this is not hatred; it is not persecution; it is not   ridicule--there is no sneer or scorn or mockery or jest. There is   love. There is longing for salvation. There are tears. Jesus laid   down his life willingly for the Jewish people. Stephen prayed for   them as he was being stoned for pointing out their hardness of   heart (Acts 7:51,60). Paul was whipped five times by the Jews with   39 lashes for preaching the gospel of the Messiah, and he kept on   going to the synagogues first to bring them the hope of eternal   life. To speak the truth about the unbelief of Israel will be   called anti-semitism, but whatever they call it, let us not give   in to hate or persecution or ridicule.       There are two reasons I dwell on this issue of anti-semitism.   One is to do all I can to turn you away from hatred and   persecution and ridicule of God's estranged people, the Jews. May   we love them, and pray for them, and with truth and compassion   lead them to life in Jesus.       But the other reason goes beyond my concern with Jews and the   charge of anti-semitism and relates to anti-Christian attitudes in   general. I want to help prepare you for the hard truth that today,   just as in Revelation 2:9, the opponents of Christianity are going   to oppose us not by saying that we are wrong, but by saying that   we are evil and dangerous--anti-semitic, anti-choice, anti-woman,   anti-gay, anti-intellectual, anti-tolerance, anti-diversity, etc.   And they will do this in direct proportion to how public we are   about the claims of Christianity.       For example, at the University this week leaflets were given   out about the March for Jesus this Saturday       Say "No" to bigotry and hatred. Defend reproductive      freedom and queer rights. A group of so-called religious right      wing bigots are marching in a "March for Jesus", on Loring Park      in Minneapolis on June 12th . . . to advance their anti-queer,      anti-woman political agenda.        This is what was happening is Smyrna 1900 years ago and it is   still happening. When Christianity goes really public in a pagan   world (instead of remaining in our safe, isolated, comfortable   sanctuaries) the opposition labels us not as mistaken, but as evil   and dangerous.       The ironic and tragic response of many Christians in that   atmosphere of conflict is to simply disappear. And to think that   they are doing God a favor by stirring up no opposition to his   name.       That is not the way the Christians in Smyrna responded. Jesus   said in verse 10 that some would soon be cast into prison and that   they would be tested to the point of death--all brought on by   slander--by people who stood up and called them names. Jesus'   counsel to them was not to lay low and disappear. His counsel was   (v. 10b), "Be faithful unto death and I will give you the crown of   life."       That's the end of my parenthesis. Now I want to close with a   mere outline of the message I would have given if I didn't think   God wanted me to say all that. I think the outline is full of   power and shows us how to survive and thrive in this kind of   super-charged atmosphere of conflict and even danger.        The over-arching heading is this:          Things are worse than they seem         and better than they seem.        1. Point one is that things are worse than they seem.       1.1 Verse 9: the church in Smyrna is in tribulation and poverty   and is being slandered. They know that.       1.2 What they may not know is that the devil, and not just   people, are behind their persecution; that it will result in some   of them going to prison soon. And it will mean that some will be   tested to the point of death. If they think it is bad now (with   tribulation and poverty) it will get worse.       2. But more importantly--and this is the point of all these   letters to the churches--things are better than they seem. Mark   these six things, because they are as real and precious and   powerful today as they were 1900 years ago.       2.1 Verse 8a: Christ is the first and the last. Christ will   have the last word. This is what nullifies all slander. In the end   there will only be truth. Christ and not slander will be last.       2.2 Verse 8b: Christ died and has come to life. Christ went   through death before us. It is not the worst thing that can   happen. We will see what it is in just a second. Christ triumphed   over death, and all his people will too.       2.3 Verse 9: Christ knows your pain. "I know your tribulation   and your poverty." He is not a distant king. He is not unable to   sympathize with your weakness and trouble. He is near and he   knows. Don't resent that sometimes he leaves the pain. Be thankful   that he knows and cares and carries and will save.       2.4. Verse 9: You are rich. Even in poverty. Even in prison.   Even in death. You are rich. Blessed are the meek for they will   inherit the earth. "If you are children of God, then you are   heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ . . . the   sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that is about to   be revealed to us" (Rom. 8:15-18). You are rich!       2.5 Verse 10 (at the end): You will receive a crown of life.   "Be faithful unto death and you will receive a crown of life."   When the fight is fought and the race is run and you die at the   finish line, the wreath that will be put on your head will be the   crown of everlasting life--no more pain, nor more slander, nor   more shame, no more tears, no more depression, no more frustration   and discouragement. Only life and light and joy--and God for ever.       2.6 Verse 11b: You will not be hurt by the second death, that   is, the lake of fire (20:14). There is something worse than death,   namely, the second death. God is not mainly in the business of   sparing us from the first death, or the pain that leads to it. He   is utterly devoted to rescuing us from the second death.       So things are worse than they seem for the Christians in Smyrna   and for the Christians in Minneapolis. But far more important:   things are infinitely better than they seem.       Christ has the last word.       Christ is alive for evermore.       Christ knows your pain.       You are rich with the riches of Christ.       You will receive from him the crown of life.       He will not let you be hurt by the second death.       Amen!
