   December 12, 1982 (Morning)    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor               FROM BETHLEHEM IN THE MAJESTY OF THE NAME OF THE LORD     (Micah)              The book of Micah begins by telling us when Micah prophesied and the cities he     addressed. The word of the Lord which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of     Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and     Jerusalem. Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom, Israel, and Jerusalem was     the capital of the southern kingdom, Judah. The years of the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and     Hezekiah extended from about 735 to 700 B.C. So Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah     and prophesied during those tragic days when Assyria conquered Samaria, took the ten     northern tribes into captivity (722 B.C.), occupied Judah and besieged the holy city,     Jerusalem.         Micah is a hard prophet to understand because the book alternates back and forth     between threats of doom and promises of hope. It is hard to figure out what situations he     is referring to and how the hope and doom relate to each other. Probably the reason the     book is arranged like this is to make the point that where God and his people are     concerned there is always hope, even in the darkest catastrophe. So Micah mingles     gloom and glory through his book. We will take a look at the gloom first and then focus in     on his great promise about the Messiah who will come from Bethlehem in the Majesty of     the name of the Lord.         Prophets like Micah didn't bring doom; they simply announced the doom which Israel and     the nations brought on themselves through sin. For example, in 1:6,7, God's judgment on     Samaria is owing first to its idolatry, Therefore, I will make Samaria a heap in the open     country, a place for planting vineyards; and I will pour down her stones into the valley, and     uncover her foundations. All her images shall be beaten to pieces, all her hires shall be     burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay waste. In a universe created by God for the     display of his glory, the rejection of God brings down omnipotent opposition. God cannot     be righteous and yet be indifferent to unbelief.         Idolatry, then, always leads to sins which ruin human life. In 2:2,3, Micah puts his finger     on covetousness and stealing and oppression and pride:          They covet fields and seize them; and houses, and take them away; they oppress a       man and his house, a man and his inheritance. Therefore, thus says the Lord: Behold,       against this family I am devising evil, from which you cannot remove your necks; and       you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be an evil time.          Idolatry and haughtiness go hand in hand, and lead to covetousness and stealing and     oppression.         This spirit of greed was widespread even in Jerusalem, not just Samaria. In 3:9-11 Micah     tells us how covetousness corrupted justice and even made the leaders and priests and     prophets take bribes:          Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel, who       abhor justice and pervert all equity, who build Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with       wrong. Its heads give judgment for a bribe, its priests teach for hire; its prophets       divine for money; yet they lean upon the Lord and say, 'Is not the Lord in the midst of       us? No evil shall come upon us.'          The rulers abhor justice, pervert equity, shed blood and take bribes. Priests teach for     money and prophets tell you what you want to hear if you will pay for it. For all this Micah     promises doom and destruction: Samaria will become a heap of ruins (1:6) -- that     happened in 722 B.C. -- and Jerusalem will go into exile in Babylon (4:10) -- that happened     in 586 B.C. Micah was long since dead when Jerusalem fell. He didn't destroy the nation.     They destroyed themselves with idolatry, covetousness and perverted justice.         But mingled with all this gloom are glimpses of future glory for a repentant and humble     people. Micah describes in 6:7,8 what God requires if glory is ever to dawn over Israel.           Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall       I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?       He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you, but       to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.          In reverse the three requirements are a humble fellowship with God, that is, childlike     dependence on him; then a love for kindness, that is, a heart that loves to show mercy;           and then deeds of justice, that is, an active life, especially on behalf of those who are       mistreated.          I think these are the same three things Jesus had in mind when he criticized the     Pharisees in Matthew 23:23 for neglecting the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy     and faith. Humble faith in God's mercy to us inclines our own hearts to show mercy and     that leads us to seek justice for the mistreated.         But if that is true then what assurance does Micah give us that God will have mercy. The     picture of sin and judgment is so dark. Is there mercy and forgiveness with this avenging     God? Micah closes his book with words that leave no doubt in our mind.          Who is a God like thee, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the       remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger for ever, because he delights       in steadfast love  (cf. 6:8).           He will again have compassion upon us, and he will tread our iniquities under foot.       Thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. Thou wilt show faithfulness to       Jacob, and steadfast love to Abraham, as thou has sworn to our fathers from the       days of old  (7:18-20).         So there is great hope ahead for Israel if they will turn and do justice, love mercy and walk     humbly with their God.         But if we stopped here Micah's picture of the future would be like a portrait without a     person. I don't mean that God isn't a person; he is. And he will dwell in the midst of his     people. But you can't see God. He is spirit, he is invisible. Yet God wills to show us     himself as much as possible. Therefore from the days of David he promised to send a     human king through whom he would rule the world. And he would be so closely and     mysteriously identified with this king that the king would be called, Mighty God,     Everlasting Father (Is. 9:6). So when Isaiah or Micah paint a picture of God's future, the     visible person at the center is the Messiah. Therefore, to get Micah's whole picture of the     future glory we have to go to Micah 5:2-4, where he predicts the coming of Messiah out of     Bethlehem.          In prophesying these words about the coming of the Messiah Micah reveals to his     contemporaries and to us at least three things about God which should turn us away from     idols and cause us to want to trust God above all else. Let's read the text and then look at     these three things.          But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are little to be among the clans of Judah, from       you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose origin is from of       old, from ancient days. Therefore, he shall give them up until the time when she who       is in travail has brought forth; then the rest of his brethren shall return to the people of       Israel. And he shall stand and feed his flock, in the strength of the Lord, in the       majesty of the name of the Lord his God. And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall       be great to the ends of the earth.          The three things revealed about God are: First, God always acts to magnify his glory,     especially the glory of his freedom and mercy. Second, God keeps his promises. Third,     God protects his people. If those three things are true, then who would not want the Lord     above any idol? Who would not want to be protected by omnipotence and made an heir of     promises which involve infinite glory? So let me try to whet your taste for God by showing     how Micah reveals these three things.          First, God acts to magnify his glory. In 5:2, God speaks, and contrasts the littleness of     the town of Bethlehem with the greatness of the ruler who will come out of her. Bethlehem     is scarcely worth counting among the clans of Judah, yet God chooses to bring his     magnificent Messiah out of this town. Why? One answer is that the Messiah is of the     lineage of David and David was a Bethlehemite. That's true, but it misses the point of verse     two. The point of verse two is that Bethlehem is small. God chooses something small,     quiet, out of the way, and does something there that changes the course of history and     eternity. Why? Because when he acts this way we can't boast in the merits of men but     only in the glorious mercy of God. We can't say, Well, of course he set his favor on     Bethlehem, look at the human glory Bethlehem has achieved! All we can say is, God is     wonderfully free; he is not impressed by our bigness; he does nothing in order to attract     attention to our accomplishments; he does everything to magnify his glorious freedom and     mercy.         When God chose a replacement for king Saul, he sent Samuel to the little town of     Bethlehem. When he chose the sons of Jesse, he set his favor on the youngest not the     oldest (remember Jacob and Esau: the elder will serve the younger - Romans 9:12).     When God chose a man to defeat giant Goliath it was little David. When he chose a     weapon, it was a slingshot. Why? Why does God do his great work through little towns     and youngest sons and slingshots and mangers and mustard seeds? David tells us in 1     Samuel 17:45-47, just before he slays the giant. He says to Goliath,          I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom       you have defied. This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand ... that all the earth       may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all the assembly may know that the       Lord saves not with the sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give       you into our hand.           God uses little towns and youngest sons and slingshots to magnify his glory by contrast,     to show that he is not the least dependent on human glory or greatness or achievement.          The apostle Paul puts it like this in 1 Corinthians 1:27-31.           God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in       the world to shame the strong, God chose what is low and despised in the world, even       things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might       boast in the presence of God … Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.           God chose a stable so no inn-keeper might boast, He chose my inn! God chose a     manger so that no wood worker could boast, He chose the craftsmanship of my bed! He     chose Bethlehem so no one could boast, The greatness of our city constrained the divine     choice!         What then becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? The principle of     works and human merit? No! But on the principle of faith in God's mercy. For we hold that     a person is justified by faith apart from works of the law (Rom. 3:27,28). The divine choice     of little Bethlehem as the place of the incarnation is essentially the message of     justification by faith apart from works of the law. Bethlehem means that God does not     bestow the blessing of salvation on the basis of our merit or our achievement. He does not     elect cities or people because of their prominence of grandeur or distinction. When he     chooses he chooses in freedom in order to magnify the glory of his mercy. So when Micah     contrasts little Bethlehem with the greatness of the Messiah, he shows God acting in his     typical fashion: to magnify his glory and to turn human boasting into gratitude and praise     and faith. Glory to God in the highest, the angels said, and so should we.         Second, God keeps his promises. Any Jew, hearing Micah predict the coming of a ruler     out of Bethlehem who would feed his flock in the strength of the Lord, would think     immediately of two people: David and the coming son of David, the Messiah. David was     from Bethlehem; David was a ruler in Israel; David was a shepherd. The link between the     coming Messiah and king David is the link of promise. What Micah is doing is reasserting     the certainty of God's promise to David. You recall from 2 Samuel 7:12-16 how God said to     David, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body and I     will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name and I will establish the     throne of his kingdom for ever … And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for     ever before me; your throne shall be established for ever. The amazing thing about Micah     is that he reasserts the certainty of this promise not at a time when Israel is rising to     power but at a time when Israel is sinking toward oblivion. He witnesses the destruction of     the northern kingdom and he predicts the fall and exile of Judah.         You can tell how firmly someone believes God's promise by whether it gives him strength     and hope when life caves in around him. And Micah, it appears, never wavered. He knew     God would keep his promise.         There are not many things in our lives that are sure and unshakable. And the older we get     the less sure and the more shakable everything around us becomes, because our very     lives become fragile. I think that when I am 86 instead of 36 Christmas will be pleasant     with nostalgia and tinged with the sadness of loss. I think it must not be easy to know that     the Christmases you have left you can count on one or two hands. What does the world     offer to an octogenarian? Ah, when we were in our twenties and thirties and forties we are     prime targets for the PR of the flesh. Everything seems to have a firmness about it. But     near the end we get wiser. If the secular social worker at the nursing home lets me see     her eyes I can tell: beneath her projects and games and therapy she has nothing to offer,     nothing. Everything is withering, everything is fading, unless the word of God is sure. And if     it is there will be strength and hope and joy to the end. The point of Micah is that two     centuries and terrible circumstances do not nullify the word of God. What he has spoken     will come to pass. All flesh is grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field … The     grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of the Lord will stand for ever  (Isaiah 40:6-8).     God keeps his promises. And there is nothing more firm in all the world.         So the first thing we learn about God from Micah 5:2-4 is that God magnifies his glory and     the second is that he keeps his promises. There's a beautiful passage in Romans 15:8,9,     which shows how the coming of Christ confirmed both these truths. Paul said, For I tell     you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness in order to     confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the gentiles might glorify     God for his mercy. Christmas is intended to magnify the glory of God's mercy and confirm     the truthfulness of his promises.         Finally, we learn that God protects his people. Verse 4: He shall stand and feed his flock     in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. And they shall     dwell secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth. God's purpose in sending     the Messiah is not only to glorify himself but also to shepherd his people. Everybody in     this room needs a divine Shepherd. You may not feel that need now in your strength, but     you will feel it keenly, especially if you have to go through the valley of the shadow of     death without the comfort of his rod and staff. We need a shepherd, and God has sent     Christ just for that need.          Look what he offers in this verse. First, he will stand. He won't lie around waiting for us to     serve him. He will be on his toes, alert, working for those who chose him as their     shepherd. Second, he will feed his flock. He will not leave us to find our own food. He will     lead us in green pastures and beside still waters. There will be no want unsatisfied. Third,     he will serve us in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God.     His good intentions for us will not be hindered by lack of strength. The strength of the Lord     is omnipotent strength. Therefore, if you are trusting in Christ, omnipotent strength is on     your side. Walk like an obedient sheep behind him and he will overcome every obstacle to     your purification and joy for ever. Finally, notice that he shall be great to the ends of the     earth. There will be no pockets of resistance unsubdued. our security will not be     threatened by any alien forces. Every knee will bow and confess him Lord. The whole earth     will be filled with his glory.         So the sum of the matter is this. Jesus Christ has come out of Bethlehem. Like his town,     he was humble and obscure and poor in his first coming. But he will come again in great     glory to gather his flock into the kingdom. Micah's promise of his coming proclaims three     things to us about God that should make us want him above all else this Christmas. 1) He     magnifies the glory of his freedom and mercy. 2) He keeps his promises, through the     darkest times. 3) And he protects his people. Is there anybody here who doesn't want to     be protected forever by divine omnipotence? Is there anybody who doesn't want to be the     beneficiary of promises which involve infinite glory?          © COPYRIGHT John Piper
