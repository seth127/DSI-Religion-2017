   August 22, 1982 (Morning)    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor               FEAR NOT, YOU WORM JACOB!     (Isaiah 41:14)               Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your       redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.          The main point of this text is that the people of God should not be a fearful people. We should     not be a people who are anxious or troubled or worried or fretful about things that threaten our     life and happiness: economic adversity, hostile people, satanic opposition, guilt-laden     consciences, deteriorating health, and death. The mark of God's people is not incapacitating     fear, but rather contrite courageous confidence in God. That's the main point of Isaiah 41:14.    Then there are two subordinate points which clarify for us this experience of fearlessness.     First, God's people are in the condition of a worm: Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of     Israel. Second, the source of our fearlessness is the promise that God will help us: Fear not,     you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy     One of Israel. In other words, freedom from fretting comes not because we are not in the     condition of a worm but because God engages all his forces on behalf of worms who take     refuge in him.         These truths are very important today for three reasons: 1) There are as many temptations to     fear today as there were in the 8th century B.C. 2) The secular and religious culture in which     we live tries to teach us all day long that we are not in the condition of a worm and that all the     problems of our life come from thinking that we are. 3) There are many segments of the     church today where the grace of God is causing tears of joy, that the Holy One of Israel     should choose to take up residence in sinners like us. Satan has master-minded a     phenomenal victory in the American church. By teaching us through a thousand lectures and     articles and books that we are too valuable to be called worms, he has made it impossible for     us to sing Amazing Grace with truly amazed hearts. The more beautiful and valuable man is     made to appear, the less amazing it is that God should love him and help him. The gospel of     self-esteem is healing our wounds very lightly. The wings of self-worth that carry us briefly out     of fear will quickly weary and drop us in despair some day. For, as John Newton said in his     hymn, Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved. Where the glory     of God's free and sovereign grace pales in the shadow of human self-esteem, there will one     day be a great shudder of fear. When the Holy One of Israel rouses himself to get glory over     the nations in the vindication of his worm Jacob. So the word of God to his people in Isaiah     41:14 is a remarkably relevant and necessary word for our day. Fear not, you worm Jacob,     you men of Israel. For I will help you.         Let's focus in turn on these three points: 1) God's people are in the condition of a worm. 2)     Nevertheless, they should not be gripped by fear but enjoy great confidence in God. 3) For     God, in his free grace toward sinners, will always help those who trust him.         First, then, God's people are in the condition of a worm: Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men     of Israel! What did God mean when he called his servant, his chosen one, his beloved, a     worm? There are two other places in the Bible where this word refers to man. In Job 25:4-6     Bildad says to Job, How can man be righteous before God? How can he who is born of     woman be clean? Behold, even the moon is not bright and the stars not clean in his sight;     how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm! The least we can     say from this passage is that one meaning the term worm has when applied to man is that     he is unclean, unrighteous, unacceptable to God. The image is used probably because worms     are dirty not only on the outside but they are filled with dirt. The other passage is Psalm 22:6     where the psalmist cries out, I am a worm and no man; scorned by men, and despised by     the people. Here the focus is not on the condition of filth but on the way worms are treated:     they are scorned by men and despised.         Now when we look at our own text (Is. 41:14) there is evidence that both these meanings are     in view when God calls Israel a worm. On the one hand, Israel is presently being trodden down     in captivity by his enemies. Israel is despised and scorned, but God is going to reverse that     situation according to verses 15 and 16. He's going to make the worm a victorious threshing     sledge (v. 15). On the other hand, if we ask why Israel is being treated like a worm in captivity,     the answer is that Israel acted like a worm in uncleanness. Isaiah 59:1-8 says         Your iniquities have made a separation between you and God, and your sins have hid his face     from you so that he does not hear. For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with     iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness. No one enters suit     justly, no one goes to law honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive     mischief and bring forth iniquity. They hatch adders' eggs, they weave the spider's web; he     who eats their eggs dies, and from one which is crushed a viper is hatched. Their webs will     not serve as clothing; men will not cover themselves with what they make. Their works are     works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands. Their feet run to evil and they make     haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and     destruction are in their highways. The way of peace they know not and there is no justice in     their paths; they have made their roads crooked, no one who goes in them knows peace.         The reason God gave Israel over to captivity, to be treated like a worm was because Israel was     a worm in his heart. When Isaiah saw the Holy One of Israel he said (6:5), Woe is me! For I     am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.     The heart of Israel was corrupt to the core with pride and arrogance and self-exaltation. The     most religious people on earth were an abomination to God because of their haughtiness.     Isaiah warns the people in 2:11-17,          The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the pride of men shall be humbled;       and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day. For the Lord of hosts has a day against all       that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up and high; against all the cedars of       Lebanon lofty and lifted up; against all the oaks of Bashan, against all the high       mountains, and against all the lofty hills; against every high tower, and against every       fortified wall, against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft. And the       haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the pride of men shall be brought low; and the       Lord alone will be exalted in that day.          Once you begin to see that God is God, that it is he that made us, that he alone is to be     honored and lifted up in the world, that the magnificence of his power is 10 million times     greater than spaceship Columbia, that his right and authority over all things is absolute -- once     you begin to see that God is God, then it becomes very hard to overstate the wickedness of     the human heart in which there is one peep of rebellion against the Almighty. It is not an     exaggeration when God calls Israel a worm. On the contrary, God must settle for inadequate     words to describe the enormity of Israel's sin.         Now what does that have to do with us? The first thing to stress is that Israel is a lesson book     for all the nations. Paul said in Romans 3:19 that the law speaks to those under the law so     that every mouth might be stopped and the whole world might be held accountable before     God. God has illustrated clearly in the case of Israel what is true with all of us. None is     righteous, no not one (Rom. 3:10). All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (3:23).     Everyone is without excuse because God has revealed to all that he alone is to be thanked     and glorified (1:20f). Yet none of us offers God the gratitude and admiration and affection and     obedience of which he is worthy. The insult to God of our half-hearted, lukewarm, fickle     allegiance is so great when measured against what an infinitely wise and powerful and just     and merciful God deserves, that there only remains a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury     of fire (Hebrews 10:27). Brothers and sisters, if we felt a tiny fraction of how filthy and     loathsome our sinful hearts are to the Holy One of Israel, we could not begin to feel indignant     when we are called a worm.         What then shall we say about our own day and the dominance of the gospel of self-esteem --     the teaching that traces our problems back to the fundamental cause that we don't regard     ourselves highly enough? What can you say to the American church where by and large the     ultimate sin is no longer failure to honor God but the failure to esteem oneself; where self-    abasement not God-abasement is the ultimate evil; and the cry of deliverance from this evil is     not, O wretched man that I am, who will deliver me? but rather, O worthy man that I am,     would that I could only see it better? What shall we say?         The first thing I would say is this: Jacob is a worm. And until God has completed the     miraculous work of our sanctification and made us perfect, we will still have in us enough of     our old corruption to keep us poor in spirit and walking in all lowliness. I do not dispute that     Christ has paid for our redemption and that the Holy Spirit has entered our lives and begun to     transform us. But what needs to be emphasized is that to take this unimaginable, divine     condescension, this utterly free and unmerited grace by which God exalts his all-sufficiency     and to turn it into a story whose theme is my worthiness is a travesty of Biblical revelation.     What's more, it is not a contradiction of the atonement when I, a child of God, feel like a rotten     worm for sinning against the God who died for me. I ask you, what should I think about myself     when I sin? How should I regard my heart when it does not love mercy, is not aflame with     righteousness, feels no compassion for the lost, takes no delight in the Word, recoils from     prayer, harbors lustful thoughts, cherishes the praise of men? What adjectives shall I use to     describe this heart?         You may say to me: Call it forgiven. And I answer: I do. O, I do. I do. But listen, forgiveness     will not cause a ripple in the pool of my emotions unless I smell the stench of corruption in my     heart. What is missing in the gospel of self-esteem is a vivid and horrid portrayal of the     corruption remaining even in the Christian heart. C.S. Lewis said, When a man is getting     better, he understands more clearly the evil that is still in him. When a man is getting worse,     he understands his own badness less and less. And John Murray wrote, As long as sin     remains there must be consciousness of it, and thus conviction of our own sinfulness will     contain self-abhorrence, confession and the plea of forgiveness and cleansing. I think these     men are absolutely right. And therefore the only way that I know how to account for the ease     with which Christians accept the summons to self-esteem is that their sin has ceased to be     hideous and revolting in the eyes of their hearts. And sin has ceased to be hideous because     God is no longer God. He is not the free, all-glorious, sovereign Judge of history whose eyes     are too pure to look on evil. Instead he is a vague, sentimental granddaddy who somehow     functions to help us find self-worth. When God is dethroned as the Holy One of Israel, the     repugnance we once felt at pride is replaced by the repugnance we now feel at being called a     worm. But O that God might be God at Bethlehem!         Does this mean that God aims for us to cower before him and be incapacitated by guilt and     depression and fear? No. (And this is the second point from our test.) Fear not, you worm     Jacob! It does mean that we will be broken and contrite in spirit. And this brokenness will     permeate and humble all that we do. But it is not the enemy of joy and courage. Jonathan     Edwards, in one of my favorite portions, wrote,          All gracious affections that are a sweet odor to Christ, and that fill the soul of a Christian with     a heavenly sweetness and fragrancy, are broken-hearted affections. A truly Christian love,     either to God or men, is an humble broken-hearted love. The desires of the saints, however     earnest, are humble desires: their hope is an humble hope; and their joy, even when it is     unspeakable and full of glory, is an humble, brokenhearted joy, and leaves the Christian more     poor in spirit, and more like a little child, and more disposed to an universal lowliness of     behavior.    To know that there is corruption left in our hearts and that our feeble affections dishonor the     God who loved us, does not mean we lie still, wallowing in the mud of guilt. It means we flee     to Christ and cling to the cross and take refuge like little chicks under the wings of divine     mercy. And there we gain courage to love, not because we regard ourselves highly but     because we regard grace as our all-sufficient supply. The word to worms who will admit their     corruption, humble themselves, and take refuge in Jesus is, Fear not, you worm Jacob.    And the final point of the text gives the reason why, even though we are a worm, we need not     fear: I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. The good news     of the Bible is not that we are not worms, but that God helps worms who trust him. Yes, he is     working to take away our corruption. But how far has any of us come? The greatest thing     about being a Christian pastor is that what I have to offer people is not steps to a positive self-    image, but the gracious help of the Holy one of Israel.         The saddest thing of all about the gospel of self-esteem is how small and insipid it makes     everything. It takes gospel truths that for centuries have stunned the saints and made them     speechless with awe and reduces them to psychological devices in the service of our puny     self-image. I know that the Christians who promote the gospel of self-esteem say the grace of     God is the foundation stone. But I ask, is it the pinnacle as well? Is it exalted and lifted up and     magnified? Does the gospel of self-esteem leave you exulting and glorifying in the     unspeakable riches of God's sovereign grace to sinners like us? Or does it leave you exulting     in the discovery that you are really somebody?         My prayer for Bethlehem and my goal in preaching is that we might be a people who humbly     and broken-heartedly acknowledge the worm-like corruption remaining in our hearts; but who     trust with all our heart that in his grace God is for us because Jesus died for our sins; and who     therefore, are fearless and courageous in the proclamation and demonstration of God's grace     in the world.          © COPYRIGHT John Piper
