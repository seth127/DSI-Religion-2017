   October 10, 1982 (Morning)    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor               THE POOR OF THE LAND AND THE PRIDE OF JACOB     (Amos 6:1-8; 8:4-8)              Amos was a shepherd from Tekoa before God called him to be a prophet to Israel     (1:1;7:14,15). And even though Tekoa is in the southern kingdom of Judah (ten miles south     of Jerusalem) Amos delivered his message to the northern kingdom of Israel. His ministry     happened in the reign of Jeroboam II, probably nearer the end; which means that Amos     prophesied some forty to sixty years before the northern kingdom was taken into exile by     the Assyrians in 722 B.C. In retrospect we can see that Amos' warning of coming     judgment upon Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom (under Jeroboam) did not     cause repentance and did not save the people. From this was learned at the very outset     that the word of God may not always have the effect we desire. But we must be faithful like     Amos and speak what we are given from the Lord and trust that he has his secret     purposes in all he does, and that they are good. If an entire Biblical book seems to have     been preached in vain to a nation, don't think it strange that sometimes your own     testimony falls on deaf ears. The justification for speaking the word of God is not the     certainty of converts but the certainty of God's call: in the words of Amos 7:15, The Lord     took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, 'Go prophesy to my people     Israel.' But since Amos' word is from God and has been preserved for us in Scripture,     perhaps we had better measure its true success not by its effect on the cows of Bashan     (4:1) but by its effect on us sinners at Bethlehem.         The book is too big this time for me to give an exposition of each section. So what I would     like to try to do is picture Amos' message as a tree with roots, a trunk and a few     branches. The trunk is the central message of judgment. The roots are the sins of the     people which cause the wrath of God to grow. And the branches are the several calls for     conversion. What gives Amos his special power and impact even today is the way he     exposes the roots of Israel's sin to the light of day. So that is where we want to look     closest.         But first the trunk. The big, dark, unavoidable trunk of Amos is the relentless prediction     that judgment is going to fall on the northern kingdom of Israel. After our message from     Joel and Zephaniah you can guess what the coming day of judgment is called. Amos 5:18-    20, Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord! Why would you have the day of the Lord?     It is darkness and not light; as if a man fled from a lion and a bear met him; or went into     the house and leaned with his hand against the wall and a serpent bit him. Is not the day     of the Lord darkness and not light, and gloom with no brightness in it? The word that sets     the tone for the whole book of Amos is 1:2, The Lord roars from Zion. That's the keynote.     And in 4:12 you hear that awful warning, Because I will do this to you, prepare to meet     your God, O Israel! That's the trunk of the prophesy: the terrible day of the Lord is     coming. If you meet him in your rebellion you will meet him like a ravenous lion roaring out     of Zion. And if you turn to run you will meet him like a bear robbed of her cubs. And if you     hide in your house you will meet him as a rattlesnake on the windowsill. There is no     escape for unbelievers on the day of the Lord. Therefore prepare to meet your God, O     Israel.          What gives this trunk of judgment such strength and weight in the book of Amos is the     portrait that he gives us of God. Three times he pauses just to paint a picture of who the     Lord of judgment is. In 4:13 he tells us who it is we are supposed to prepare to meet. For     lo, he who forms the mountains and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his     thought; who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth -- the     Lord, the God of hosts, is his name. He makes mountains like Play-Dough, and mighty     wind with a whisper. He knows every thought of your mind before you speak it. He governs     all the workings of the solar system and steps from the Appalachians to the Rockies in     one stride. Do you want to meet him roaring from Zion or rejoicing over us with gladness?         Amos pauses again in 5:8 just to ponder who God is: He who made the Pleiades and     Orion and turns deep darkness into morning, and darkens the day into night, who calls for     the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth, the Lord is his     name. In other words, prepare to meet the God who builds constellations in space like     tinker toys, and spins the earth like a top in his hand, and beckons for a tidal wave like a     man whistles for a dog.         And finally, in 9:5,6, Amos pauses again before this God: The Lord God of hosts, he who     touches the earth and it melts, and all who dwell in it mourn, and all of it rises like the     Nile, and sinks again like the Nile of Egypt; who builds his upper chamber in the heavens,     and founds his vault upon the earth; who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them     out upon the surface of the earth -- the Lord is his name. As if to say in each of these     portraits: Remember, Israel, when I say the day of the Lord is coming I mean the     CREATOR! What will it mean when the creator says, I will set my eyes upon them for evil     and not for good! (9:4)?         So the large, strong, unavoidable trunk of this prophecy is the fierce judgment of God     coming upon the northern kingdom of Israel. The day of the Lord is darkness and not light     for those who have loved darkness. The Creator and Ruler of all things will roar out of Zion     against all his enemies. So prepare to meet your God, O Israel!         But now why has God determined such a terrible judgment against his people? What are     the roots that lead to this trunk? I see one main taproot which has sent out at least three     other roots, and together these four have caused the wrath of God to grow against Israel.     The taproot is that the people have forsaken God. The three roots that branch off from this     rejection of God are addiction to luxury, indifference to honesty and hard heartedness     against the poor. Let's look at these.         First, the taproot. Israel has forsaken God. In 4:6-11 Amos describes five acts of     chastisement that God had performed, each aimed at winning Israel's heart back to God.     But the result is the same each time. Verse 6: Yet you did not return to me, says the     Lord. Verse 8, Yet you did not return to me, says the Lord. Verse 9: Yet you did not     return to me, says the Lord. The same in verse 10 and the same in verse 11. The prophet     could scarcely make it clearer that the taproot of Israel's judgment is that she is far from     God and needs to return. Her heart is running after many things but not filled with God.         For many this expressed itself in outright idolatry, for example, in 5:26f: You shall take up     Sakkuth your king and Kaiwan your star-god, your images, which you made for     yourselves; therefore I will take you into exile beyond Damascus, says the Lord whose     name is the God of hosts. But there were other, more subtle, ways that their rejection of     God expressed itself. For example, in their sexual behavior, they scarcely gave God a     thought and brought disrepute on his name. In 2:7 it says, A man and his father go in to     the same maiden, so that my holy name is profaned. At the root of all sexual sin is an     indifference to the honor of God's holy name. There are many people today who, in the     Lord's house, talk as if God is real but in their sexual lives do not ask the question: Does     the holy God approve of my behavior and delight in my sexual habits? That kind of     compartmentalizing of God is a forsaking of God, and a preparation for judgment.         Another subtle way their rejection of God expressed itself was by going to church, giving     offerings, and singing hymns. Listen to this carefully now. Bethel and Gilgal were central     places of worship in Israel, and in 4:4,5 the Lord uses biting sarcasm to indict the     hypocrisy of the people:          Come to Bethel and transgress; to Gilgal and multiply transgression; bring your       sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days; offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving       of that which is leavened, and proclaim free will offerings, publish them; for so you       love to do, O people of Israel! says the Lord God.          Then 5:21-24:          I hate, I despise your feasts, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Even       though you offer me your burnt offerings and cereal offerings, I will not accept them,       and the peace offerings of your fatted beasts I will not look upon. Take away from me       the noise of your songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen. But let justice roll       down like waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream.          Amos is a devastating book for people who give token attention to God through     assemblies and songs, but whose hearts are much more genuinely engaged by sports or     business, or family or hobbies. If your outward acts of worship are a mask to give you     some respectability while your heart is really attached to the world and to your own     comfort, then God hates your worship and despises your solemn assemblies and offerings     and songs.    The taproot of Israel's sin was that her heart was far from God even in her tithes and     offerings and songs and assemblies. So when Amos calls for repentance in 5:4-6 the first     thing he says is,          Thus says the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek me and live; do not seek Bethel, and       do not enter into Gilgal or cross over to Beersheba, for Gilgal shall surely go into exile       and Bethel shall come to nought. Seek the Lord and live…          In other words, get real with God. Don't equate him with places of worship or acts of     religion. He is real. He is a person. Seek him. Know him. Love him. Have dealings with     him. Return to the Lord your God, lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph.    But Israel did not return to the Lord and so out from this taproot of rebellion against God     grew three very ugly roots that fed the trunk of God's wrath. Israel became addicted to     luxury, indifferent to honesty and hardened against the poor. She failed to heed the     warning God had given in Deuteronomy 8:17-19,           Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand have gotten me       this wealth.' You shall remember the Lord your God for it is he who gives you power to       get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant which he swore to your fathers as at this       day. And if you forget the Lord your God … I solemnly warn you this day that you shall       surely perish.          But in 6:13 Amos says to Israel, You rejoice in Lo-debar (i.e., a thing of nought) and say,     'Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?' God had allowed Israel to     prosper and her prosperity became her destruction. She fell in love with her luxury and     boasted in her strength and wealth. Amos gives God's response in 6:8, The Lord God has     sworn by himself (says the Lord the God of hosts): 'I abhor the pride of Jacob and I hate     his strongholds!' When God ceases to be the treasure of your heart more than likely your     heart will fasten itself on the pleasures and comforts of this life. And unless God     graciously intervenes, your addiction to comfort will make you indifferent to honesty and     hardened against the poor.         Listen to Amos' slam at the lovers of comfort in 6:1, Woe to those who are at ease in     Zion, and to those who feel secure in the mountain of Samaria. Verse 4: Woe to those     who lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches. Verse 6: … who     drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the finest oils but are not grieved over the     ruin of Joseph. Does that refer to anyone today: people who live for comfort and do not     grieve over the lost; people who are experts in loving themselves but have not thought the     first thought about what it means to love your neighbor as yourself. What governs your     getting and spending? Is it the desire to fill your little three score and ten with as much     comfort as you can? Or is it the God-given desire to do as much good for others as you     can to the glory of Christ? There is a warning in 3:15 which hits so close to home in     middle-class Minnesota that I hesitate to read it. But it's here, so I will: the Lord says, I     will smite the winter house and the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish     and the great houses shall come to an end. Take heed and guard your hearts diligently,     lest you find yourselves enslaved to comfort and addicted to luxury.         It doesn't stop there. The love of comfort leads to dishonesty and callousness toward the     needy. It may be that Amos was from a poor, small-town family (1:1; 7:14f). Whatever the     reason, he attacks this evil in Israel more than any other. His very first word against Israel     in 2:6,7 goes straight to the issue:         Thus says the Lord: 'for three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke the     punishment; because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes --     they that trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of     the afflicted.'         In 4:1 Amos gives a graphic picture a wealthy women in the upper crust of Samarian     culture: Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are in the mountains of Samaria, who     oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their husbands, 'Bring, that we may     drink!' Then in 5:12 he shows how corruption and callousness mingle: I know how many     are your transgressions and how great are your sins -- you who afflict the righteous, who     take a bribe, and turn aside the needy in the gate. And finally, in 8:4-6 we see how     religious hypocrisy and love for wealth, dishonesty and hardheartedness all combine:    Hear this, you who trample upon the needy, and bring the poor of the land to an end,     saying, 'When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath that     we may offer wheat for sale, that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great, and     deal deceitfully with false balances, that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a     pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat.'         These are the roots that feed the wrath of God in Amos' day and they feed his wrath in our     day: rebellion against God (even when cloaked with church attendance), addiction to     luxury and comfort, indifference to honesty, and hardness against the poor.         Now there are only a few branches that spring up out of the trunk of God's wrath, only a     few calls to repentance. One we saw in 5:6, Seek the Lord and live. So there is hope for     the converted. But 5:14,15 make it clear that conversion is more than just changing your     mind about God. It means exchanging love of comfort for love of goodness and justice.     Amos says,           Seek good and not evil, that you may live, and so the Lord, the God of hosts, will be       with you, as you have said. Hate evil and love good, and establish justice in the gate;       it may be that the Lord the God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.          O, to have a church full of people who don't care if they live in comfort, but who hate evil,     love good and who devote themselves to establish justice in the gate! People who feel grief     and indignation not just when their right to get rich is threatened, but also when children     die of starvation and anyone dies without salvation.         What does it mean to have justice established in the gate? I don't think it means to have a     society without distinctions, but a society without oppression. No more exploitation; no     more small print in the contracts; no more price-manipulating monopolies; no more Marie     Antoinettes who say of the poor, Let them eat cake. And no more Robin Hoods who     steal from the rich. No more central socialist committees who hold a gun to your head and     tell you how much of yours is really your neighbors, and no more fat capitalistic cats who     walk by Lazarus every day on their way to work off their latest five pounds of wine on the     silver running machine. No more false advertising; no more slipshod workmanship at $30     an hour. When every wage is fair, every contract is plain, every agreement is kept and     everyone strives for the advancement of his fellow man and not just his own -- and all to     the glory of God, then justice will be established in the gate.          And how shall we do it? By striving to produce men and women whose hearts are aflame     with the righteousness of God. And by struggling together to know what elements of     righteousness should be enacted into civil law. When a slumlord gouges a Laotian family     with exorbitant rent in the Phillips neighborhood, it is not necessarily because of bad laws;     it's because of a bad man. Therefore, we must guard ourselves against the naive idea that     those who work for rent control at city hall are necessarily working harder to establish     justice than those who work to convert evil men so that their hearts and business     practices will ring with the righteousness of Christ.         If America stays free -- which, by the way, is not the main goal of the church but, I pray, a     happy byproduct -- if America stays free, it will not be because Christian right-wingers     push through a prayer amendment, or because Christian left-wingers push through bigger     government subsidies for housing and health and jobs. It will be because the salt of the     earth and the light of the world have exerted such a profound spiritual effect on the heart     and soul of the nation that men and women feel pangs of conscience when contracts are     broken, and refugees are gouged, and prices are inflated and workmanship is shabby and     babies are intentionally aborted. Constraining civil laws are necessary in a fallen world. But     if violations of love are not treated at the spiritual spring, then the river of evil that flows out     of man's heart will break through every legal dam and sweep the world away with injustice.     One group on earth has this potential and this mission--the Church of Jesus Christ. If we     are not wholeheartedly engaged in this indispensable spiritual work, no one else will do it,     for no one else has the message of redemption. And justice will most assuredly then not     be established in the gate. And then who will stand when the Lord roars from Zion!          © COPYRIGHT John Piper
