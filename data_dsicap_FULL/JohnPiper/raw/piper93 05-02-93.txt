 May 2, 1993    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor           THE RIGHTEOUS ARE BOLD AS A LION"    (Proverbs 28:1)           What we saw last week from Philippians 1:27-28 is that Christians   are called to live a life that shows the worth of the gospel.   "Lead a life worthy of the gospel," Paul said. Let your life be an   advertisement for how valuable the gospel is.       And then Paul said that one of the effects that the gospel has   on the life of those who believe it is fearlessness. "Lead a life   worthy of the gospel so that when I come I may find that you stand   firm, unafraid of any of your opponents." In other words, one of   the ways that our lives show the worth of the gospel is when the   gospel makes us bold and courageous and unafraid.       Now what we see today in Proverbs 28:1 is a powerful   confirmation of that truth. It says, "The wicked flee when no one   is pursuing, but the righteous are bold as a lion." In other   words, there is a correlation between wickedness and fear on the   one hand, and righteousness and courage on the other hand. And the   gospel is a message about how wicked people can get right with God   through Jesus Christ so that they have a righteousness that makes   them as bold as a lion.       Let's begin our thinking about this verse by removing a   misunderstanding. When Proverbs says that "the wicked flee when no   one is pursuing," and, "the righteous are bold as a lion," it does   not mean that there are no bold wicked people, and no times when   the righteous become timid. It means that in general there is   something about wickedness that leads to fear and something about   righteousness that leads to boldness.       The reason we know this is because, for example, in Proverbs   14:16 it says that the fool "rages and is bold" (the same Hebrew   word as used here for what the righteous do--they're bold as a   lion). Most versions translate the word "careless"--"the fool   rages and is careless." The verse means that it is possible for a   fool who doesn't even believe in God, let alone the gospel, to act   in a bold and reckless way, and even risk his life.       So the point of Proverbs 28:1 is not that the wicked can't ever   act in bold and reckless ways. In fact for the sake of more   wickedness there is often an utterly foolish willingness to take   crazy risks (promiscuous sex, mind-altering drugs, dirty needles,   dangerous speeding, Russian roulette, all kinds of criminal acts).   Proverbs 28:1 doesn't have in mind that kind of boldness when it   says the righteous have it and the wicked don't. The boldness in   view is the boldness required for a just cause.       But what is it about the wicked that makes them so often flee   (in the presence of justice) when no one is pursuing? We can   answer that question from our own experience and from Biblical   examples. The answer is: a bad conscience. When you see a police   car ahead, is your response one of confidence and peace, or is it   one of fear and avoidance--even when he has no intention to pursue   you? Does the way you play basketball or soccer or football have   anything to do with how you feel when a whistle blows, even when   it's not blowing for you? Do you ever start defending yourself in   a conversation before anybody even criticizes you of something?       We flee when we're not even being pursued because we have a bad   conscience. There are enough stored up bad things we've done, that   a voice inside tells us someone is after us even when they are   not. Guilt is the parent of fear. Our conscience creates the   pursuer that ought to be there even when he is not there.       The earliest example of this is Adam in the garden of Eden. He   sins against the Lord. He acts wickedly, believing the serpent   instead of God his Father. Then Genesis 3:8 says that Adam and Eve   "heard the sound of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of   the day." Not stalking, just walking. He is not pursuing. He is   there, as he often was for the good of his people. But things were   not the same now. Adam and Eve now have a bad conscience. And a   bad conscience makes breezes into burglars and shadows into ghosts   and police into adversaries and parents into police and God into   an enemy--even when they are not.       Verse 8 goes on: "And the man and his wife hid themselves from   the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden." And   then the Lord called to the man and said, "Where are you?" And   Adam said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was   afraid."       Never before did Adam have to flee at the arrival of God. And   now he flees when no one is pursuing. Why? Because his conscience   condemns him and he hears this condemnation in every breeze that   blows and every creak in the door and every whistle on the field;   he sees it in every shadow and every flashing light; and he feels   it in the presence of God.       "The wicked flee when no one is pursuing." What this is   teaching is that you and I have a conscience given by God, and   that our conscience is committed to getting our accounts   settled--to making things right when we've done wrong. In fact,   this God-given conscience is so committed not to let us rest with   unrectified wrong that it will create pursuers out of nothing. A   guilty conscience will turn shadows into phantoms and ambulances   into police cars and innocent inquiries into indictments and   doorbells into threats and mailmen into warrant officers and   school teachers into wardens and parents into cross-examiners and   friends into traitors and simple office memos into termination   papers.       A guilty conscience will create pursuers out of anything unless   we drown it with alcohol, or numb it with drugs, or silence it   with endless blasts of music and flights from quiet solitude, or   harden it with constant denials. The wicked are people who will   not make right what they have done wrong nor set their face to do   good. And while the grace of God persists they flee when no one   pursues. But woe to the wicked who cease to hear the footsteps of   God in the garden.       The righteous are not so. The verse goes on, "The wicked flee   when no one is pursuing, but the righteous are bold as a lion."       Who are the righteous? Who are the lion-hearted righteous ones?   Let me take the one answer from Psalm 32, and then let Martin   Luther show us how he became righteous before God and how it made   him bold as a lion.       In Psalm 32:1-2 David says, "How blessed is he whose   transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered! How blessed is   the man against whom the Lord does not impute iniquity!" Then at   the end of the psalm David tells us what sort of person this is   whose sins are forgiven and whose transgressions are not counted.   Verses 10-11: "He who trusts in the Lord, loving kindness shall   surround him. Be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous ones   and shout for joy all you upright in heart."       The righteous ones are the ones who trust in the Lord--the ones   who have faith and bank their hope on the mercy and power and   wisdom of God. These are the ones against whom the Lord does not   impute iniquity and whose sins are forgiven. They are righteous   not with a righteousness of their own, but with the imputed   righteousness of God.       These are the ones who are free from fear. Their consciences   are "sprinkled clean from an evil conscience" (Hebrews 10:22).   Their hearts no longer condemn them (1 John 3:21). They are right   with God, because of his grace, not because of their merit. And   their boldness with God and with men shows the worth and the value   of the gospel (Hebrews 4:2,6) of God's grace.       The life of Martin Luther illustrates the connection between   getting right with God and a life of boldness. If it can be said   of anyone since the days of the apostles that "the righteous are   bold as a lion," it must be said of Martin Luther, the great   German reformer.       Luther was a monk who could not find peace with God because of   his sin. In the fall of 1515 Luther was lecturing in the   University of Wittenburg on the epistle to the Romans. The most   decisive event of his life happened. Here is the way he tells it:       I greatly longed to understand Paul's Epistle to the      Romans and nothing stood in the way but that one expression,      "the justice of God," because I took it to mean that justice      whereby God is just and deals justly in punishing the unjust.      My situation was that, although an impeccable monk, I stood      before God as a sinner troubled in conscience, and I had no      confidence that my merit would assuage him. Therefore I did not      love a just and angry God, but rather hated and murmured      against him. Yet I clung to the dear Paul and had a great      yearning to know what he meant.             Night and day I pondered until I saw the connection between      the justice of God and the statement that "the just shall live      by his faith." Then I grasped that the justice of God is that      righteousness by which through grace and sheer mercy God      justifies us through faith. Thereupon I felt myself to be      reborn and to have gone through open doors into paradise. The      whole of Scripture took on new meaning, and whereas before the      "justice of God" had filled me with hate, now it became to me      inexpressibly sweet in greater love. This passage of Paul      became to me a gate to heaven. 1         Luther had begun to see this in the Psalms (cf. Psalm 32:11-12   = Romans 4:7-8) in 1513-1514. Now he had seen it clearly in   Romans, the door to paradise was opened, he banked his hope fully   on the gospel and received the righteousness of God through faith   and became as bold as a lion.       His life was one long act of lion-hearted boldness against the   abuses of the Roman church and for the glory of the gospel.       His most famous stand was taken in 1521 at a kind of trial in   the city of Worms before the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Charles,   the local governor, Fredrick the Wise, the Archbishop of Trier   named Eck and a host of lords and princes. The power of the   assembly was enough to banish or execute him for heresy.       The prosecutor cried, "Do you or do you not repudiate your   books and the errors which they contain?" Luther replied,       Since then Your Majesty and your lordships desire a      simple reply, I will answer without horns and without teeth.      Unless I am convicted by Scripture and plain reason--I do not      accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have      contradicted each other--my conscience is captive to the Word      of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go      against conscience is neither right nor safe. &#91;Here I      stand, I cannot do otherwise.&#93; God help me.      Amen. 2         "The wicked flee when no one is pursuing (because their   conscience--the echo of God--condemns them), but the righteous are   bold as a lion" (because their conscience is made clean by the   righteousness of God imputed to them through faith in Jesus   Christ, and there is no condemnation). May the gospel of God's   free righteousness (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 1:17; Phil. 3:19) take us   captive like it did Martin Luther, and radically free us from   fear, so that we can be as bold as a lion for the sake of the   gospel!
