At the end of 1 964, a delegation of thirty-seven teen­ agers from McComb, Mississippi, came to New York for their Christmas vacation. The eight-day trip was spon­

sored by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

for young people who had been outstanding in the civil­ rights struggle in their home town.

The McComb youth attended various meetings and discussions in Harlem. Toward the end of their stay, on December 3 1 , 1 964, they visited the Hotel Theresa to learn what Malcolm X stood for. The following is a small por­ tion of what he told them.

One of the first things I think young people, especially nowadays, should learn is how to see for yourself and listen for yourself and think for yourself. Then you can come to an intelligent decision for yourself. If you form the habit of going by what you hear others say about someone, or going by what others think about someone, instead of searching that thing out for yourself and seeing for yourself, you will be w alking west when you think you're going east, and you will be walking east when you think you're going west. This generation, especially of our people, has a burden, more so than any other time in history. The most important thing that we can learn to do today is think for ourselves.

It's good to keep wide-open ears and listen to what everybody else has to say, but when you come to make a decision, you have to weigh all of what you've heard on its own, and place it where it belongs, and come to a decision for yourself; you'll never regret it. But if you form the habit of taking what someone else says about a thing without checking it out for yourself, you'll find

that other people will have you h ating your friends and loving your enemies. This is one of the things that our people are beginning to learn today- that it is very im­ portant to think out a situation for yourself. If you don't do it, you'll always be maneuvered into a situation where you are never fighting your actual enemies, where you will find yourself fighting your own self.

I think our people in this country are the best examples of that. Many of us want to be nonviolent and we talk very loudly, you know, about being nonviolent. Here in 'Harlem, where there are probably more black people concentrated than any place in the world, some talk that nonviolent talk too. But we fmd that they aren't nonviolent with each other. You can go out to H arlem Hospital, w here there are more black p atients than any hospital in the world, and see them going in there all cut up and shot up and busted up where they got violent with each other. My experience has been that in many instances where you find Negroes talking about nonviolence, they are not nonviolent with each other, and they're not loving with each other, or forgiving with each other. Usually when they say they're nonviolent, they mean they're nonviolent with somebody else. I think you understand what I mean. They are nonviolent with the enemy. A person can come to your home, and if he's white and w ants to heap some kind of brutality on you, you're nonviolent; or he can come to take your father and put a rope around his neck, and you're nonviolent. But if another Negro just stomps his foot, you'll rumble with him in a minute. Which shows you that there's an inconsistency there.

I myself would go for nonviolence if it was consistent, if everybody w as going to be nonviolent all the time. I'd say, okay. let's get with it, we'll all be nonviolent. But I don't go along with any kind of nonviolence unless every­ body's going to be nonviolent. If they make the Ku Klux Klan nonviolent, I'll be nonviolent. If they make the White Citizens Council nonviolent, I'll be nonviolent. But as long as you've got somebody else not being nonviolent, I don't want anybody coming to me talking any nonviolent talk. I don't think it is fair to tell our people to be non­ violent unless someone is out there m aking the Klan and

To Mississippi Youth                               139

the Citizens Council and these other groups also be non­ violent.

Now, I'm not criticiZing those here who are nonvioleJll. I think everybody should do it the way they feel is best, and I congratulate anybody who can be nonviolent in the face of all that kind of action in that part of the world. I don't think that in 1 965 you will find the upcoming gener­ ation of our people, especially those who have been doing some thinking, who will go along with any form of non­ violence unless nonviolence is going to be practiced all

the way around.                                         '

If the leaders of the nonviolent movement can go into the white community and teach nonviolence, good. I'd go along with that. But as long as I see them teaching nonviolence only in the black community, we can't go along with that. We believe in equality, and equality means that you have to put the same thing over' here that you put over there. And if black people alone are going to be the ones who are nonviolent, then it's not fair. We throw ourselves off guard. In fact, we disarm ourselves and make ourselves defenseless . .      . .

The Organization of Afro-American Unity is a non­

religious group of black people who believe that the prob­

lems confronting our people in this country need to be re-analyzed and a new approach devised toward trying to get a solution. Studying the problem, we recall that prior to 1 939 all of our people, in the North, South, East and West, no matter how much education we had, were segregated. We were segregated in the North just as much as we were segregated in the South. Even now there's as much segregation in the North as there is in the South. There's some worse segregation right here in New York City than there is in McComb, Mississippi; but up here they're subtle and tricky and deceitful, and they make you think you've got it made when you h aven't even begun to make it yet.

Prior to 1 939, our people were in a very menial posi­ tion or condition. Most of us were waiters and porters and bellhops and janitors and waitresses and things of that sort. It was not until war was declared with Germany, and America became involved in a manpower shortage

in regards to her factories plus her army, that the black man in this country was permitted to make a few strides forward. It w as never out of some kind of moral enlight� enment or moral awareness on the part of Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam only let the bla�k m an take a step forward

when he himself had his back to the wall.

In Michigan, where I was brought up at that time, I recall that the best jobs in the city for blacks were waiters out at the country club. In those days if you had a job waiting table in the country club, you had it m ade. Or if you had a job at the State H ouse. H a:ving a job at the State House didn't mean that you were a clerk or some­ thing of that sort; you had a shoeshine stand at the State H ouse. Just by being there you could be around all those b ig�shot politicians - that   made   you a big-shot Negro. Y ou were shining shoes, but you were a big-shot Negro because you were around big-shot white people and you could bend their ear and get up next to them. And ofttimes you were chosen by them to be the voice of the Negro community.

Around that time,   1 939 or '40 or '4 1 , they weren't drafting   Negroes   in the army   or the navy. A Negro couldn't join the navy in 1940 or '4 1 . They wouldn't take a black man in the navy except to make him a cook. He couldn't just go and join the navy, and I don't think he could just go and join the army. They weren't drafting him when the war first started. This is what they thought of you and me in those days. For one thing, they didn't trust us; they feared that if they put us in the army and trained us in how to use rifles and other things, we might shoot at some targets that they hadn't picked out. And we would have.   Any   thinking   man knows what target to shoot at. If a man has to have someone else to choose his target, then he isn't thinking for himself - they're doing the thinking for him.

The Negro leaders in those days were the same type we have today. When the Negro leaders saw all the white fellows being drafted and taken into the army and dying on the b attlefield, and no Negroes were dying because they weren't being   drafted, the Negro leaders came up and said, "We've got to die too. We want to be drafted too, and

To Mississippi Youth                                  141

we dem and that you take us in there and let us die for our country too." That was what the Negro leaders did back in 1 940, I remember. A. Philip Randolph was one of the leading Negroes in those days who said it, and he's one of the B ig Six right now; and this is why he's one of the Big Six.

So   they started drafting   Negro   soldiers   then, and started letting Negroes get into the   navy. But not until H itler and Tojo and the foreign powers were strong enough to put pressure on this country, so that it had its back to the wall and needed us, [did] they let us work in factories. Up until that time we couldn't work in the factories; I ' m talking about the N orth a s well a s the South. And when they let us work in the factories, at first they let us in only as janitors. After a year or so passed by, they let us work on machines. We became machinists, got a little more skill. If we got a little more skill, we made a little more money. which enabled us to live in a little better neighborhood. When we lived in a little better neighb orhood, we went to a little better school, got a little better education and could come out and get a little better job. So the cycle was broken somewhat.

But the cycle was not broken out of some kind of sense of moral responsibility on the part of the government. No , the only time that cycle was broken even to a degree was when world pressure was brought to bear on the United States   government.   They didn't look   at us as human beings - they just put us into their system and let us ad­ v ance a little bit farther because it served their interests. They never let us advance a little bit farther because they were interested in us as human beings. Any of you who have a knowledge of history, sociology, or political sci­ ence, or the economic development of this country and its race relations - go back and do some research on it and you'll have to admit that this is true.

It   was during the time that Hitler and Tojo made war with this country and put pressure On it [that] Negroes in this   �ountry   advanced a little bit. At the end of the war with Germany and Japan, then Joe Stalin and Com­ munist Russia were a threat. During that period we made a little more headway. Now the point that I'm making is

this: Never at any time in the history of our people in this country have we made advances or progress in any w a y based upon the internal good will of this country. We have m ade advancement in this country only when this country was under pressure from forces above and be­ yond its control. The internal moral consciousness of this country   is   bankrupt.   It   has n ' t existed since   they first brought us over here and made slaves out of us. They m ake   it a ppear they have our good interests at heart, but when you study it, every time, no m atter how m any steps they take us forward, it's like we're standing on a what do you call that thing?- a treadmill. The treadmill is moving backwards faster than we' re able to go forward in this direction. We're not even standing still - we're going backwards.

In studying the p rocess of this so-called progress during the   past   twenty years, we of the Organization of Afro­ American U nity realized that the only time the black man in this country is given any kind of recognition, or even listened to, is when America is afraid of outside pressure, or when she' s afraid of her image abroad. So we saw that it w as necessary to expand the problem and the struggle of the black man in this country until it went above and beyond the jurisdiction of the United States . . . .

I was fortunate enough to be able to take a tour of the African continent during the summer. I went to Egypt, then to Arabia,   Kuwait, Lebanon, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, T anganyika, Z anzibar, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Algeria. I found, while I w as traveling on the African continent, I h ad already detected it in May, that someone had very shrewdly planted the seed of division on this continent to m ake the Africans not show genuine concern with our problem, just as they plant seeds in your and m y minds   so that we w o n ' t show concern with the African problem . . . .

I also found that in m any of these African countries the head of state is genuinely concerned with the problem of the black m an in this country; but m any of them thought if they opened their mouths and voiced their concern that they would be insulted by the American Negro leaders. Be­ cause one head of state in Asia voiced his support of the

To   Mississippi   Youth                              143

civil-rights struggle [ in   1 963]   and a couple of the Big Six h ad the audacity to slap his face and s ay they weren't interested in th at kind of help - which in m y opinion is asinine. So the African leaders only had to be convinced that if they took an open stand at the governmental level and showed interest in the problem of black people in this country, they wouldn't be rebuffed.

And today you'll find in the United Nations, and it's not an accident, that every time the Congo question or a nything o n the African continent is being debated, they couple it with what is going on, or what is happening to you and me. in Mississippi and Alabama and these other places.   In my opinion, the greatest accomplishment that w as made in the struggle of the black man in America in 1964 tow ard some kind of real progress w as the suc­ cessful linking together of our problem with the African p r oblem,   or   making   our   problem   a   world   problem. B ecause   now,   whenever   anything happens   to   you   in MissiSSippi, it's not just a case of somebody in Alabama getting indignant, or somebody in New York getting indig­ n ant. The same repercussions that you see all over the world when an imperialist or foreign power interferes in some section of Africa    you see repercussions, you see the embassies being bombed and burned and overturned ­ nowadays, when something hap pens to black people in Mississippi, you'll see the same repercussions all over the world.

I   wanted   to point this · out to you because it is im­ portant for you to know that when you're in Mississippi, you're not alone. As long as you think you're alone, then you take a stand as if you're a minority or as if you're outnumbered, and that kind of stand will never enable you to win a b attle. You've got to know that you've got as m uch power on your side as that Ku Klux Klan has on its side. And when you know that you've got as much power on your side as the Klan has on its side, you'll talk   the   same kind of language with that Klan as the Klan is talking with you . .      .     .

I think in 1 965, whether you like it, or I like it, or they like it, or not; you will see that there is a generation of black people becoming m ature to the point where they feel

that they have no more business being asked to take a peaceful approach than anybody else takes, unless every­ body's going to take a peaceful approach.

So we here in the Organization of Afro-American Unity are with the struggle in Mississippi one thousand per cent. We're with the efforts to register our people in Mississippi to vote one thousand per cent. But we do not go along with anybody telling us to help nonviolently. We think that if the government says that Negroes have a right to vote, and then some Negroes come out to vote, and some kind of Ku Klux Klan is going to put them in the river, and the government doesn't do anything about it, it's time for us to organize and band together and equip ourselves and qualify ourselves to protect ourselves. And once you can protect yourself, you don't have to worry about being hurt . . . .

If you don't have enough people down there to do it, we'll come down there and help you do it. Because we're tired of this old runaround that our people have been given in this country. For a long time they accused me of not getting involved in politics. They should've been glad I didn't get involved in politics, because anything I get in, I ' m in it all the way. If they say we don't take part in the Mississippi   struggle,   we   will organize brothers here in New York who know how to handle these kind of affairs, and   they'll   slip into Mississippi like Jesus slipped into Jerusalem.

That doesn't mean we're against white people, but we sure are against the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens Councils;   and   anything that looks like it's against us, we're against it. Excuse me for raising my voice, but this thing, you know, gets me upset. Imagine that - a country that's supposed to be a democracy, supposed to be for freedom and all of that kind of stuff when they want to draft you and put you in the army and send you to Saigon to fight for them-and then you've got to turn around and all night long discuss how you're going to just get a right to register and vote without being mur­ dered. Why, that's the m ost hypocritical government since the world began! . . .

I hope you don't think I'm trying to incite you. Just

look here: Look at yourselves. Some of you are teen-agers, students� How do you think I feel - and I belong to a gen­ eration ahead of you - how do you think I feel to have to tell you, "We, my generation, sat around like a knot on a wall while the whole world was fighting for its human rights - and you've got to be born into a society where you still have that same fight." What did we do, who pre­ ceded you? I'll tell you what we did: Nothing. And don't you make the same mistake we made . . . .

You get freedom by letting your enemy know that you'll do anything to get your freedom ; then you'll get it. It's the only way you'll get it. When you get that kind of attitude, they'll label you as a "crazy Negro," or they'll call you a "crazy nigger" - they don't say Negro. Or they'll call you an extremist or a subversive, or seditious, or a red or · a radical. But when you stay radical long enough, and   get enough people to be like you, you'll get your freedom . . . .

So don't you run around here trying to make friends with somebody who's depriving you of your rights. They're not your friends, no, they're your enemies. Treat them like that and fight them, and you'll get your freedom; and after you get your freedom, your enemy will respect you. And   we'll   respect you. And I say that with no hate. I don't have hate in me. I have no hate at all. I don't have any hate. I've got some sense. I ' m not going to let some­ body who hates me tell me to love him. I'm not that way­ out. And you, young as you are, and because you start thinking, you're not going to do it either. The only time you're going to get in that bag is if somebody puts you there. Somebody else, who doesn't have your welfare at heart . . . .

I· want to thank all of you for taking the time to come to Harlem and especially here. I hope that you've gotten a better understanding about me. I put it to you just as plain as I know how to put it; there's no interpretation necessary. And I want you to know that we're not in way trying to advocate any kind of indiscriminate, unintelli­ gent action. Any kind of action that you are ever involved in that's designed to protect the lives and property of our mistreated people in this country, we're with you one thou-

s and per cent. And if you don't feel you' re qualified to do it, we have some brothers who will slip in, as I said earlier, and help train you and show you how to equip yourself and let you know how to deal with the man who deals with you .
